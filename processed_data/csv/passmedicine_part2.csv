"A 23-year-old male with no past medical history presents to the emergency department immediately after a high-speed motor vehicle accident. He was found on the side of the road after his motorbike collided with a car.

He has received morphine for analgesia and 500ml 0.9% NaCl as an IV bolus. He is alert and complaining of pain in his abdomen and back from the accident.

His heart rate 53 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and blood pressure 83/45 mmHg. Heart sounds one and two are present with no added sounds. There are vesicular breath sounds throughout the chest, with equal air entry bilaterally. He is peripherally warm with a capillary refill time <2 seconds. No external signs of haemorrhage are seen on full exposure.

A point-of-care ultrasound examining the liver, spleen, kidney and heart demonstrated no abnormalities. Electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities.

What is the most likely aetiology of his shock?

Septic
2%
Haemorrhagic
21%
Neurogenic
67%
Cardiogenic
10%
Anaphylactic
1%

Spinal cord transection after trauma can present with neurogenic shock
Important for meLess important
Traumatic spinal cord transection can result in autonomic nervous system disruption, causing either decreased sympathetic tone or increased parasympathetic tone. The resultant effect is a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance mediated by marked vasodilation.

This patient is unlikely to be suffering from hemorrhagic shock as there is no internal or external source of bleeding. Furthermore, tachycardia would be present if the shock were due to hypovolaemia.

Septic shock is unlikely due to the acuity of the event and lack of an infective source.

Cardiogenic shock is incorrect. There is no arrhythmia present and no signs of tamponade on ultrasound. Although his cardiac output has been reduced, this is due to interruption of the heart's autonomic innervation, not a cardiac cause. Hence, the shock is neurological in nature.

Anaphylactic shock is incorrect. There are normal breath sounds, along with no cutaneous signs of a hypersensitivity reaction. Hence, anaphylaxis is unlikely."

"Following a routine health-check at her GP surgery, 68-year-old Jenny, known to have epilepsy, is found to have an irregularly irregular heartbeat. This is later confirmed on a 12-lead-ECG to be atrial fibrillation.

"A 45-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department having had several episodes of vomiting with bright red blood but she is not currently bleeding. She has had some epigastric pain for several weeks but has not had haematemesis in the past. She denies melaena, dysphagia, syncope, and shortness of breath.

Her only past medical history is asthma, for which she has a salbutamol inhaler. However, she has not used this for many months. She also takes regular aspirin as she read in the paper that they are good for the heart.

On examination, her heart rate is 70/minute, respiratory rate 16/minute, blood pressure 138/90mmHg, saturation 98%.

Initial blood results demonstrate the following:

Hb 140 g/l
Platelets 200 * 109/l
WBC 4 * 109/l

Na+ 137 mmol/l
K+ 3.8 mmol/l
Urea 2.5 mmol/l
Creatinine 85 µmol/l

Her calculated Blatchford score is 0.

Of the following options, which action is most appropriate?

Discharge from the Emergency Department with advice and outpatient follow-up
60%
Send for emergency endoscopy
27%
Begin immediate fluid resuscitation, send crossmatch and request two units of blood
3%
Measure INR and begin vitamin K with possible fresh frozen plasma
4%
Begin Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy
6%

In an acute upper GI bleed, the Blatchford score can identify low risk patients who may be discharged
Important for meLess important
This lady has an acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and so could be very unwell. However, all her parameters are within normal range and she is not showing any signs of shock.

An acute upper GI bleed can be screened with the Blatchford (also known as the Glasgow-Blatchford) score. The features that are considered as part of this score are signs of shock, haemoglobin, urea, sex, and the presence of melaena, syncope, hepatic disease, or heart failure.

This patient would score zero on the Blatchford score and so would be suitable for discharge without needing further workup. However, many of these patients would go on to have an outpatient endoscopy to determine the underlying cause.

The other options:

1) Emergency endoscopy: this would be useful with a higher Blatchford score and to treat a significant upper GI bleed. Endoscopy is required to calculate the Rockall score which predicts mortality after an acute upper GI bleed.

2) Fluid resuscitation: haemodynamic instability would be the most pressing concern for any patient presenting with blood loss. However, this patient is showing no signs of requiring resuscitation or blood transfusion

3) INR, vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma: this might be a required for a warfarinised patient. However, this patient only takes aspirin which would not be reversed by vitamin K and would affect the INR

4) H pylori eradication therapy: whilst the history of epigastric discomfort might suggest that the cause of the bleed is an ulcer, starting eradication therapy would be premature at this point"

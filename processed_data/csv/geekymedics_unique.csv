"A 4-year-old boy is brought to see the GP by his parents, who cite concerns about his development. They have been tracking his progress using the child health record (red book) and have noticed that he has been missing the majority of his milestones and that his development is increasingly lagging behind what is expected. The parents report that he was slightly late in starting walking, with this not happening until 2 years, but it is their child's speech that is most worrying to them. He still cannot construct a sentence consisting of more than 2 words and has an extremely limited vocabulary. He seems relatively uninterested in social interaction, which is a major worry, as the boy is due to start school soon. 
On examination, the boy seems unwilling to interact with the doctor and avoids eye contact. He avoids speaking, instead, making incomprehensible noises that do not resemble words. The patient has a long, thin face, with extremely large ears, and when observed playing with some trains in the corner of the room demonstrates that he has hyper-flexibility of his finger joints.  
The GP makes a hospital referral for global developmental delay, where further investigations are carried out, including a full range of blood tests and a microarray. Given the patient's dysmorphic features, the paediatric consultant also sends a specific genetic test for a trinucleotide repeat expansion; it is this that clinches the diagnosis.

"An obese 42-year-old patient presents to the GP with persistent abdominal pain after eating. He describes a burning sensation under his ribs, with this sometimes travelling up towards his throat; this is particularly severe with large meals. Recently, he has suffered from recurrent bouts of hiccups; these can last a number of minutes and be distressing. The patient reports that he has sought advice for his symptoms previously, with a previous doctor informing him that reflux is the most likely explanation. However, treatment with omeprazole and over-the-counter Gaviscon recommended has not resulted in any improvement.
The patient reports a 3 stone weight loss over the past 6 months, although he has been attending a weight loss class during this time, with the aim of becoming a more healthy weight. He denies changes in appetite, changes in bowel habit or passing blood in his stools. Abdominal examination reveals no tenderness or masses on palpation. There is no lymphadenopathy elicited. 
Given the patient's non-response to PPI therapy, the GP makes a hospital referral. The consultant informs the patient that he may require an upper GI endoscopy; however, before this is carried out, he is booked in for a chest X-ray. This is reported as showing a significant degree of retrocardiac air; this allows for a diagnosis to be made without a need for more invasive investigations.

"A 63-year-old lady presents to A&E in excruciating pain; she reports that this started around an hour ago, and appears to come and go in waves. When asked to localise the pain, she points to her right-hand side and states that it radiates down into her groin. She has felt extremely nauseous, but has not vomited, and is desperate for some medication to relieve the pain. 
The patient informs you that she is currently undergoing chemotherapy for high-grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; she is now on her third round of treatment. Other than this, she takes no regular medications. Observations reveal an elevated pulse rate, but no fever, with normal blood pressure. 
The clerking doctor is suspicious she may have renal colic and orders several investigations. Urinalysis reveals blood (++) but no protein, leukocytes or nitrites. FBC reveals no signs of neutropenia. An abdominal X-ray is taken in A&E, as a CT scan cannot be arranged; this is reported as showing no evidence of a stone within the urinary tract. 
Blood tests reveal the following:
Na+ - 137 mmol/L
K+ - 5.7 mmol/L
Ca2+ - 2.0 mmol/L
Urea - 6.8 mmol/L
Creatinine - 72 μmol/L
The doctor tells the patient that her symptoms are likely to be a side effect of the chemotherapy she is receiving for her lymphoma; he asks her whether she was started on prophylactic medication before the regime was started.
Which of the following would have been appropriate to give to the patient before her chemotherapy regime as prophylaxis for the complications described above?

"A 34-year-old female presents to her GP with a 6-month history of episodic vertigo and hearing problems which have been getting worse. The patient describes several recent episodes in which it feels as though the room is spinning and she feels very nauseated. During these episodes, the patient reports also experiencing transient symptoms in her left ear which include a sense that ‘the volume has been turned down’ with regard to her hearing, a simultaneous high pitched ringing noise and a sense of pressure within the ear. The episodes typically last between 15-30 minutes, but more recently some have lasted an hour or two with the high pitched ringing lasting even longer. There is no clear trigger for these episodes which appear to occur at random. The patient denies any recent illness and feels otherwise well.
She has a past medical history of migraines, however, she has not experienced one in several years and takes no medication. There is no significant family history.
On examination, the patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. Inspection of the eyes reveals some horizontal nystagmus. Otoscopy is unremarkable. Rinne’s test is positive in the left ear and Weber’s test reveals lateralisation of sound to the right ear. Romberg’s test is positive. A cerebellar examination is unremarkable.

"A 56-year-old man presents to the GP complaining of problems with swallowing. He has noticed that larger pieces of food appear to get stuck, and it takes a great deal of effort to 'get them down'. This has been present for approximately 3 weeks, has not progressed, and affects solids only. He denies weight loss, any change in appetite, and has not noticed any abdominal pain or blood in his stools. He admits to having suffered from acid reflux for a number of years; he believes that this is likely to be linked to the fact that he is obese and has a poor diet, and has not presented to the GP about this. 
The GP ascertains that the patient meets the criteria for a 2-week-wait referral, and refers him for an upper GI endoscopy via this pathway. This reveals the presence of salmon-pink extensions of mucosa located 3cm above the gastro-oesophageal junction; biopsies are taken from this region, which reveals the presence of goblet cells. The pathologist has reported that there are no features of pleomorphism and that the architecture of the cells appears to be normal. The consultant informs the patient that he does not have cancer, much to his relief, rather, his oesophagus shows signs of metaplasia, where one cell type differentiates into another. 
Given the patient's history and endoscopy findings, which of the following changes is most likely to have occurred?

"A 24-year-old student presents to the GP after being strongly encouraged to do so by his partner, who is extremely concerned about him. He admits to having struggled over the last year; due to the COVID-19 pandemic he has felt isolated at university and admits to having a generally low mood for the past 3 months. 
The patient admits to getting little pleasure from his hobbies; he was previously a keen swimmer but has lacked the motivation to train even now this is possible given a recent relaxation in restrictions. He describes an increase in sleepiness; often spending most of the day in bed and that he has very low energy levels. Despite this, his appetite has increased, and he reports having gained around 3kg over the last few months. He has had problems concentrating, and has failed multiple modules of his course, which he is very ashamed about. Whilst the patient has often felt down and considered himself worthless, he has never considered harming himself; he credits this to the support of his girlfriend, for which he is very grateful. He states that his mood improves when he is around others and has the opportunity to distract himself. 
The GP makes a diagnosis of atypical depression given the patient's hypersomnia, increased appetite and improvement in mood during positive events. The patient seems unwilling to try CBT, and the GP prescribes antidepressant medication. Unfortunately, 6 months later, the symptoms are still persisting; neither sertraline nor venlafaxine have been of benefit. The GP informs the patient that he will try one more medication before making a specialist referral, and prescribes him phenelzine.

He denies any rashes and is bemused and frustrated about the origin of his symptoms. He informs the doctor that he has also experienced an uncomfortable burning sensation in his hands and feet, accompanied by an increased redness of these areas; this seems to be sporadic in nature. 
His past medical history is limited, other than two recent admissions for deep vein thromboses; these seemed to occur without a trigger, and as a result, he is currently taking apixaban.

The patient explains that they have also experienced frequent urinary tract infections, and often gets pains in a number of her joints after a long day at work. She stopped menstruating 3 months previously, and wonders if her symptoms are simply due to menopause; she denies any issues with her mood or sleep, and has no other past medical history of note. She reports drinking roughly 4 units of alcohol per week. 
There are no abnormalities on examination; the patient has no evidence of pallor, rather she appears relatively tanned. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. 
The GP informs the patient that menopause could account for a number of her symptoms, but orders a number of investigations to rule out other possibilities. FBC and U&E are both normal, however, LFT's demonstrate a mildly elevated ALP and ALT.

"A 12-month-old boy is brought to the GP by his father after the health visitor voiced some concerns about his son's development. The boy is still struggling to support himself in a seated position without assistance and crawls very infrequently. When pulled to a standing position, the child seems to lack any strength to support his torso, and his legs remain in an abnormal position; the child makes no attempt to take steps. There were no previous concerns about the boy's development, and he had been otherwise well, although a birth history elicits that he was born 7 weeks prematurely.

"A 24-year-old student presents to the GP after being strongly encouraged to do so by his partner, who is extremely concerned about him. He admits to having struggled over the last year; due to the COVID-19 pandemic he has felt isolated at university and admits to having a generally low mood for the past 3 months. 
The patient admits to getting little pleasure from his hobbies; he was previously a keen swimmer but has lacked the motivation to train even now this is possible given a recent relaxation in restrictions. He describes an increase in sleepiness; often spending most of the day in bed, and also that he has very low energy levels. Despite this, his appetite has increased, and he reports having gained around 3kg over the last few months. He has had problems concentrating, and has failed multiple modules of his course, which he is very ashamed about. Whilst the patient has often felt down and considered himself worthless, he has never considered harming himself; he credits this to the support of his girlfriend, for which he is very grateful. He states that his mood improves when he is around others and has the opportunity to distract himself. 
The GP makes a diagnosis of atypical depression given the patient's hypersomnia, increased appetite and improvement in mood during positive events. The patient seems unwilling to try CBT, and the GP prescribes antidepressant medication. Unfortunately, 6 months later, the symptoms are still persisting; neither sertraline nor venlafaxine have been of benefit. The GP informs the patient that he will try one more medication before making a specialist referral, and prescribes him phenelzine. 
Which of the following pieces of advice is the GP most likely to give to the patient regarding this medication? 
 
A. The patient should avoid contact sports when on the medication
B. The patient will need regular blood tests to monitor levels of the drug
C. The patient must avoid consuming grapefruit juice

He reports having grown significantly over the last year and is now significantly taller than the rest of his family. He puts this down to a 'growth spurt', but is concerned that the presence of striae may indicate that he is growing too fast; having been shown a picture of the skin lesions, he believes them to be unsightly. The patient denies any headache, visual changes or neurological features, and has not noticed any other changes in his appearance. 
The patient describes no past medical history other than recurrent lens dislocation which has been managed surgically. There is no family history of sudden growth, nor any other relevant medical conditions. On examination, the patient has a BMI of 18, with a slender frame; the patient exhibits no sign of coarsening facial features. The only other finding on examination of the other organ systems is the presence of a murmur; this is heard in late systole and is accompanied by an opening snap. 
The GP makes the decision to refer the patient to secondary care, where genetic testing is used to confirm that the patient's symptoms are due to an underlying inherited syndrome.
Given the likely cause of the patient's symptoms, which of the following tools is most likely to have been used to help make the diagnosis?

"The on-call paediatric consultant is bleeped to see a 1-day-old baby after concerns were raised by the doctor who carried out the infant's newborn physical examination. There were no concerns raised at the birth itself, and the delivery was via a successful Caesarian section. However, on examining the child, the doctor noted a pansystolic murmur, heard loudest in the fourth intercostal space at the left sternal edge. A repeat examination by the consultant elicited the same findings, and the child now appears unwell and slightly cyanosed. 
An urgent echocardiogram is performed; this is reported as demonstrating 'atrialisation of the right ventricle', with abnormalities of the tricuspid valve. The consultant informs the mother that the condition can often be treated surgically, although he warns her that there is the potential for complications later in life.

"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the hospital by his aunt as she is worried about a worsening of his ear-related symptoms. He initially presented to the GP 2 weeks previously with ear pain and itch that was affecting his sleep. He was prescribed topical steroid ear drops, with a suspected diagnosis of otitis externa due to eczema; however, his symptoms have not improved. The boy has now developed a fever and is complaining of a severe, 'boring' headache. He now has difficulty in opening his jaw and swallowing, which prompted his aunt to bring him to A&E. 
The boy has had a number of infections in the past and is under investigation for a suspected immunodeficiency syndrome. The admitting doctor is therefore extremely concerned about the boy's presentation, especially as observations recorded in A&E reveal a significant tachycardia and a drop in blood pressure. He tells the boy's aunt that he is worried about a rare complication of the initial ear infection, and starts some IV antibiotics as well as bleeping the on-call Paediatric consultant and ordering some relevant blood tests.

"A 17-day-old baby is brought into the hospital by his mother, who is concerned about the fact that he is jaundiced. This initially began around day 5 after birth, but she was reassured that this was likely due to the initiation of breastfeeding and should resolve. However, she believes that her son has become more yellow, and is worried about him. 
She describes the birth as being an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, with both her and the baby able to go home very shortly after. Since then, her baby has been feeding and sleeping well, with the heel prick test revealing no abnormalities. She has however noticed that recently his urine appears darker than normal; this appears to have coincided with the increase in apparent jaundice. She wonders if he is dehydrated and whether she needs to encourage him to feed more often. 
The paediatric consultant examines the baby; transcutaneous bilirubin measurement reveals that levels are significantly above the normal range for the baby's age. He orders serum bilirubin levels, which demonstrate an elevated concentration of conjugated bilirubin, and based on this result, orders an ultrasound scan, which confirms the presence of a congenital abnormality.

"A 12-month-old boy is brought to the GP by his father after the health visitor voiced some concerns about his son's development. The boy is still struggling to support himself in a seated position without assistance and crawls very infrequently. When pulled to a standing position, the child seems to lack any strength to support his torso, and his legs remain in an abnormal position; the child makes no attempt to take steps. There were no previous concerns about the boy's development, and he had been otherwise well, although a birth history elicits that he was born 7 weeks prematurely. 
The GP examines the boy; the child is happy to interact, and smiles and laughs at the doctor. He is able to demonstrate a partial pincer grip and has a monosyllabic babble. However, the boy holds his legs in a stiff abnormal position; the doctor notes increased tone in the lower limbs compared to the upper limbs and hyperreflexia when testing knee and ankle jerks.

"An 82-year-old patient is admitted to the hospital after falling over on his way to church; he landed awkwardly on the curb and is complaining of severe pain in his forearm. There is an obvious deformity on examination, but no signs of a break in the skin, and neurovascular examination reveals no abnormalities. 
A radial fracture is suspected, and an X-ray is ordered. This shows an oblique fracture of the proximal 1/3 of the radial shaft, without articular involvement or comminution. The radiologist reporting the scan has also commented on abnormalities of the bone itself; stating that there are several small areas of lucency visible, and the shaft of the radius appears bowed. The cortex of the bone appears abnormally thickened. 
The patient is otherwise well, with no known medical conditions, other than a recent diagnosis of hearing loss. This came on relatively rapidly but was diagnosed as presbyacusis by the GP. Investigations reveal a normal FBC and U&Es. Bone profile reveals an elevated alkaline phosphatase with calcium levels being within the normal range. 
The consultant responsible for the patient's care is suspicious of a pathological fracture and orders a bone scintigraphy scan.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this case? 
 
A. Multiple myeloma
B. Metastatic prostatic cancer
C. Hyperparathyroidism
D. Paget's disease of bone

"A 4-year-old boy is brought to see the GP by his parents, who cite concerns about his development. They have been tracking his progress using the child health record (red book) and have noticed that he has been missing the majority of his milestones and that his development is increasingly lagging behind what is expected. The parents report that he was slightly late in starting walking, with this not happening until 2 years, but it is their child's speech that is most worrying to them. He still cannot construct a sentence consisting of more than 2 words and has an extremely limited vocabulary. He seems relatively uninterested in social interaction, which is a major worry, as the boy is due to start school soon. 
On examination, the boy seems unwilling to interact with the doctor and avoids eye contact. He avoids speaking to either his parents or the doctor, instead, making incomprehensible noises that do not resemble words. The patient has a long, thin face, with extremely large ears, and when observed playing with some trains in the corner of the room demonstrates that he has hyper-flexibility of his finger joints.  
The GP makes a hospital referral for global developmental delay, where further investigations are carried out, including a full range of blood tests and a microarray. Given the patient's dysmorphic features, the paediatric consultant also sends a specific genetic test; this reveals the presence of an abnormal number of trinucleotide repeats.
Given the likely diagnosis, which of the following trinucleotides is likely to be repeated in this patient?
 
A. GAA
B. CTG
C. GCC
D. CAG
E. CGG

"A 24-year-old male is brought to A&E by his parents after they received a call from his partner stating that he had locked himself in the bathroom and threatened to end his own life. Fortunately, they were able to talk to the patient and persuade him to seek medical help before any attempts to harm himself were made.
The patient's parents inform you that this is not the first such episode that has occurred with their son; he has had a number of relationships over the past few years, and in each seems extremely happy - on multiple occasions he has confided in them that she believes that she is likely to be married to this new partner in the future.

There are two previous instances on record of the patient self-harming due to relationship concerns. 
The parents also describe that their son has always acted spontaneously, often making unwise decisions that 'get him into trouble', and that his self-esteem and perceived self-worth appears to greatly fluctuate. Given the patient's past medical history, the admitting doctor is concerned about the possibility of an underlying personality disorder.

The patient explains that they have also experienced frequent urinary tract infections, and often gets pains in a number of her joints after a long day at work.

"A 29-year-old woman is brought to the GP by her partner, who reports that she has been exhibiting some strange behaviour. He informs the doctor that she has recently been diagnosed with depression, and has been struggling to leave the house for the past few months after being made redundant. The patient was unwilling to attend CBT and was therefore prescribed sertraline; this appeared to improve the patient's mood, and she displayed increased energy, motivation, and began re-engaging with her previous hobbies. 
However, her partner is now concerned with some of her recent changes in behaviour; over the last 10 days, her energy levels have increased to a level where she states that she no longer needs to sleep to feel rested. She has begun to exercise excessively, despite previously showing little interest in this, and her libido is markedly increased; placing increased pressure on her partner to have sexual intercourse multiple times daily. She is described to appear to be 'in a constant hurry', with rapid speech and frequent flitting between activities. She appears disinterested in interacting with her partner or others, instead choosing to engage in a running conversation with herself. 
Her partner wonders if these symptoms are due to her antidepressant medication, and enquires whether the GP can adjust the dose of the drug.

"A 43-year-old woman presents to the walk-in eye clinic complaining of a 3 day history of decline in vision in her right eye. She reports that 'colours look funny' when she closes her left eye, and that moving her right eye causes her pain. She denies photophobia, itch or discharge from either eye. This is the first such episode that she has experienced, and has had no previous issues with her vision. 
The patient's past medical history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medication. On examination, visual acuity (assessed via Snellen chart) in the left eye is 6/6, compared to the right which is 6/24. The swinging flashlight test reveals that when the torch is swung towards the right eye after being shone into the left eye, it dilates rather than constricting. Fundoscopy reveals a normal red reflex and no abnormalities of the retina are visualised. 
The admitting doctor informs the patient that treatment for this condition will speed up the visual recovery but is unlikely to affect the final visual outcome, which is favourable. He warns her of a few side-effects of the treatment so that the patient is aware of these. 
Given the likely diagnosis and treatment initiated, which of the following side effects would it be most appropriate to warn the patient about?

"A 23-year-old Afro-Carribbean woman presents to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe chest pain and a cough. You are unable to take a history because the patient does not speak fluent English, and there are no translators available. You are able to ascertain that the patient has a persistent central sharp chest pain, and you administer appropriate analgesics for this, while also carrying out a 3-lead ECG, ordering a chest X-ray, obtaining IV access and taking multiple blood samples.
Examination of the patient reveals a tender swelling of her hands and feet, as well as scleral icterus. You are able to ascertain that her chest pain is worse on inspiration.
Observations are taken, and reveal the following:
Temperature 38.8 °C
Blood pressure (BP) 122/86 mmHg
Heart rate 120 bpm
Respiratory rate 24 breaths/min
Pa(O2) 88%
You administer 15 litres of oxygen through a non-rebreather mask, and in light of the above results you also take a sample for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. See results below:
Investigation Result Normal range
pH 7.40 7.35–7.45
p(O2) 70 mmHg 80–100 mmHg
p(CO2) 40 mmHg 35–45 mmHg
Afterwards, you notice that the blood results have come back:
Investigation Result Normal range
White cell count (WCC) 13.0 × 109/l 4–11 × 109/l
Red cell count (RCC) 3.0 × 1012/l Male 4.6–6.2 × 1012/l
Female 4.2–5.4 × 1012/l
Platelets 310 150–400 × 109/l
Troponin I 0.02 ng/ml <0.07 ng/ml
D-dimer 0.03 μg/ml <0.05 μg/ml
The chest X-ray results have also come back, and they show right lower lobe consolidation with a basal pleural effusion.
The ECG you requested shows sinus tachycardia, with T-wave inversion in aVR. You have no previous ECGs to compare this with.
The results of an urgent blood film you requested are also brought to you, which shows abnormally shaped erythrocytes, Howell–Jolly bodies and nucleated red blood cells.

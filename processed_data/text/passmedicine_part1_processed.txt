Question
 
A 67-year-old man is being treated with IV antibiotics in hospital after presenting with a cough, fever, and hypoxia. A healthcare worker on the ward finds that he is unconscious and help is called for. No peripheral pulses are felt and chest compressions are commenced. An ECG is performed which shows the following:

© Image used on license from Dr Smith, University of Minnesota

What is the best next step in his management?

Give 1 shock immediately
58%
Give 3 shocks immediately
20%
Give adrenaline 1 mg
12%
Give amiodarone 150 mg
2%
Give amiodarone 300 mg
8%

Give 1 shock immediately is correct. This ECG shows irregular deflections of varying amplitude (height), no clear p-waves, QRS complexes, or T-waves, and the rate (which can be worked out by dividing 1500 by the number of small waves between each wave) is around 1500/4 which is around 375 bpm. The ECG describes ventricular fibrillation (VF) which is a shockable rhythm (alongside ventricular tachycardia, VT). Since this patient has VF and it was not witnessed (not seen in a patient already receiving cardiac monitoring, such as in a coronary care unit), they should be given 1 shock followed by 2 minutes of CPR. Both VF and VT are managed the same initially.

Give 3 shocks immediately is incorrect. Although VF is a shockable rhythm, this would be indicated if the patient's cardiac arrest was witnessed, meaning it was seen in a patient already receiving cardiac monitoring, such as in a coronary care unit. This is not the case here as this patient was found unresponsive without any cardiac monitoring in place.

Give adrenaline 1 mg is incorrect as this is given once chest compressions have restarted after the third shock. This patient has not yet been given any shocks, therefore, this step is not yet necessary.

Give amiodarone 150 mg is incorrect as this is given once chest compressions have restarted after the fifth shock. This patient has not yet been given any shocks.

Give amiodarone 300 mg is incorrect as this is given once chest compressions have restarted after the third shock. This patient has not yet been given any shocks.

Question
 
An 87-year-old man presents to their GP with shortness of breath. He describes a sudden shortness of breath that began 4 hours previously. He is also experiencing left-sided chest pain that is worse on inspiration. The GP sends him to the hospital for a chest X-ray, querying a pulmonary embolism.

What is the most likely finding on a chest X-ray?

Kerley B lines
1%
Normal chest X-ray
4%
Pleural effusion
76%
Visible visceral pleural edge
3%
Wedge shaped opacification
15%

Pulmonary embolism - normal CXR
Important for meLess important
Normal chest x-ray is the right answer. The chest x-ray is most likely to be normal in pulmonary embolism. A chest x-ray is indicated in all patients presenting with a possible PE to rule out other pathology before a CT pulmonary angiogram. While wedge-shaped opacification can be seen, it is not a typical finding.

Visible visceral pleural edge is incorrect. This finding would be consistent with a pneumothorax, not a pulmonary embolism. Given the treating team is considering a pulmonary embolism, this is unlikely to be seen.

Kerley B lines is incorrect. This finding is consistent with pulmonary oedema, not a pulmonary embolism.

Pleural effusion is incorrect. While a pulmonary embolism can cause an exudative pleural effusion, it is not the most common finding.

Wedge shaped opacification is incorrect. While this can be seen in pulmonary embolisms, it is an uncommon finding.

Question
 
A 26-year-old woman has 3 weeks of shortness of breath and fatigue on exertion and a new skin rash over her face and nose. During this time, she has felt generally unwell and has had a dry cough and malaise. She has never smoked.

She has cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy and dark indurated plaques are noted around the eyes, nose, and cheeks.

Blood tests show:

Hb 110 g/L (115 - 160)
Platelets 260 * 109/L (150 - 400)
WBC 5.3 * 109/L (4.0 - 11.0)

Sarcoidosis
59%
Systemic lupus erythematosus

Facial rash plus lymphadenopathy think sarcoidosis
Important for meLess important
Sarcoidosis is correct in this case. This patient is young and female presenting with shortness of breath, fatigue on exertion, a facial rash and lymphadenopathy which should raise suspicion of sarcoidosis. The elevated serum calcium supports this diagnosis, as sarcoidosis can lead to hypercalcaemia due to the increased production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 by activated macrophages and granulomas. The rash described in this patient is known as lupus pernio, which describes dark indurated plaques that can involve the face and extremities.

Dermatomyositis is incorrect in this case. Although this can present with a darkened rash in the periorbital region (a heliotrope rash), this is characterised by proximal muscle weakness and tenderness due to inflammation of the muscle. This is also associated with malignancy, including ovarian, breast, and lung cancer. Besides feeling generally unwell, no other features suggestive of cancer such as haemoptysis are present. Creatine kinase is also normal in this patient, which would be elevated if she had dermatomyositis due to inflammation of the muscles.

Lung cancer is incorrect in this case. Although this may present with lymphadenopathy, cough, and shortness of breath, this patient does not smoke and has no associated features such as haemoptysis or unexplained weight loss, making this diagnosis less likely.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is incorrect in this case. Although this can present with lymphadenopathy and a facial rash, the rash on the face is generally described as malar and butterfly-shaped over the cheeks, sparing the nasolabial folds. This patient's rash is also noted around her eyes, which is not present in SLE. Patients often have associated features such as mouth ulcers and joint pain, which are not seen here.

Systemic sclerosis is incorrect in this case. This presents with hardened and sclerotic skin either over the face and distal limbs in limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, or the trunk and proximal limbs in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. This patient has no involvement of the distal limbs or trunk, and the skin changes in systemic sclerosis do not include darkening. Systemic sclerosis is also not associated with hypercalcaemia and lymphadenopathy and this patient has no other associated features such as features seen in CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, oesophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia).

Question
 
A 35-year-old woman who has a regular 28-day menstrual cycle complains of mood changes in the week before her period. She describes increasing anxiety and irritability.

Which of the following interventions is most appropriate to help reduce her pre-menstrual symptoms?

A. Combined oral contraceptive pill
B. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
C. Progesterone only pill
D. Contraceptive implant
E. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI)

Correct Answer: E

Question
 
A 59-year-old man with a past medical history of chronic kidney disease stage 4 and diverticular disease is admitted with abdominal pain. On examination, he is tender in the left iliac fossa with localised guarding. His heart rate is 112 bpm, his blood pressure is 126/82 mmHg and his temperature is 38.4ºC. A blood test is performed and shows the following:

WBC 19.2 * 109/L (4.0 - 11.0)
Urea 8.1 mmol/L (2.0 - 7.0)
Creatinine 131 µmol/L (55 - 120)
CRP 147 mg/L (< 5)

Given the likely diagnosis, which of the following is necessary before diagnostic imaging?

No treatment
21%
1L intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride
60%
1L oral water
4%
250mL intravenous Hartmann’s solution
11%
500mL intravenous 5% glucose
3%

Prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy: volume expansion with 0.9% saline
Important for meLess important
This man is likely suffering from acute diverticulitis but requires a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast to make a diagnosis. Iodine-based CT and x-ray contrast medium can cause contrast-induced nephropathy and potentially cause an acute kidney injury (AKI) on the background of this man’s chronic kidney disease (CKD). To limit the risk of this, if contrast must be given, volume expansion before and after the scan should be done. The minimum volume should be 1mL/kg per hour over 12 hours. For an average 70kg man, this is 840mL. In practice, the usual volume given is 1L before and 1L after of 0.9% sodium chloride.

Not offering treatment risks causing an AKI and in someone with stage 4 CKD, this may precipitate severe acute renal failure requiring emergency dialysis.

Oral water is not adequate for volume expansion and fluids must be given intravenously.

Although Hartmann’s solution contains enough sodium to be used in place of 0.9% sodium chloride, 250mL is too small a volume and will have no effect.

5% glucose is inappropriate for volume expansion as very little remains in the intravascular space. Additionally, 500mL is too small a volume.

Question
 
The paediatric doctor has been asked to see a woman on the postnatal ward who has a 12-hour old baby. The baby was born at 36 weeks with no complications. The midwife reports that the mother is exclusively breastfeeding but also attempting to hand express, and the latest capillary blood glucose is 0.9mmol/L. The baby is asymptomatic.

What should be done next?

Admit to neonatal unit and give glucose gel in addition to formula feeds
8%
Encourage breastfeeding
37%
Give glucose gel in addition to breastfeeding
15%
Give formula feed and repeat capillary blood glucose in 2 hours
7%
Admit to neonatal unit and start 10% dextrose infusion
33%

Neonatal hypoglycaemia: if symptomatic or very low blood glucose admit to neonatal unit and give IV 10% dextrose
Important for meLess important
The correct answer is to admit to the neonatal unit and start a 10% dextrose infusion. Capillary blood glucose of <1mmol/L is a very low glucose level and should be reviewed by the paediatric team and started on an intravenous dextrose infusion, regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not. The risk factor for hypoglycaemia here is prematurity.

Therefore all the other options are incorrect - this may be used to varying degrees in less severe, or asymptomatic, neonatal hypoglycaemia.

Question
 
A 32-year-old Sunday league rugby player presents to the emergency department with a painful knee. Upon history taking, she describes feeling a popping sensation in her right knee during the match, and upon clinical examination the knee is swollen, and the patient is unable to fully extend her knee.

Which one of the following tests is most likely to reveal the underlying diagnosis?

Ultrasound scan (US)
18%
Joint aspiration
2%
Plain film radiograph (X-ray)
13%
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
67%
HLA-B27 testing
0%

MRI is the most appropriate imaging modality to diagnose meniscal tears
Important for meLess important
Based on the patient's clinical presentation, a meniscal injury is highly likely. MRI is almost 90% sensitive at detecting lateral and medial meniscal tears. It has a higher sensitivity than the other options listed, and should be requested for all patients with suspected meniscal injury.

Also, ultrasound would prove difficult given the degree of swelling and pain that the patient is likely to be in. An X-ray would be indicated in a patient with concurrent arthritis or a long-standing history of repeated meniscal tears.

Her urine dip shows:

pH 6
Leucocytes +
Nitrates ++
Protein -
Blood ++
Ketones -
bHCG negative

What is the most appropriate management for this patient?

Prescribe a five days course of trimethoprim

Prescribe a three days course of amoxicillin

Non-pregnant women with uncomplicated lower UTI only need 3 days of antibiotics
Important for meLess important
This patient is presenting with urinary symptoms and a positive urine dip (leucocytes and nitrates positive). The blood is most likely due to her menstruation. As she is not pregnant and has no recurrent history of UTIs, she should be managed with prescription of a three days course of nitrofurantoin.

It would be inappropriate to prescribe prescribe a three days course of amoxicillin as the first-line antibiotics for UTI for non-pregnant women are trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin. If she was intolerant to these antibiotics or had previous UTIs which had not responded to these antibiotics, it would be worth considering amoxicillin.

There is no instance when a prescription of a five days course of trimethoprim would be advised for management of a UTI. Patients are typically given 3 or 7-day courses of antibiotics with this condition.

Prescription a seven days course of nitrofurantoin should be offered for male patients or patients who are catheterised. In pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, they should be given 7 days of nitrofurantoin, to reduce the risk of the infection leading to pyelonephritis. As this patient is not pregnant, male, or catheterised, it is an incorrect answer.

Prescription of a seven days course of trimethoprim is an alternative first-line antibiotic option for male patients or patients who are catheterised.

Question
 
A 72-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of reduced sensation in his lower limbs that has been progressively worsening over the last 3 months. He feels increasingly unsteady on his feet but is otherwise well.

On examination, vibration and pinprick sensation are reduced symmetrically and he has a wide-based ataxic gait. His ankle reflexes are absent however his knee reflexes are brisk.

His past medical history includes hypertension, managed with ramipril, and gastric cancer, which was treated with a sub-total gastrectomy 4 years ago. He has a body mass index of 29.2kg/m² and drinks 10 units of alcohol per week.

What is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?

Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord
51%
Diabetes mellitus
16%
Multiple sclerosis
5%
Cerebellar malignancy
10%
Alcoholic polyneuropathy
18%

Gastrectomy may result in vitamin B12 deficiency
Important for meLess important
Loss of vibration sense, ataxia and absent ankle reflexes are suggestive of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord stemming from B12 deficiency. B12 deficiency is a known complication of total and sub-total gastrectomy, a consequence of removing of the intrinsic factor secreting cells that reside in the fundus and body of the stomach.

Whilst the patient is overweight, there are no other features that suggest diabetes mellitus might be responsible. His alcohol intake is moderate. There are no features suggestive of malignancy whilst multiple sclerosis would be unusual in an older man.

Question
 
A 5-week-old boy is brought into the GP by his mother with diarrhoea and vomiting for the past 4 days. He also has a new rash that is irritating him and has developed a runny nose. There is no history of any weight loss, pyrexia, or other family members being unwell.

On further questioning, she reports that she has tried to wean him from breast to bottle this week as she is going away with work in 3 weeks time and is anxious about him not feeding well if there is a sudden change. The GP suspects that the infant may have cow's milk protein intolerance.

What is the next most appropriate feed to trial in this infant?

Amino acid based formula
7%
Extensively hydrolysed formula
70%
High-protein formula
1%
Lactose free formula
17%
Soy based formula
5%

If a formula-fed baby is suspected of having mild-moderate cow's milk protein intolerance then a extensive hydrolysed formula should be tried
Important for meLess important
This infant is suspected to have a mild-moderate cow's milk protein intolerance - he is having frequent regurgitations, diarrhoea, and has recently been swapped to a formula feed. If he had more severe features, such as failure to thrive, severe atopic dermatitis, or laryngo-oedema: this would be suggestive of severe cow's milk protein intolerance. With the GP's suspicion, he should be trialled on an extensively hydrolysed formula. This formula is tolerated by 90% of infants with cow's milk protein intolerance. In this formula, the proteins that trigger allergy are hydrolysed into peptides which make them less allergenic.

Amino acid-based formula is appropriate for infants with severe cow's milk protein intolerance. This formula is less palatable, however, it is appropriate for those with severe intolerance as it is composed of free amino acids only.

High protein formula has been used to manage pre-term infants. This is becoming an increasingly specialised use as there are increasing studies showing that high-protein feed (even in prematurity) is associated with increased long-term obesity risk.

Lactose-free formula would be appropriate if the child was considered to be lactose intolerant. The features pointing towards cow's milk protein intolerance are the rash and runny nose. Infants with lactose intolerance will usually have GI symptoms only.

Soy based formula is not typically recommended for infants due to its high phyto-oestrogen content which could potentially give hormonal side effects.

Question
 
A 65-year-old man attends a stroke clinic following a transient ischaemic attack.

On examination, he has a diastolic murmur loudest over the apex. His pulse rate is 90 bpm and irregular, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. An ECG shows an irregular ventricular rate and absent P waves.

What is the most likely cause of the murmur?

Aortic regurgitation
10%
Left atrial myxoma
6%
Mitral regurgitation
17%
Mitral stenosis
65%
Tricuspid stenosis
2%

Diastolic murmur + AF → ?mitral stenosis
Important for meLess important
Mitral stenosis is associated with a mid-diastolic murmur loudest over the apex and accentuated with the patient in a left lateral position. It commonly causes atrial fibrillation (secondary to left atrial enlargement) which may result in embolic sequelae (e.g. stroke, TIA, mesenteric ischaemia).

Aortic regurgitation also causes a diastolic murmur (specifically, early diastolic) but is loudest over the aortic area and is less commonly associated with AF.

Left atrial myxoma can imitate the murmur of mitral stenosis (tumour ‘plop’) and in fact may cause embolic sequelae and AF, however, it is far rarer than mitral stenosis.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is associated with a pansystolic murmur over the apex radiating to the axilla. MR can result in dyspnoea, fatigue and palpitations (depending on the severity of the incompetence). Like mitral stenosis, MR can cause AF, therefore the differentiating feature is the timing of the murmur (diastolic in mitral stenosis, systolic in MR).

Tricuspid regurgitation causes a systolic murmur over the tricuspid area. It is exceptionally rare in developed countries and is most often caused by rheumatic fever or carcinoid syndrome. It is not commonly associated with AF or embolic sequelae.

Question
 
A 20-year-old man presents with nausea and vomiting, headache, muscle cramps and anorexia. His past medical history is notable for schizophrenia however this is well controlled in the community with risperidone. Clinical examination is unremarkable and the patient does not appear dehydrated. On examination the heart rate was 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 /minute, temperature: 37.1 ºC and blood pressure 138/91 mmHg. Initial tests are ordered in the emergency department as follows:

Hb 131 g/l
WBC 6 * 109/l

Na+ 120 mmol/l
K+ 3.9 mmol/l
Urea 3.1 mmol/l
Creatinine 82 µmol/l
Chlorine 93 mmol/l
CRP <5 mg/l

capillary blood glucose 3.5 mmol/l

Which additional test is likely to point to the diagnoses?

Urinary protein
4%
Urine osmolality
68%
Liver function tests
6%
Short synacthen
19%
Renal ultrasound
2%

The observations and blood results make an infective cause of the man's symptoms unlikely. Another diagnoses to be thinking of in this presentation might be diabetic ketoacidosis but he is not noted to be diabetic, is not dehydrated and the blood sugar is on the low side of normal (because the patient is not currently eating much). The electrolytes show a low sodium in the context of a patient who is not dehydrated and does not have oedema. The next important assessment would be the osmolality of the urine. If this was > 100 mmol/kg, this would suggest the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). A clue for the cause is given in the question, the patient is a schizophrenic taking risperidone. Although this is a rare cause of SIADH compared to selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), it is listed in the BNF as a recognised side effect. The management would involve a psychiatry referral in order to trial an alternative drug with close monitoring.

LFTs, urinary protein or a renal ultrasound scan might have been appropriate if the patient had oedema to rule out renal failure or liver failure. A short synacthen test might have been indicated at a later stage in an Addisonian patient but this is unlikely here given the normal serum K+ and the normotensive, non-dehydrated clinical state.

Question
 
An 86-year-old gentleman on the hepatobiliary ward has advanced pancreatic cancer. He wishes for his treatments to be stopped, and to be looked after by his daughter at home. His consultant asks the FY2 to conduct a capacity assessment, and he is deemed to have capacity relating to this decision.

Which of the following ways is most appropriate to ensure his wishes are met?

Complete 'Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR)' paperwork
12%
Repeat capacity assessment by psychiatrist
2%
Detain under the Mental Health Act (MHA) pending psychiatric review
0%
Complete 'advanced request for refusal of treatment' paperwork
81%
Enquire as to whether he has a lasting power of attorney (LPA)
5%

'Advanced requests for refusal of treatment' can be sought by patients who wish to refuse treatment. DNACPR refers specifically to advanced refusal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
Important for meLess important
An advanced request for refusal of treatment is the most appropriate method fo ensuring the wishes of this patient are met. As he has capacity, this option acknowledges that he is of sound mind to make a decision - regardless of whether it is in his best interests or not.

A repeat capacity assessment would not be necessary, unless the circumstances surrounding the patient's ability to understand, retain, weigh up and communicate his decision regarding his treatment were suspected to have changed. It would be unnecessary to request a psychiatrist to conduct a capacity assessment - these can be performed by trained members of staff and not necessarily psychiatrists.

Detention under the MHA would be inappropriate as there are no grounds for its use. Similarly, exploring whether the patient has an LPA is not the single best step forward as the decisions made by LPAs can only be executed when a patient is considered to not have capacity - which is not the case for this patient.

DNACPR refers specifically and solely to the advanced refusal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

A 67-year-old male presents with severe lower back pain that radiates down one of his legs. There is no history of injury though he does a manual job. On examination, he has reduced perianal sensation and reduced anal tone.

With regards to this patient's diagnosis, which of the following would represent a late sign and indicate potentially irreversible damage?

Positive sciatic stretch test
2%
Reduced perianal sensation
6%
Tingling of his right leg
1%
Urinary incontinence
70%
Reduced anal tone
21%

Cauda equina syndrome classically presents with lower back pain, sciatica, reduced perianal sensation. Late signs include urinary incontinence
Important for meLess important
Urinary incontinence is a late sign of cauda equina and is associated with poor outcomes - ie irreversible damage.

A positive sciatic stretch test just tells you that the patient has some irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve. It does not indicate spinal cord compression.

Reduced perianal sensation is certainly a red flag but usually appears earlier than urinary incontinence.

Tingling of one leg can be caused by sciatic nerve irritation but isn't a specific sign of cauda equina, especially if unilateral.

Anal tone should be assessed but studies show it has low sensitivity and specificity for cauda equina syndrome.

Question
 
A 32-year-old man has been admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring after an emergency laparotomy for a sigmoid perforation.

On admission to the unit, he was hypertensive and the mean arterial pressure obtained from the arterial line was 122 mmHg. One hour later, the nurse alerts you that his blood pressure had acutely dropped and was now 57 mmHg. She took a non-invasive blood pressure from the other arm, which showed a higher pressure of 78 mmHg. The arterial line is flushing and aspirating freely.

On examination, he has translucent looking, thin skin. He has become tachycardic and is grimacing in pain. His oxygenation and ventilation have not changed. A 12-lead ECG shows widespread ST-depression, but a troponin-T taken at the time was normal. On attempting to examine his neurological system, you note hypermobility of the small joints, but the rest of the neurological examination was normal for a sedated patient. The calves appear normal.

A portable chest X-ray was conducted, which showed a widened mediastinum.

The intensive care consultant feels that computerised tomography (CT) would be unsuitable for this patient as he is too unstable.

Question
 
A 45-year-old woman presents to the GP with a new rash on her face. On examination, there is a raised purple lesion covering the nose, cheeks and lips. At first, this was diagnosed as rosacea however it has rapidly progressed. The GP also notes axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. On further questioning, she notes some fatigue as well as some dyspnoea over the last 6 months. She has smoked 10 cigarettes a day for the last 8 months and drinks 10 units of alcohol a week.

Given the most likely diagnosis, which of the following is associated with her condition?

Asbestos exposure
3%
Foreign travel
6%
Rheumatoid nodules
18%
Raised serum calcium
55%
Finger clubbing
19%

Facial rash plus lymphadenopathy think sarcoidosis
Important for meLess important
This question is asking about a woman presenting with facial rash, lymphadenopathy, dyspnoea and fatigue. If we presume from the description the facial rash is fitting with lupus pernio, this presentation typically matches sarcoidosis.

Asbestos exposure is not associated with sarcoidosis, it is more associated with asbestosis or conditions such as mesothelioma. These do not present in this way.

A history of foreign travel is more associated with tuberculosis than sarcoidosis.

Rheumatoid nodules would be present in cases of rheumatoid arthritis. This would present with bilateral symmetrical joint pain as well as similar constitutional symptoms.

Finger clubbing could be associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. While this is a cause of dyspnoea and fatigue, it would not cause her rash or lymphadenopathy. Other conditions can include lung cancer which again would present differently.

What is the appropriate management for this patient?

Reassurance
13%
Refer to physiotherapy
10%
Refer urgently to the paediatrician
64%
Request a shoulder X-ray
7%
Review in 2 months
6%

Hand preference before 12 months is abnormal - it could be an indicator of cerebral palsy
Important for meLess important
Refer to the paediatrician is correct. This boy is presenting with early hand preference which points toward cerebral palsy causing weakness to the left side of the body.

Reassurance is incorrect. Hand preference before the age of 12 months is abnormal and needs to be investigated.

Refer to physiotherapy is incorrect. This boy needs to be investigated for cerebral palsy. Although physiotherapy is an integral part of managing cerebral palsy, a referral now is inappropriate as a proper diagnosis has not been made yet.

Request a shoulder X-ray is incorrect. This boy's main issue is early hand preference; there is no mention of trauma, and the history of shoulder dystocia is irrelevant here as it usually causes Erb's palsy where the arm hangs limply from the shoulder with flexion of the wrist and fingers due to weakness of muscles innervated by cervical roots C5 and C6.

Review in 2 months is incorrect. There is no point in delaying investigations given the differential diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Reviewing this boy in 2 months would not aid the diagnosis.

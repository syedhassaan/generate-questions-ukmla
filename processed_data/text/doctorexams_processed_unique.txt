Question

What is the difference between hypertrophy and hyperplasia? Give some examples for each.

Correct Answer: 

: Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of an organ due to an increase in cell size but without an increase in cell numbers. Hyperplasia, on the other hand, is an increase in the size of an organ by an increase in the total cell number. The above processes could be either a physiological or a pathological response. The causes for physiological hypertrophy are muscular hypertrophy seen in athletes, and the breast and uterine hypertrophy which occurs in pregnancy. The causes for pathological hypertrophy include cardiomyopathy and congenital muscular dystrophy. Physiological hyperplasia occurs in the thyroid during puberty and pregnancy. Pathological hyperplasia is seen in Graves’ disease and in the endometrium of the uterus which is associated with prolonged use of oestrogen.

Question

What is your understanding of the shoulder joint and its pathologies?

Correct Answer: 

The shoulder joint (Gleno-humeral joint) is a typical synovial joint of the ball and socket variety. Since there is a 4 to 1 disproportion between the large round head of the humerus and the small shallow glenoid cavity, the joint is totally reliant on soft tissue structures for both static and dynamic stability. The capsule is attached around the glenoid cavity and extends onto the base of the corocoid process superiorly to include the biceps attachment (long head). The two major bursae of the shoulder joint are: subacromial (subdeltoid) and subscapular. The subacromial bursa does not normally communicate with the synovial cavity (only communicates if there is tear in the supraspinatus tendon) while the subscapular bursa normally communicates with the synovial cavity.
In painful arc syndrome, there is pain on abduction between 45-160 degrees (middle 1/3 rd of the arc), but the extremes of movements are painless. Abduction is lost in patients with complete tear to the supraspinatus tendon (rotator cuff tear). The patient is unable to initiate abduction of the shoulder because the supraspinatus and the deltoid help the early phase of abduction; supraspinatus causes the first 10-15 degrees of abduction followed by deltoid which helps in further 90-100 degrees of abduction. Anterior dislocation is the commonest type of shoulder dislocation (in contrast to posterior type in the hip joint). Axillary nerve is usually affected in such type of injuries since it lies in contact with the surgical neck of the humerus, just below the capsule of the joint. It supplies the joint, the deltoid and teres minor muscles, and the cutaneous branch (upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm) supplies the upper outer aspect of the arm. Dislocations thus cause loss of sensation over this area as well as loss of shoulder abduction (deltoid muscle wasting is seen with long-term axillary nerve injuries). Radial nerve is commonly injured in fractures of the mid-shaft of humerus, as the nerve runs through the radial (spiral) grove.

Question

What is the difference between a cell cycle and cell differentiation?

Correct Answer: 

A cell cycle describes the phases through which the cell progresses before cell division. Cell differentiation is a term that describes the development of a cell with a specialised function that distinguishes it from its parent cell. This occurs as a result of altered expression of selective genes and proteins resulting in the formation of such a cell with a specific function.

Question

What do you understand by the term ‘apoptosis’?

Correct Answer: 

Apoptosis is defined as programmed cell death. This is a normal process occurring during the physiological part of growth and development. It is also a mechanism for removal of cells that contain abnormal DNA. In apoptosis, there is loss of plasma membrane asymmetry and attachment, condensation of the cytoplasm and nucleus, inter-nucleosomal cleavage of DNA (digested into smaller fragments), and the cell eventually fragments into ‘apoptotic bodies’. Apoptosis is an essential part of tissue homeostasis. The constant production of cells by mitosis, and removed by apoptosis, allows a continuous cell turnover that is able to cope with environmental changes. Apoptosis, for example, occurs in the endometrium of the uterus as a natural part of the menstural cycle when levels of hormones fall. It is also responsible for the degeneration of the thymus after childhood.

Question

What is the difference between apoptosis and necrosis?

Correct Answer: 

Apotosis is programmed cell death, a normal process which occurs during the physiological part of growth and development. It is also a mechanism for removal of cells that contain abnormal DNA. Necrosis is cell death occurring as a result of cell injury or exposure to cytotoxic agents. It is therefore pathological and plays no part in normal tissue homeostasis. Necrosis is generally associated with an inflammatory reaction which is not seen in apoptosis. Apoptosis results in the formation of ‘apoptotic bodies’ which are subsequently removed by phagocytes; this process is not associated with the inflammation seen in necrosis.

Question

What is the role of apoptosis during embryological development?

Correct Answer: 

Three types of apoptosis are seen during embryological development and this has important significance: (i) Morphogenic apoptosis occurs when there is structural change in the tissue or organ. This is seen in during cell death of the skin separating fingers, and cell death in the dorsal neural tube leading to tube closure; (ii) Histogenic apoptosis occurs when the tissue or organ undergo differentiation. This occurs in the Mullerian/Wolffian ducts, under hormonal influence, leading to the development of the female/male genital tracts respectively; (iii) Phylogenetic apoptosis occurs when the embryological vestigeal structures are removed, as occurs in the pronephros.

Question

What are the processes of wound healing?

Correct Answer: 

Wound healing is a sequential cascade of overlapping processes which requires the co-ordinated completion of a variety of cellular activities following complex initiating cellular events that include phagocytosis, chemotaxis, mitogenesis, collagen synthesis, and the synthesis of other matrix components. There are four different stages in acute wound healing. They are haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling and scar formation.

Question

Briefly describe each of the phases of wound healing?

Correct Answer: 

Extravasation of blood into a wound causes constriction of nearby vessel walls and initiates the coagulation cascade leading to clot formation and platelet aggregation. The platelets also secrete several growth factors such as PDGF, IGF-1, EGF and TGF-β which initiate the wound healing cascade by attracting and activating fibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages.
Haemostasis is followed by the inflammatory phase. Within 24 to 48 hours of injury, the wound is infiltrated with neutrophils. They phagocytose bacteria and other foreign particles by releasing degrading enzymes. The neutrophil activity usually ceases within a few days of wounding after any contaminating bacteria have been cleared. Macrophages (phenotypic variation of monocytes) arrive at the wound site between 48-72 hours. They also function as phagocytic cells as well as producing growth factors responsible for the production and proliferation of extracellular matrix, proliferation of fibroblasts, and stimulating angiogenesis. They release proteolytic enzymes, such as collagenase, which help to debride the wound.
The proliferative phase starts at approximately day three and lasts after wounding for 2 to 4 weeks. This phase is characterised by migration of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, and formation of granulation tissue. With progression of the proliferative phase, the provisional fibrin/fibronectin matrix is replaced by newly formed granulation tissue. Epithelialisation (regeneration) of the wound represents the final stage of the proliferative phase.
The final phase is the remodelling phase and maturation of the resulting scar. The remodelling phase is initiated concurrently with the development of granulation tissue, and continues over prolonged periods of time. There is continuous collagen synthesis and breakdown as the extracelluar matrix is constantly remodelled, equilibrating to a steady state approximately 21 days after wounding. Ultimately the granulation tissue scaffolding evolves into an avascular scar which is composed of largely inactive, spindle-shaped fibroblasts, dense collagen, fragments of elastic tissue, and other ECM components.

Question

What are the different types of wound healing and describe primary wound healing?

Correct Answer: 

There are four general types of wound healing: (i) primary (ii) delayed primary (iii) secondary and (iv) healing of superficial wounds. Primary healing, also called healing by first intention, occurs when a wound is closed within 12-24 hours of its creation. This is the type of healing seen in a clean surgical incision or a clean laceration. The wound edges are approximated directly using sutures, tissue glue, tapes or a mechanical device such as staples. The incision causes only focal disruption of epithelial basement membrane continuity, and death of a relatively few epithelial and connective tissue cells. As a result, the healing of the wound is usually complete.
Delayed primary healing occurs in a contaminated or poorly delineated wound that is closed after a few days after being left open to prevent infection. This type of healing is preferred in wounds due to bites or abdominal wounds after peritoneal soiling. The skin and subcutaneous tissues are left unapposed (sutures may be put in place but not tied) and closure is performed after the normal host defences are allowed to debride the wound. The wound edges may even be approximated after a delay of several days.

Question

What is secondary wound healing and in which circumstances would you prefer such healing?

Correct Answer: 

Secondary healing, also called as healing by second intention, is seen in a wound which is left open to granulate and heal on its own. This is usually done to wounds with extensive soft tissue loss as seen in major trauma or after some surgical procedures such as a laparostomy wound. Since regeneration of epithelial cells alone cannot restore the original architecture, in secondary healing, the wound closes by both wound contraction and epithelialization. Myofibroblasts play a key role in this type of healing leading to wound contracture. Healing by secondary intention is slower, may lead to contractures and functional restriction.

Question

What is a chronic wound and what causes a chronic wound?

Correct Answer: 

A chronic wound is defined as one in which the normal process of healing is disrupted at one or more points in the phases of haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, or remodelling. In the majority of chronic wounds, the healing process is considered being ‘stuck’ in the inflammatory or proliferative phases. Since growth factors, cytokines, proteases, and cellular and extracellular elements all play important roles in different stages of the healing process, alterations in one or more of these components could account for the impaired healing observed in chronic wounds. In addition, oxidative damage by free radicals or condition specific factors such as neuropathy in diabetes or ischemia in peripheral vascular disease may lead to the non-healing nature of chronic wounds.

Question

Define Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome?

Correct Answer: 

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a generalised inflammatory response by the body resulting from a variety of clinical insults such as shock, trauma, burns, infection (bacterial, viral, fungal), pancreatitis, and tissue ischaemia. The patient may have one or more of the following features:
Temperature > 38 o C or < 36o C
Heart rate >90 beats/min
Respiratory rate >20 or PaCo2 < 4.3 kpa
WCC > 12, 000 or < 4,000 x 109/L

Question

What is sepsis and what is the commonest cause of sepsis?

Correct Answer: 

Sepsis is defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with documented infection, i.e. the systemic response to an infection of some kind. Bacterial infection is the commonest cause of sepsis. Although Gram negative bacteria were considered to the major cause of sepsis earlier, it has been recognised that Gram positive bacteria account for the same percentage of cases as Gram negative bacteria. Together they account for more than 95 % of cases of sepsis; the rest being fungal or viral. Septic shock is SIRS with documented infection, but also including hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation, and abnormal or inadequate organ perfusion/hypoperfusion.

Question

What do you know about cytokines, and what is their role in the aetiology of SIRS and sepsis?

Correct Answer: 

Cytokines are low molecular weight proteins. They are very potent with a short half-life, and are the local factors involved in the inflammatory and immune responses. They act via complex and interactive pathways, with positive feed-back and amplification, similar to the complement cascade. Cytokines are responsible for the inflammatory response observed in SIRS and sepsis. Initially, a local inflammatory response is triggered by the cytokines leading to the induction and release of neutrophils and macrophages. Then the inflammatory response becomes progressively more systemic and uncontrolled, leading to an overwhelming response involving IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 and TNF-α . The cytokines are responsible for a whole host of local and systemic effects, including vasodilatation, increased capillary permeability, impaired oxygen utilization and myocardial depression.

Question

How would you recognise a septic patient?

Correct Answer: 

A septic patient would appear generally unwell. In the early stages, the patient may present with SIRS, tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnoea (maybe with accompanying hypoxia) with warm bounding peripheral pulses as a result of peripheral vasodilatation. This is related to the hyperdynamic circulation associated with decreased systemic vascular resistance and peripheral vasodilation, and an increased cardiac output. This type of shock was previously referred to as ‘hot shock’ since this type of clinical picture is in contrast to the decreased cardiac output and peripheral vasoconstriction (leading to cold peripheries) observed in other types of shock. In addition, hyperthermia may be seen, or more rarely, and a poor prognostic sign, hypothermia. In the later stages of septic shock, the patient may be hypotensive with peripheral vasoconstriction, especially if the patient is hypovolaemic or myocardial function is compromised. Other pertinent clinical signs and symptoms include oliguria, drowsiness and confusion.

Question

What investigations would you do in a patient with suspected septic shock and what might these results show?

Correct Answer: 

I would ask for a full blood count, coagulation screen, urea and electrolyte balance, liver function tests, arterial blood gas analysis and request a chest X-ray if the patient in manifesting any evidence of respiratory compromise or early symptoms of ARDS. Typically a full blood count would show a high WCC, with neutrophilia, although there might be neutropenia in overwhelming sepsis. The platelet count may be decreased. The coagulation screen may reveal an increased INR and other decreased clotting factors, due to septic coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation, although in the late stages of septic shock an altered coagulation picture might be due to hepatic involvement (dysfunction). Urea and electrolyte results may show varying degrees of renal impairment, or indicate an element of dehydration if urea and sodium are raised disproportionately compared to the creatinine. Arterial blood gas analysis may reveal a metabolic acidosis with or without compensatory respiratory alkalosis (due to hyperventilation leading to a reduced PCO2). The lactic acid levels may be elevated due to tissue hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism. A chest X-ray may reveal some haziness in the lung fields (mostly bilaterally) due to the inflammatory response or frank signs of pulmonary oedema. In the later stages, there may be associated pleural effusion and consolidation of one or more lung fields due to pneumonia.

Question

What is the difference between tissue ischaemia and tissue infarction?

Correct Answer: 

Ischaemia is the reduction of blood supply to an organ or tissue so that the metabolic demands of the tissue and their oxygen requirements are not met but there is sufficient supply to prevent infarction. Infarction results from total cessation of blood supply (extreme ischaemia) resulting in tissue necrosis.

Question

What are the causes of tissue ischaemia?

Correct Answer: 

This can be classified based on the aetiology into an arterial, capillary or a venous cause. The causes for ischaemia due to arterial compromise include thrombosis, atheroma and embolus. The causes for capillary obstruction leading to ischaemia include external pressure leading to pressure ulcers, digital capillary damage leading to frostbite, vasculitis from meningococcal septicaemia, sickle cell disease and malaria (cerebral capillaries). The causes for venous ischaemia include: strangulated hernia, mesentric thrombosis, volvulus, intussusception, and thrombosis of the intracranial venous spaces (e.g., longitudinal sinus thrombosis and cavernous sinus thrombosis).

Question

What is an embolus?

Correct Answer: 

An embolus is an abnormal mass of undissolved material that is carried in the bloodstream from one site to another. If the embolus impacts in an organ such as the lung it could lead to ischaemia or infarction. About 95% of all emboli are thrombi or a mixture of thrombus and clot. An embolus may also result from a tumour (usually carcinoma), fat or bone marrow from fractured long bones or as a result of an orthopaedic procedure such as intra-medullary nailing, atheromatous material from ruptured plaques (commonly affecting the mesenteric vessels from aortic plaques), air from opened neck veins from trauma or peritoneal insufflation, nitrogen in Caisson disease, amniotic fluid during child-birth, parasites or other organisms in the blood stream, and foreign body due to any cause.

Question

What is an amyloid?

Correct Answer: 

An amyloid is the deposition of a group of pathological proteins within affected tissues. It may be local or systemic, and interferes with the structure and function of the affected tissue or organ, usually by accumulating in the basement membrane of the tissues concerned. They can be classified into local and systemic amyloidosis.

Question

What are the differences between local and systemic amyloidosis?

Correct Answer: 

Local amyloid deposits can occur in any particular organ. It may result from tumours which produce peptide hormones such as medullary carcinoma of the thyroid which affects the calcitonin-producing C cells. It is also seen in the cerebrum of people affected by Alzheimer’s disease manifesting as senile plaques and deposits within the cerebral arteries.
Systemic amyloidosis involves the deposition of amyloid in various organs such as the spleen, liver and heart, although any organ could be affected. It results in enlargement of the affected organ and organ failure ensues as the tissue hardens. The cause for systemic amyloidosis are: (i) secondary (due to chronic inflammatory disease processes such as bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis and TB); (ii) hereditary (familial Mediterranean fever and Portuguese nephropathy); (iii) haemodialysis- related (due to deposition of ß2 microglobulin); (iv) myeloma- related (produced by myelomas) and (v) senile amyloidosis (usually affects the heart and arterial system in the elderly although it is rarely symptomatic).

Question

Describe the structure of an amyloid?

Correct Answer: 

Amyloids, which form characteristic ß pleated sheets, have a fibrillar ultrastructure and is made up of proteins such as serum amyloid proteins A and B, peptide hormones, and immunoglobulin light chains. The type of protein involved varies with the aetiology: amyloid protein A is found in secondary amyloidosis due to inflammatory conditions (AA amyloid) and AL amyloid, derived from the excessive amount of light- chain monoclonal immunoglobulins, found in myeloma-related amyloidosis.

Question

What signs or symptoms would lead you to a suspicion or diagnosis of amyloidosis? How would you diagnose it?

Correct Answer: 

A patient with amyloidosis may present with carpal tunnel syndrome, organomegaly (especially hepato-spleenomegaly), renal failure, cardiac failure, macroglossia, and purpura. If the patient has any risk factors for amyloidosis (e.g., chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or myeloma), and have one or more of the above features, then a diagnosis of amyloidosis need to be considered. Rectal biopsy is a very useful investigation in the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Amyloid has a characteristic apple-green birefringence on Congo red staining. Addition of iodine alone stains mahogany brown; if dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid is added, it turns blue-violet. A diagnosis of amyloidosis can also be made from biopsies of the affected organ and demonstrating the characteristic ß pleated sheets under the electron microscope. It may also be possible to determine precisely where the amyloid originated from using special staining techniques.

Question

What are two most common types of excessive scarring and what are their causes?

Correct Answer: 

The two most common forms of abnormal scars are the hypertrophic scars and keloids. They are forms of excessive healing resulting from overproduction of all components of the healing process including fibroblasts, collagen, elastin and proteoglycans.

Question

What are the differences between hypertrophic scars and keloids?

Correct Answer: 

There are a number of differences between hypertrophic scars and keloids:
Hypertrophic scars usually develops within weeks after injury but keloids can develop up to one year later
Hypertrophic scars are usually seen in the flexor surfaces while keloids have a predilection for the sternum, shoulder and earlobes
Hypertrophic scars do not extend beyond the margins of the origin wound (scar) whilst keloids are a form of benign dermo-proliferative tumours which extend well beyond the margins of the original wound. In predisposed people, even a trivial injury can predispose to the formation of a keloid

Question

What factors predispose to the formation of hypertrophic scars and keloids?

Correct Answer: 

The incidence of HTS is highest in wounds crossing tension lines, areas of increased skin tension and movement, deep dermal burns and wounds that have been left to heal by secondary intention. In addition, factors causing local inflammation such as persistent irritation, haematoma, infection, wound dehiscence and foreign bodies also predispose to a HTS. Keloids, however, do not have a specific aetiological factor although there is an almost certain genetic predisposition and is more common in dark skinned races. HTS may subside with time and respond to conservative treatment. However, no treatment is proven to be useful in the management of keloids.

Question

What is adult respiratory distress syndrome?

Correct Answer: 

Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute, diffuse inflammatory process resulting from direct or indirect pulmonary injury. It is also defined as non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema with a normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and characterized by stiff lungs, respiratory hypoxia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray. ARDS is characterised by refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 <8 kPa at FiO2 >0.4), alveolar inflammation and oedema, reduced total compliance (<30 ml/cm water) and a PaO2 (in mmHg)/FiO2 ratio of <200 (normal is approximately 500). Pulmonary fibrosis in the later stages of the disease leads to a decrease in the functional residual capacity, further decrease in lung compliance, and an increase in the shunt effect. Pulmonary signs are often minimal or non-specific, the patient simply being breathless, progressively tachypnoeic, hypoxic and then cyanotic. Chest X-ray may be normal in the early stages but later shows bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltration.

Question

What are the causes for adult respiratory distress syndrome?

Correct Answer: 

Adult respiratory distress syndrome is most commonly seen in patients with sepsis but can also occur after trauma, burns, inhalation injuries, shock and pancreatitis. In post-operative surgical patients, abdominal sepsis or central line sepsis should be considered.

Question

Briefly describe the pathophysiology of adult respiratory distress syndrome?

Correct Answer: 

Indirect or direct lung injury initiates an abnormal behaviour and movement of neutrophils, platelets and macrophages. Neutrophils and platelets attach to capillary endothelium causing capillary leakage. This leads to oedema of lung tissue and movement of neutrophils and erythrocytes into the lung parenchyma. Lung lymph flow is increased with thickening of the alveolar-capillary membrane. This results in impaired oxygen diffusion and reduced lung compliance as the alveolus is surrounded by fluid. In addition, some of the fluid in the pulmonary parenchyma may leak into the alveoli, giving the characteristic appearance of a hyaline membrane.

Question

Briefly describe the principles of managing adult respiratory distress syndrome?

Correct Answer: 

Treatment, in addition to eliminating the precipitating aetiology, involves ventilating the patient in intensive care. Some general and systemic measures include: (i) providing respiratory support (mechanical ventilation, PEEP, permissive hypercapnoea, prevent barotrauma, and inverse ratio ventilation to help alveolar recruitment); (ii) avoidance of pulmonary oedema by restricting fluid and diuretics; (iii) keeping the tidal volume low (approximately 6 mls/kg); (iv) maintaining a low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (high exacerbates pulmonary oedema); (v) nursing the patient in prone position to redirect blood flow to minimise shunting; (vi) physiotherapy (although not useful in the early stages but effective in the later stages to remove secretions); (vii) inhaled nitric oxide to improve ventilation-perfusion ratio with pulmonary vasodilation; (viii) aerosolised surfactant and prostocycline has also been used but the evidence is limited. Despite appropriate treatment, the mortality of this condition is as high as 50-70%.

Question

Briefly describe your understanding of gangrene and its common forms.

Correct Answer: 

Gangrene implies death with putrefaction of macroscopic portions of tissue. A gangrenous part lacks arterial pulsation, venous return, sensation, warmth and function. The two commonest forms of gangrene are: Dry gangrene and wet gangrene. Dry gangrene occurs when the tissues are desiccated by gradual slowing of the bloodstream; it is typically the result of atherosclerosis and not related to infection. Moist gangrene occurs when venous as well as arterial obstruction is present, when the artery is suddenly occluded, as by a ligature or embolus, and in diabetes. In moist gangrene, superseded infection and putrefaction are more likely, the affected part becomes swollen and discoloured, and the epidermis may be raised in blebs. Diabetic gangrene (usually dry to start with but may become wet gangrene due to superseded infection) is due to three factors: trophic changes resulting from peripheral neuritis; atheroma of the small arteries resulting in ischemia and; excess sugar lowering the resistance to infection. Diabetic gangrene of the toes can occur in the presence of palpable peripheral pulses (absence implies associated major arterial disease).
The other important form of gangrene is known as gas gangrene. Clostridium perfringens, widely found in nature, particularly soil and faeces, is the cause of gas gangrene in about 80 percent of cases. Wound infections in gas gangrene are associated with severe local wound pain and crepitus; gas in the tissues may be noted on plain radiographs. Synergistic spreading gangrene (necrotising fasciitis; Synonyms: Meleney’s gangrene for abdominal wall infections and Fournier’s gangrene for scrotal infections) is usually caused by a mixed pattern of organisms – coliforms, staphylococci, Bacteriodes spp., anaerobic streptococci, and pepto-streptococci. In synergistic spreading gangrene, the extent of subdermal spread of gangrene is always much more extensive than at first apparent. Surgical debridement, wide excision and laying open of the affected tissue, combined with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and aggressive circulatory support may be necessary to save life; skin grafting, after resolution of acute symptoms, may be needed to cover the large, excised areas. Meleney’s gangrene still carries 30 - 40% mortality.

Question

What do you know about bone infection (osteomyelitis) in children?

Correct Answer: 

Acute osteomyelitis in children is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection. The other important causative organisms include Streptococcus pyogenes or pneumoniae, E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella, Proteus, Pseudomonas and anerobes. It may be acquired by the haematogenous route, direct skin puncture following injury or from infection from adjacent soft tissues. It usually commences in the metaphyseal region of long bones since in children the terminal branches of the nutrient artery of the shaft are end arteries and are subject to pathological phenomena such as infection, embolism and infarction. As the bacteria multiply, an acute inflammatory response is mounted with vascular engorgement, oedema and polymorphonuclear cell aggregation. Tissue cell death occurs secondary to ischemia from both venous and arterial obstruction. The resultant abscess gradually enlarges and may spread to the subperiosteal space, to the medulla, and to the joint itself through vessels which cross the growth plate and epiphyseal cartilage. If the joint is affected, the child may refuse to walk or to move the affected limb.
Radiological appearances in osteomyelitis are normal in the early stages. Sequestrum and involucrum are features of chronic osteomyelitis (sequestrum is a necrotic nidus of bone within a focus of chronic osteomyelitis while an involucrum is a cloak of new bone produced by the periosteum around the infection). The growth disturbance which may follow infection during infancy depends upon the volume of the growth plate affected, the location of the destructive process, and how badly the epiphysis and its cartilage canal systems are invaded and destroyed. This could either lead to overgrowth of the limb due to stimulation of the growth plate or deformity due to growth plate damage.

Question

What is your understanding of shock and briefly explain the types.

Correct Answer: 

Shock is defined as inadequate organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation. The common types of shock are: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic and obstructive. True neurogenic shock follows spinal transaction or brainstem injury with loss of sympathetic outflow beneath the level of injury and consequent vasodilatation. The rapid increase in size of the vascular bed, including venous capacitance vessels, leads to a reduction in the venous return and cardiac output. Hypovolemic shock is classified into four classes (I to IV) depending on the amount of blood loss (Class I: <750 mls; Class II: 750–1500 mls; Class III: 1500-2000 mls; Class IV: >2000 mls). In class I the signs and symptoms are very minimal. In class II, the systolic blood pressure is normal but the diastolic is raised (reduced in classes III and IV). A thready pulse of >120 beats/min indicates Class IV shock (the rate is about 100 beats/min in class II, and weak and >120 beats/min in class III shock).
In septic shock, an early effect of cytokine and other mediators is to cause a fall in the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) due to vasodilatation. The decrease in SVR reduces the afterload on the heart and leads to a reflex increase in cardiac output. Noradrenaline, which causes stimulation of alpha (and to a lesser extent beta-1) receptors, causes a marked increase in the SVR with increase in blood pressure and therefore an increase in left ventricular afterload. Therefore, it is a useful drug in septic shock, but not in hypovolemic shock where there is vasoconstriction. Myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial contusion, chronic cardiac failure, arrhythmia etc. are common causes of cardiogenic shock, of which MI is the commonest cause in surgical patients.

Question

Briefly explain your understanding and the importance of scaphoid fractures.

Correct Answer: 

The scaphoid is the most frequently fractured carpal bone, accounting for approximately 80% of all carpal bone fractures. It is more common in young male adults after a fall, athletic injury or road traffic accident. The mechanism of injury is usually a fall on to the outstretched hand, with the wrist extended to at least 95 degrees. The classical signs of scaphoid fractures are pain on wrist movements, swelling (fullness) of the anatomical snuff box region and tenderness on direct pressure over this region with worsening of the pain when the wrist is ulnar deviated. If initial X-rays are negative (as happens in a majority of cases) and scaphoid fracture a strong possibility, treatment in a scaphoid plaster cast for two weeks followed by repeat X-ray is recommended by which time the fracture may be visible. If the X-ray is still inconclusive, bone scan, CT or MRI may be required to confirm the diagnosis.
The majority of stable, nondisplaced, acute scaphoid fractures heal with conservative treatment. As a general rule, well-managed fractures involving the distal pole have a nearly 100% healing rate, while fractures of the waist have an 80-90% healing rate and proximal pole fractures treated by immobilisation have only a 60-70% rate of union. In cases of non-union, a bone graft or internal fixation using a Herbert screw may be required. The blood supply to the scaphoid is from the radial and anterior interosseous arteries, with 70% of the blood supply entering through the distal ridge. Normally no vessels enter through the proximal pole, and there is no intraosseous anastomosis between the vessels entering the tuberosity and dorsal ridge. The proximal pole receives its blood supply via retrograde flow from vessels that enter the cortex at or distal to the scaphoid waist; therefore, fracture through the waist causes devascularisation of the proximal pole resulting in avascular necrosis (this also explains the high healing rate in distal scaphoid fractures). Degeneration of the wrist and early osteoarthritis are also recognised complications of scaphoid fractures.

Question

What is your understanding of intracranial pressure and its monitoring?

Correct Answer: 

Extradural and subdural haematomas, or any condition leading to cerebral oedema or cerebral engorgement could lead to a rise in the intracranial pressure (ICP). Likewise, obstruction to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathway could lead to a raised ICP, although this is uncommon after head injuries. In the early stages of head injury, there is a non-linear relationship between an expanding haematoma and elevation of ICP – a haematoma may expand without any significant rise in pressure. Once this early compliance is lost, the pressure will rapidly rise. This severely jeopardises cerebral perfusion: cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is equal to mean arterial blood pressure minus ICP (normal CPP is approximately 70 mmHg and the normal ICP in adults is 10-15 mmHg). Therefore, any rise in ICP will cause a corresponding fall in CPP.
As ICP rises, CSF is driven out of the intracranial compartment – the first stage of compensation. This follows the Monro-Kellie hypothesis which states that ‘the sum of intracranial volumes of blood, brain, CSF and other components is constant, and that an increase in any one of these must be offset by a corresponding decrease in another, or else ICP will rise’. With a continuing rise in ICP, brain shifts occur within the cranial cavity. The most important of these brain shifts is uncal transtentorial herniation or ‘coning’. This causes impairment of conscious level, development of an ipsilateral fixed dilated pupil (due to third nerve compression), hemiparesis of the contralateral side (due to compression of the cerebral peduncle), and later cardiovascular and respiratory abnormalities (Cheyne Stokes breathing) due to brain stem compression. The agonal event is often accompanied by hypertension and bradycardia – Cushing’s reflex. Frank papilloedema may be seen at this stage.

Question

Briefly describe your anatomical understanding of the anterior abdominal wall and its clinical significance.

Correct Answer: 

The anterior abdominal wall is comprised of four muscles on each side of the midline: three of these are arranged in layers in the lateral part of the abdominal wall – external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis. As these muscles traverse medially, the fleshy part gives way to an aponeurosis which forms a sheath (rectus sheath) around the fourth muscle – the rectus abdominis. The rectus sheath also contains the superior and inferior epigastric vessels, the lower six intercostal (thoracic) nerves and the small pyramidalis muscles. Between the two recti, all the aponeuroses fuse to form the linea alba, a strong midline fibrous structure. Median incisions through the linea alba are relatively bloodless and allow access to all four abdominal quadrants. The transversalis fascia is a complete fascial sheet lying deep to the abdominal wall muscles surrounding the peritoneal cavity.
The composition of the rectus sheath varies at different levels. The posterior wall of the rectus sheath thins out abruptly a short distance below the umbilicus to form the arcuate line. Above this line, the posterior wall of the sheath comprises the transversus abdominis aponeurosis and the posterior layer of the internal oblique aponeurosis. Below the arcuate line, all three aponeuroses pass anterior to the rectus and thus at this level the posterior surface of the rectus muscle is in direct contact with the transversalis fascia. Above the umbilicus, the superficial tissues of the anterolateral abdominal wall drain to the pectoral group of axillary nodes and below the umbilicus, to the superficial inguinal nodes. The deeper parts of the wall, above the umbilicus, pierce the diaphragm to reach the mediastinal nodes and below it they run to the external iliac and para-aortic nodes. Umbilical tumours (squamous carcinoma) metastasise to the inguinal nodes.

Question

Explain briefly your understanding of bilirubin metabolism by the liver and its associated pathology.

Correct Answer: 

Unconjugated bilirubin is the main breakdown product of the haem moiety of haemoglobin and is derived mostly from effete erythrocytes. Unconjugated bilirubin is insoluble in water and is transported bound to albumin in the plasma. Unconjugated bilirubin is transported across the hepatocyte membrane by a carrier protein, where it is bound to glutathione transferases, enters the endoplasmic reticulum, and is conjugated to bilirubin monoglucuronide and bilirubin diglucuronide, both of which are water soluble. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is caused by overproduction of bilirubin usually as a result of haemolytic disease such as spherocytosis, thalassemia and sickle cell disease. In such disorders, the liver is presented with an excessive load of bilirubin which is unconjugated and therefore absent from the urine. However, a healthy liver attempts to conjugate the majority of the bilirubin presented to it and thus the faecal stercobilinogen and urinary urobilinogen levels are raised (gut bacteria causes conjugated bilirubin to form urobilinogen, of which 20% is excreted in urine and 80% is excreted in stools; urobilinogen on oxidation forms urobilin which is colourless).
Post-hepatic jaundice (due to bile duct obstruction, strictures, and pancreatic, bile duct and ampullary malignancies) causes a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with bilirubin in the urine, causing dark urine; bilirubin is absent in the stools, leading to pale stools. Pruritus is an important feature of both hepatic and post-hepatic cholestasis. Itching which is related to bile salt deposition within the skin is most severe on the extremities and worse in warm weather. When jaundice is caused by a stone in the common bile duct (CBD) dilatation of the gallbladder is rare, but when the duct is obstructed in some other way (e.g.carcinoma of the ampulla, pancreas or bile duct) dilatation is common (Courvoisier’s law). This is because stones in the CBD lead to fibrosis and atrophy of the gall bladder.

Question

Briefly explain your anatomical understanding and common pathologies affecting the knee joint.

Correct Answer: 

The knee joint is a synovial and a hinge joint. The capsule of the knee joint is thin anteriorly and posteriorly but reinforced on either side by strong collateral ligaments. Both the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are intracapsular, but extrasynovial. The medial and lateral menisci are C-shaped with their anterior and posterior horns attached to the intercondylar eminence of the tibia and their outer borders to the joint capsule. The meniscofemoral ligament is adjacent to the posterior cruciate ligament and attaches the posterior border of the lateral meniscus close to the femoral attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament. It stabilises the meniscus during rotation of the femur on the tibia. The oblique popliteal ligament is a lateral expansion from the insertion of semimembranosus which slopes up to the popliteal surface of the femur. The obliquity of this ligament limits rotation-extension in the ‘screw-home’ or locked position.
The anterior cruciate ligament, running upwards and backwards from the anterior part of the tibial plateau towards the lateral condyle of the femur, prevents backward displacement of the femur on the tibial plateau. It also limits extension of the lateral condyle of the femur and of then causes medial rotation of the femur in the ‘screw-home’ position of full extension. The posterior cruciate ligament, running obliquely from the posterior part of the tibia towards the medial condyle of the femur, prevents the femur from sliding forwards off the tibial plateau. In the weight-bearing flexed knee it is the only stabilising factor for the femur and its attached quadriceps. The suprapatellar bursa is continuous with the synovial cavity of the joint, and it thereby provides a route for injecting or withdrawing fluid into or from the joint. After injuries to the joint, fluid accumulates (effusion) in the suprapatellar bursa, causing typical fullness around the knee. The pre- and infrapatellar bursae, however, do not communicate with the joint.

Question

Please explain your understanding of Adult respiratory distress syndrome.

Correct Answer: 

Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute, diffuse inflammatory process resulting from direct or indirect pulmonary injury. It is most commonly seen in sepsis but can also occur after trauma, burns, inhalation injuries, shock and pancreatitis. In post-operative surgical patients, abdominal sepsis or central line sepsis should be considered. Indirect or direct lung injury initiates an abnormal behaviour and movement of neutrophils, platelets and macrophages. Neutrophils and platelets attach to capillary endothelium causing capillary leakage. This leads to oedema of lung tissue and movement of neutrophils and erythrocytes into the lung parenchyma. Lung lymph flow is increased with thickening of the alveolar-capillary membrane. This results in impaired oxygen diffusion and reduced lung compliance as the alveolus is surrounded by fluid. In addition, some of the fluid in the pulmonary parenchyma may leak into the alveoli, giving the characteristic appearance of a hyaline membrane.
ARDS is characterised by refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 <8 kPa at FiO2 >0.4), alveolar inflammation and oedema, reduced total compliance (<30 ml/cm water) and a PaO2 (in mmHg)/FiO2 ratio of <200 (normal is approximately 500). Pulmonary fibrosis in the later stages of the disease leads to a decrease in the functional residual capacity, further decrease in lung compliance, and an increase in the shunt effect. Pulmonary signs are often minimal or non-specific, the patient simply being breathless, progressively tachypnoeic, hypoxic and then cyanotic. Chest X-ray may be normal in the early stages but later shows bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltration. Treatment, in addition to eliminating the precipitating aetiology, involves ventilating the patient in intensive care. Patients are usually nursed in prone position. The tidal volume should be kept low (approximately 6 mls/kg) and so should be the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (high exacerbates pulmonary oedema). The mortality of this condition is as high as 50-70%.

Question

Briefly describe your understanding of the phrenic nerve.

Correct Answer: 

The phrenic nerve arises in the neck from C3, C4 and C5 nerve roots. It lies on the scalenus anterior muscle and enters the thorax between the subclavian artery and the subclavian vein. The nerve then courses down the mediastinum lying anterior to the hilum of the lung, and is squeezed between the pleura and the pericardium. The right phrenic nerve then leaves the thorax along with the inferior vena cava by passing through the vena cava hiatus opening in the diaphragm at the level of T8 vertebra. The left phrenic nerve passes through the muscular part of the diaphragm separately. The phrenic nerve supplies the diaphragm and it is its only motor nerve. It also sends sensory fibres to the mediastinal pleura and pericardium along its course between the pleura and the pericardium. Some sensory fibres are also given off to the diaphragm and the peritoneum. Clinical conditions that cause irritation of the diaphragm (e.g., subphrenic abscess) may lead to referred pain to other somatic regions (such as the shoulder tip) served by the spinal nerves C3, C4 and C5. Irritation of the phrenic nerve (or the tissues supplied by it) can also lead to the hiccup reflex. Injury to the phrenic nerve such as during thoracic surgery may lead to paralysis of that half of the diaphragm leading to breathing difficulties.

Question

Describe briefly your understanding of the term ‘cervical rib’.

Correct Answer: 

A cervical rib is an extra (abnormal) rib that arises from the seventh cervical vertebra (normally, the ribs arise from the 1st thoracic vertebra) and located above the normal first rib. It is a congenital abnormality present in about 1 in 200 people. A cervical rib can compress the brachial plexus or the subclavian vessels causing signs and symptoms in the limb on the affected side. The lower trunk or the medial cord of the brachial plexus is frequently affected leading to motor and sensory symptoms along the median and ulnar nerve distributions. In the hand, this may manifest as wasting of the small muscles of the hand, wasting of the thenar and hypothenar eminences and altered sensation over the digits. Patients may also complain that they are unable to grip objects or to pick small objects. Compression of the subclavian artery may lead to pale and cold hands. The radial pulse in the wrist may be felt to disappear when the patient’s arm is abducted and externally rotated (Adson's sign). This sign can also be demonstrated by asking the patient to take a deep breath and hold it for about 15 to 30 seconds whilst simultaneously extending and flexing the neck to one side (Adson’s test). The cervical rib may not be picked up on a plain radiography as they may be cartilaginous (or a fibrous band). In such instances, an MRI scan is useful in diagnosing the condition. MRI or a CT scan can distinguish cervical root injury from degenerative spurs, herniated discs or other aetiologies.

Question

What is the difference between a carcinoma and a sarcoma?

Correct Answer: 

A carcinoma is a malignant tumour of epithelial cells while a sarcoma is a malignant tumour of connective tissue cells. A carcinoma can also arise in organs derived from the mesoderm; examples include carcinoma ovaries, endometrium, and fallopian tube, and carcinoma of the kidney.

Question

Briefly describe some histological features seen in a malignant tumour?

Correct Answer: 

There may be increased mitosis, abnormal mitosis (tripolar, tetrapolar, sunburst, bizarre), an increase in the nuclear-cytoplasmic ration, pleomorphism (variance of size and shape of tumour cells), and hyperchromatism (increased amounts of DNA leading to dark-stained nuclei). In addition, there may be focal or extensive areas of haemorrhage and necrosis due to abnormal vascularity. The tissues may also have infiltrative borders.

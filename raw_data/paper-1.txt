The MS AKT Exam Board has put together a 200-item practice exam (2 x 100 item  
papers) to help medical students prepare for the UK Medical School Applied  
Knowledge Test (MS AKT). Blueprinted to the GMC Content Map this exam has  
been designed to reflect the style and type of question that students will encounter  
when the MS AKT goes live in 2024-25 or 2023-24 for schools that have penultimate  
year exams.   
   
The practice exam comes with and without the answer options.  
  
We would like to recognise the contribution of medical schools , and members of the  
AKT Exam Board in particular, in producing this exam which we hope students will  
find a valuable resource.   
  
Should you have any questions about the clinical content of the practice exam  
please speak to the Assessment Lead in your school in the first instance.   
  
  
Any redistribution or reproduction of part or all of the contents in any form is  
prohibited other than for personal, educational and non-commercial use.

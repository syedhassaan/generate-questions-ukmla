A 43-year-old man develops sudden-onset high fever and dyspnoea. He has a harsh, pan-systolic murmur at the apex. Echocardiography reveals a large vegetation on his mitral valve.
What findings would you expect to be present to confirm your suspicions for the most likely infective organism?
Gram-negative coccus, maltose fermenter
Gram-negative coccus, maltose non-fermenter
Gram-positive coccus, catalase −ve, partial haemolysis
Gram-positive coccus, catalase +ve, coagulase +ve
Gram-positive coccus, catalase +ve, coagulase −ve
Explanation
Gram-positive coccus, catalase +ve, coagulase +ve
This pattern identifies Staphylococcus aureus that grows in yellow colonies in culture. This is the most common organism in acute, febrile native valve endocarditis.
Gram-negative coccus, maltose fermenter
Gram-negative coccus, maltose fermenter identifies Neisseria meningitidis, which is a common cause of septicaemia and bacterial meningitis.
Gram-negative coccus, maltose non-fermenter
Gram-negative coccus, maltose non-fermenter identifies Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is a common sexually transmitted infection.
Gram-positive coccus, catalase −ve, partial haemolysis
Gram-positive coccus, catalase −ve, partial haemolysis: this pattern identifies Streptococcus pneumoniae. It may also be optochin-sensitive.
Gram-positive coccus, catalase +ve, coagulase −ve
Gram-positive coccus, catalase +ve, coagulase −ve: this pattern identifies Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is the most common organism in prosthetic valve endocarditis.

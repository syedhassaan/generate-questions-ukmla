Explanation: The management of snake bites can be complex and varies depending on several factors including the species of snake involved, severity of envenoming, time since bite, and availability of specific antivenoms. In general, patients with suspected or confirmed venomous snake bites should receive supportive care including immobilization of the affected limb, analgesia, wound care, and monitoring for signs of systemic toxicity such as hypotension or coagulopathy. Antivenom therapy may be indicated in certain cases but carries risks including anaphylaxis and serum sickness. Patients receiving antivenom should be closely monitored for adverse reactions and treated promptly if necessary.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to her GP with multiple insect bites on her arms and legs that have become increasingly itchy over the past week despite using topical corticosteroids as directed.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What other conditions should be considered? What additional investigations or treatments might be indicated? How can this condition best be prevented?

A. Scabies infestation
B. Flea bites
C. Bed bug bites
D. Mosquito bites
E. Spider bites

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Scabies is a parasitic infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and typically presents with intense pruritus and erythematous papules or burrows in intertriginous areas such as the wrists, fingers, and genital region. Other conditions that may present similarly include flea or bed bug bites, contact dermatitis, or other types of eczema. Diagnosis can be confirmed through skin scrapings for microscopic examination or clinical suspicion alone may warrant treatment with topical permethrin or oral ivermectin. Prevention involves avoiding close contact with infected individuals and their belongings.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being bitten by an unknown insect while gardening. He reports immediate pain and swelling at the site of the bite followed by generalized urticaria, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty breathing.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with heavy vaginal bleeding, 3 weeks after giving birth by Caesarean section. She has a history of von Willebrand disease and had received prophylactic treatment during pregnancy. Her temperature is 37.8 ÂºC, pulse 110 bpm and blood pressure 90/60 mmHg.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? What are the potential complications associated with her underlying medical condition? How would you monitor and manage her bleeding? 

A. Administer tranexamic acid
B. Perform an emergency hysterectomy
C. Start intravenous oxytocin infusion
D. Give fresh frozen plasma transfusion
E. Insert a Bakri balloon

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Patients with von Willebrand disease have an increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage due to impaired platelet function and clotting factor deficiencies. The most appropriate initial management in this case would be to insert a Bakri balloon to control the bleeding while further investigations are carried out to identify any other sources of bleeding or coagulation abnormalities. Fresh frozen plasma can be used if there is evidence of significant coagulopathy, but it should be used cautiously as it may exacerbate fluid overload in patients who have already received large volumes of crystalloid fluids during resuscitation efforts.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with severe vaginal bleeding, one day after giving birth vaginally at term gestation without complications. She reports feeling lightheaded and dizzy on standing up from bed or chair, but denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.
On examination, she appears pale and clammy, her heart rate is 130 bpm, blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Her uterus is soft and non-tender, but there is active bleeding from the vagina.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What are the immediate steps that need to be taken? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Amniotic fluid embolism
B. Placenta accreta
C. Uterine rupture
D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation
E. Postpartum haemorrhage

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient has signs of hypovolemic shock due to significant blood loss following childbirth, which suggests postpartum haemorrhage as the most likely diagnosis. Immediate resuscitation with crystalloid fluids and blood products should be initiated while simultaneously identifying and addressing any potential sources of bleeding such as retained placental tissue or uterine atony. If conservative measures fail to control the bleeding, surgical interventions such as uterine artery ligation or hysterectomy may be necessary.

Question
A 26-year-old woman presents to her obstetrician for a routine follow-up appointment six weeks after giving birth by Caesarean section without complications.
She reports experiencing intermittent vaginal spotting over the past few days, but denies any pain, fever or other symptoms.
On examination, her vital signs are within normal limits and her abdominal incision site appears well-healed with no signs of infection or tenderness.

What is the most likely cause of her vaginal spotting? What investigations would you perform? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Endometritis 
B. Retained products of conception 
C. Cervical ectropion 
D. Vaginal laceration 
E. Hormonal changes

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The most likely cause of vaginal spotting in this case is cervical ectropion, which can occur due to hormonal changes during pregnancy and childbirth and typically resolves spontaneously over time. However, retained products of conception or endometritis should also be considered and ruled out with appropriate investigations such as ultrasound or endometrial biopsy if necessary. In the absence of any concerning findings on examination or investigation, conservative management with observation and reassurance is usually sufficient for cervical ectropion.

Ultrasound scan is the most appropriate imaging modality for further evaluation as it can differentiate between an abscess and other causes of breast lumps such as fibroadenomas or cysts.

Question
A 36-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of recurrent right-sided breast pain that has been bothering her for several months. She reports that the pain is usually intermittent, sharp, and located in the upper outer quadrant of her right breast without any associated skin changes or nipple discharge. The patient denies any family history of breast cancer but mentions that she had a benign lump removed from her left breast five years ago.
On examination, there are no palpable masses or lymphadenopathy noted on either side. However, there is mild tenderness on palpation of the right upper outer quadrant.
Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Full blood count (FBC) 
B. Thyroid function tests
C. Serum prolactin level
D. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level
E. Breast biopsy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation described suggests a possible non-cancerous cause such as fibroadenoma or phyllodes tumor; however, malignancy cannot be ruled out based on symptoms alone. Therefore, a breast biopsy would be the most appropriate investigation to establish a definitive diagnosis and rule out malignancy.

A. Acute delirium
B. Alzheimer's dementia 
C. Vascular dementia 
D. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
E. Lewy body dementia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patientâs acute onset of confusion, agitation and visual hallucinations in the setting of fever suggests an acute confusional state or delirium rather than chronic cognitive impairment such as Alzheimerâs or vascular dementia (options B & C). Although Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (option D) can present acutely with confusion, it is rare and not typically associated with fever or hypotension as seen in this case. Lewy body dementia (option E) may also present acutely but usually involves fluctuating cognition, parkinsonism features and/or visual hallucinations.

Question
An elderly woman was brought to the hospital by her daughter due to worsening confusion over the past few days along with difficulty walking and urinary incontinence. She had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis and depression for which she was taking multiple medications including lisinopril, atorvastatin, naproxen and sertraline.
On examination, she appears disoriented and unable to follow commands. She has a shuffling gait with reduced arm swing, cogwheel rigidity and bilateral resting tremors. Urinalysis reveals leukocytes and nitrites suggestive of urinary tract infection (UTI).
Which one of the following medications is most likely contributing to her current presentation? 

A. Lisinopril
B. Atorvastatin 
C. Naproxen 
D. Sertraline 
E. None of the above

Among the medications listed, naproxen (option C) is known to have anticholinergic effects that can exacerbate cognitive impairment in elderly patients with pre-existing dementia or Parkinsonism.

Question
A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of confusion and forgetfulness over the past few months along with difficulty finding words and completing tasks at work. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking but denies any recent head injury or stroke-like symptoms.
On examination, he appears alert and oriented but demonstrates impaired attention span, memory deficits and decreased fluency in speech production.
Which one of the following diagnostic tests should be ordered first? 

A. CT brain without contrast
B. MRI brain without contrast
C. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
D. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential
E. Serum electrolytes and glucose levels

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patientâs symptoms suggest mild cognitive impairment or early-stage Alzheimer's disease rather than acute confusional state or delirium as seen in previous cases. Therefore, imaging studies such as CT or MRI brain (options A & B) may not provide additional information beyond ruling out structural lesions such as tumors or infarcts. The MMSE (option C) is a screening tool for cognitive impairment but does not establish a definitive diagnosis. CBC with differential (option D) may be helpful in ruling out infectious or hematologic causes of confusion, but given the patientâs age and medical history, serum electrolytes and glucose levels (option E) should be checked first to rule out metabolic derangements that can mimic cognitive impairment.

What is the most likely diagnosis for this fetal abnormality? What other associated anomalies should be considered? 

A. Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis
B. Transposition of the great arteries
C. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
D. Double outlet right ventricle
E. Truncus arteriosus

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: VSDs are commonly seen in double outlet right ventricle (DORV), where both great vessels arise from the right ventricle instead of their normal positions on opposite sides of the heart. Other associated anomalies include pulmonary stenosis or atresia, transposition of the great arteries, and coarctation of the aorta.

Question
A 3-day-old male infant presents with respiratory distress and cyanosis shortly after birth. Physical examination reveals a harsh systolic murmur heard best over the left upper sternal border, along with decreased breath sounds on the left side of his chest.
What is the most likely diagnosis? What other congenital anomaly should be suspected? 

A. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
B. Coarctation of the aorta
C. Pulmonary valve stenosis
D. Atrial septal defect (ASD)
E. Ventricular septal defect (VSD)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Coarctation of the aorta is characterized by narrowing or constriction in part of the descending thoracic aorta, leading to decreased blood flow to the lower extremities and increased pressure in the upper body. It is commonly associated with bicuspid aortic valve, which can cause further obstruction or regurgitation.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents for her first prenatal visit at 10 weeks of gestation. She reports a family history of cystic fibrosis (CF) and requests genetic testing to determine if she is a carrier of the disease. The test results reveal that she is indeed a CF carrier.
What are the chances that her fetus will inherit CF? What other congenital anomalies should be considered? 

A. 1 in 4 chance
B. 1 in 8 chance
C. 1 in 16 chance
D. 1 in 32 chance
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: If both parents are carriers of an autosomal recessive disorder like CF, there is a 25% chance with each pregnancy that their child will inherit two copies of the mutated gene and develop the disease. However, being a carrier does not necessarily mean that the fetus will have any congenital anomalies related to CF, such as pancreatic insufficiency or meconium ileus. Additional testing may be needed to assess fetal health and development during pregnancy.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the GP with complaints of chronic constipation for the last six months. He has tried increasing his dietary intake of fibre, drinking more fluids and taking over-the-counter laxatives but none have provided him with any relief. He also complains of abdominal pain, bloating and nausea. On further questioning, he reveals that he has a history of opioid use for chronic back pain which started around the same time as his constipation symptoms.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents to the GP with complaints of chronic constipation for the last two years. He reports having to strain excessively during defecation and often feels like he has not completely emptied his bowels afterwards. He denies any other gastrointestinal symptoms or significant medical history.
On examination, his vital signs are normal. Abdominal examination reveals no abnormalities. Digital rectal examination shows hard stool in the rectum.
Which one of the following is most likely causing his symptoms? 

A. Slow transit constipation
B. Pelvic floor dysfunction
C. Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C)
D. Colonic inertia
E. Hirschsprung's disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Pelvic floor dysfunction can cause incomplete evacuation due to inadequate relaxation or paradoxical contraction of pelvic floor muscles during defecation, leading to chronic constipation symptoms such as straining and feeling unemptied after bowel movements.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP requesting contraception advice. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Her last DVT was two years ago, which occurred while she was on the combined oral contraceptive pill. She is currently not taking any medication but would like to start a reliable method of contraception as she is in a new relationship. The patient's BMI is 30 kg/m2, and her blood pressure reading is within normal limits. Which of the following methods of contraception would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Copper intrauterine device
B. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system
C. Progestogen-only injectable
D. Progesterone only implant
E. Barrier methods

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Given the patientâs history of DVT and PE, it is recommended that she avoids estrogen-containing contraceptives such as the combined oral contraceptive pill or transdermal patch due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Intrauterine devices containing levonorgestrel are considered safe options for women with a history of VTE as they do not contain estrogen and have been shown to have no significant effect on coagulation factors.

Question
A 26-year-old woman presents to her GP requesting contraception advice after giving birth six weeks ago via caesarean section delivery. She reports that she is exclusively breastfeeding her baby every four hours during the day and night without supplementing with formula milk or solid foods yet; however, she plans to introduce solids soon when the baby turns six months old. Her medical history includes gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed at 28 weeks' gestation, which required insulin therapy until delivery, and hypertension controlled with labetalol throughout pregnancy until now postpartum period where it has resolved. Her BMI is 25 kg/m2, and her blood pressure reading is within normal limits. Which of the following methods of contraception would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Combined oral contraceptive pill
B. Progestogen-only injectable
C. Copper intrauterine device
D. Barrier methods
E. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Breastfeeding can affect the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives due to decreased milk production caused by estrogen-containing contraceptives, which may lead to a decrease in prolactin levels that stimulate lactation. However, progestogen-only contraceptives are considered safe options during breastfeeding as they do not affect milk production or infant growth and development. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) has been shown to have high efficacy rates and is recommended as a first-line option for postpartum women who are breastfeeding.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents to her GP requesting contraception advice after having an ectopic pregnancy six months ago that was managed with methotrexate therapy without any complications or surgery required. She reports no other significant medical history, including no history of sexually transmitted infections or pelvic inflammatory disease, and she denies smoking or alcohol use. Her last menstrual period was two weeks ago, and she has regular cycles every 28 days lasting four days with moderate flow without dysmenorrhea or intermenstrual bleeding/spotting. Her BMI is 22 kg/m2, and her blood pressure reading is within normal limits. Which of the following methods of contraception would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Combined oral contraceptive pill
B. Copper intrauterine device
C. Progesterone only implant
D. Barrier methods
E. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Women with a history of ectopic pregnancy are at increased risk for subsequent ectopic pregnancies, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of recurrent ectopic pregnancy. Copper-containing IUDs are considered safe options for women with a history of ectopic pregnancy as they do not contain hormones that may affect tubal motility or increase the risk of another ectopic pregnancy.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful? 

A. Chest x-ray
B. Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)
C. Mantoux test
D. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
E. Sputum culture

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest possible pulmonary tuberculosis which can occur in healthcare workers due to occupational exposure despite no history of direct contact with infected individuals or travel to endemic areas. PCR testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is more sensitive than sputum culture and can detect low levels of bacteria making it useful in early diagnosis especially when combined with other tests such as IGRA or Mantoux test.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Central retinal artery occlusion
B. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
C. Optic neuritis
D. Retinal detachment
E. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's clinical features are consistent with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) which results from obstruction of blood flow through the central retinal artery leading to acute painless monocular blindness, pale retina, cherry-red spot at macula, and relative afferent pupillary defect as seen in this case. CRAO is considered an ophthalmologic emergency requiring urgent intervention within six hours to improve chances of visual recovery but unfortunately has poor prognosis even with prompt treatment due to irreversible damage to retinal cells caused by ischemia.

Question
A couple presents to the genetics clinic with concerns about their family history of a possible genetic disorder. The husband's father and grandfather both had early-onset Alzheimer's disease, while the wife's mother and grandmother had breast cancer at a young age. After thorough examination and testing, it is determined that the husband has inherited a mutation in the PSEN1 gene associated with Alzheimer's disease, while the wife carries a BRCA2 mutation linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.

Which of the following statements regarding these mutations is true? 

A. Both mutations are autosomal dominant.
B. Only the PSEN1 mutation exhibits genetic anticipation.
C. Carriers of both mutations have an increased risk for developing multiple types of cancers.
D. Children of carriers have a 50% chance of inheriting either mutation.
E. Neither mutation can be detected through genetic screening.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Autosomal dominant inheritance means that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the condition, which is true for both PSEN1 and BRCA2 mutations. Genetic anticipation refers to earlier onset or more severe symptoms in successive generations due to expansion of trinucleotide repeats, which occurs in some conditions like myotonic dystrophy but not in Alzheimer's or breast cancer. While individuals carrying either mutation do have an increased risk for certain types of cancer (Alzheimer's does not increase cancer risk), they are not necessarily at higher risk for multiple types as suggested by option C. Finally, both mutations can be detected through genetic screening.

Question
A woman comes to her GP concerned about her family history after her sister was recently diagnosed with Huntington's disease (HD). Their father also had HD before passing away from complications related to the disease. The patient underwent predictive testing and was found to carry the expanded CAG repeat associated with HD.

Which of the following statements regarding this patient is false? 

A. The patient's children have a 50% chance of inheriting the expanded CAG repeat.
B. Symptoms of HD typically appear around age 40, but can present earlier or later depending on the number of repeats.
C. There is currently no cure for HD, but symptomatic treatment can improve quality of life.
D. The patient's sister may also carry the mutation even if she has not yet developed symptoms.
E. The patient will definitely develop symptoms of HD at some point in her life.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant condition caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene. Individuals with 36 or more repeats are considered to have the disease, while those with fewer than 27 do not develop symptoms and are unlikely to pass on the mutation to their offspring. Those with between 27 and 35 repeats fall into a "gray zone" where it is unclear whether they will develop symptoms or not, and testing does not provide definitive answers about their future health status. Therefore, option E is false as it implies that all carriers will eventually develop symptoms, which is not necessarily true.

Question
A couple presents to their obstetrician for genetic counseling after learning that both partners have family histories suggestive of possible genetic disorders. The husband's mother had early-onset Alzheimer's disease, while his father had multiple relatives affected by colon cancer at young ages. The wife's brother was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as an infant, and her maternal grandmother died from ovarian cancer.

Which of the following statements regarding this couple is true? 

A. Genetic testing should be performed on both partners before attempting pregnancy.
B. Both Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer exhibit anticipation due to trinucleotide repeat expansions.
C. Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis should only be offered to individuals with a known family history of the condition.
D. Ovarian cancer is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
E. The couple's children may be at increased risk for developing multiple types of cancers.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Given the family histories described, it would be appropriate to offer genetic testing to both partners before attempting pregnancy in order to identify any potential risks to offspring and allow for informed decision-making about reproductive options. While trinucleotide repeat expansions do occur in some conditions like Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy, they are not a feature of Alzheimer's or colon cancer as suggested by option B. Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis is recommended for all individuals regardless of family history due to its relatively high carrier frequency in certain populations (e.g. Caucasians). Ovarian cancer can be caused by mutations in several different genes, but most cases are not inherited in a simple Mendelian pattern; therefore, option D is incorrect. Finally, while the couple's children may be at increased risk for certain conditions based on their family histories, there is no indication that they would necessarily be at higher risk for multiple types of cancers as suggested by option E.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents with a history of muscle twitching in his left leg for the past 6 months. He reports that the twitching is more pronounced when he is at rest and improves with activity.

Which medication among these three is most likely responsible for this presentation? 

A. Cimetidine
B. Spironolactone
C. Ketoconazole
D. All of the above 
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Gynaecomastia can be caused by various drugs such as cimetidine (H2 receptor antagonist), spironolactone (aldosterone antagonist), and ketoconazole (antifungal). These drugs inhibit testosterone synthesis or block its action leading to an increase in oestrogen/testosterone ratio resulting in gynaecomastia.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents with unilateral breast swelling that started six months ago, which has now become more prominent and painful over time. He denies any nipple discharge or trauma to the chest wall. On examination, there is a firm mobile mass measuring around 4 cm in diameter located under the left nipple-areolar complex without any axillary lymphadenopathy.

What could be the possible diagnosis? 

A. Breast cancer 
B. Fibroadenoma 
C. Lipoma 
D. Gynaecomastia 
E. Phyllodes tumour

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features described are suggestive of phyllodes tumour which is a rare fibroepithelial neoplasm of the breast commonly seen in young adults presenting as a painless lump with rapid growth over several weeks/months causing asymmetry of breasts along with skin changes like dimpling, retraction or ulceration. It can be benign, borderline or malignant and requires surgical excision with wide margins.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to his GP for a routine check-up. He has no significant medical history but is concerned about the recent development of bilateral breast enlargement over the past year without any associated pain or discharge from nipples. On examination, there is visible glandular tissue in both breasts without any palpable masses or lymphadenopathy.

What could be the possible cause? 

A. Idiopathic 
B. Testicular tumour 
C. Liver cirrhosis 
D. Klinefelter syndrome 
E. Hyperthyroidism

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Bilateral gynaecomastia in an adult male can occur due to various causes such as idiopathic (most common), hormonal imbalances like testicular tumours, hypogonadism, hyperthyroidism, genetic disorders like Klinefelter syndrome or liver diseases like cirrhosis leading to impaired metabolism of oestrogen resulting in its accumulation causing breast enlargement.

Question
A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of painless gross haematuria. He has a past medical history of hypertension and is currently on medication for it. On examination, his blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg and there is no palpable abdominal mass or tenderness. Blood tests reveal elevated creatinine levels at 300 Î¼mol/L (normal range: 50-120 Î¼mol/L) and normal electrolyte levels. Urine analysis shows numerous red blood cells but no proteinuria or casts.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's haematuria? 

A. Renal cell carcinoma
B. Acute glomerulonephritis
C. Prostate cancer
D. Bladder stones
E. Benign prostatic hyperplasia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presentation of painless gross haematuria in an older male with hypertension raises suspicion for renal cell carcinoma, which can present with these symptoms even in the absence of other signs such as flank pain or a palpable mass.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of visible haematuria over the past year, each lasting several days before resolving spontaneously without treatment. She has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications except for oral contraceptives. There are no other urinary symptoms such as dysuria or frequency, and physical examination is unremarkable apart from mild suprapubic tenderness on deep palpation.
Which investigation would be most appropriate to diagnose the cause of her haematuria? 

A. CT urogram
B. Cystoscopy
C. Renal biopsy
D. Ultrasound scan of kidneys and bladder
E. Urine culture

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Recurrent episodes of visible haematuria in a young female with no other urinary symptoms or significant past medical history raises suspicion for bladder cancer. Cystoscopy is the gold standard investigation for diagnosing bladder cancer, as it allows direct visualization of the bladder lining and biopsy if necessary.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with a two-week history of intermittent visible haematuria associated with mild dysuria and suprapubic discomfort. He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, both well-controlled on medication. On examination, there is tenderness over the pubic symphysis but no palpable abdominal mass or lymphadenopathy. Blood tests reveal normal renal function and electrolyte levels.
Which investigation would be most appropriate to diagnose the cause of this patient's haematuria? 

A. CT urogram
B. Cystoscopy
C. Renal ultrasound scan
D. Urine cytology
E. Serum PSA level

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation of intermittent visible haematuria in an older male with risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension raises suspicion for bladder cancer or other malignancies involving the genitourinary system. Urine cytology can help identify malignant cells shed from the urinary tract, although it may not always be sensitive enough to detect early-stage cancers or low-grade tumours.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents with a history of recurrent haemoptysis for the past six months. She has been coughing up blood-stained sputum intermittently, and her symptoms have worsened over the last two weeks. She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath or fever. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2, both well controlled on medications. On examination, she appears comfortable at rest with normal vital signs. Chest auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe with occasional wheezes heard bilaterally. There are no added heart sounds or murmurs appreciated. Laboratory investigations reveal mild anaemia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Bronchiectasis
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Lung cancer
D. Goodpasture syndrome
E. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is concerning for lung malignancy given her persistent haemoptysis, smoking history and abnormal chest exam findings.

Question
A 65-year-old male smoker presents to his primary care physician complaining of cough productive of yellowish sputum occasionally streaked with blood for the past three months associated with fatigue and weight loss of approximately 10 kg during this period despite having an increased appetite. He also reports experiencing night sweats but denies any fever or chills, dyspnoea or chest pain.
On physical examination, he appears cachectic but not in acute distress; there are no peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease nor palpable lymph nodes noted.
His respiratory rate is 18/min and oxygen saturation on room air is 94%. Auscultation reveals bilateral crackles more prominent at the lung bases.

On examination, she appears comfortable at rest with normal vital signs except for a temperature of 38Â°Celsius. Chest auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds over the right lower lobe without any added heart sounds or murmurs appreciated.
Laboratory investigations reveal leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Tuberculosis
B. Pneumonia
C. Lung abscess
D. Pulmonary embolism
E. Bronchiectasis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is concerning for pulmonary tuberculosis given her constitutional symptoms, haemoptysis and abnormal chest exam findings; further workup including sputum microscopy and culture should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment promptly if indicated.

Question
A 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department (ED) after a road traffic accident. He was not wearing a helmet and sustained a head injury when he fell off his motorcycle. On arrival, he is unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 6/15. His pupils are unequal and sluggishly reactive. CT scan shows diffuse cerebral oedema with midline shift.
Which of the following interventions should be considered in this patient? 

A. Hyperventilation
B. Mannitol infusion
C. Sedation
D. Decompressive craniectomy 
E. Steroid therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient has severe traumatic brain injury with signs of raised intracranial pressure on CT scan, which necessitates urgent intervention to prevent further neurological damage or death. Options A and E are not recommended due to potential adverse effects, while option B may cause hypotension and worsen cerebral perfusion pressure in some cases. Option C may be used for short-term control of agitation but does not address the underlying pathology causing increased intracranial pressure. Decompressive craniectomy involves removing part of the skull to allow room for swelling brain tissue, thereby reducing intracranial pressure and improving outcomes in selected patients.

Question
An elderly woman presents to the ED after falling down stairs at home and hitting her head on the ground floor landing. She reports loss of consciousness for several minutes before regaining awareness but cannot recall any events leading up to or immediately after the fall.
On examination, she has a GCS score of 14/15 with no focal neurological deficits noted; however, there is mild confusion present.
CT scan reveals an acute subdural haematoma overlying the left hemisphere measuring 1cm in thickness.
What is the most appropriate management step? 

A. Observation only
B. Anticoagulation reversal
C. Craniotomy for evacuation of haematoma
D. Steroid therapy 
E. Repeat CT scan in 24 hours

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Acute subdural haematomas are a serious complication of head injury, particularly in the elderly population with pre-existing brain atrophy and increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. In this case, given the thickness of the haematoma and presence of mild confusion, urgent surgical intervention is required to evacuate the clot and prevent further neurological deterioration. Options A, D and E are not appropriate management steps for acute subdural haematomas, while option B may be considered if there is evidence of ongoing bleeding or coagulopathy.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to the ED following a fall from a height of approximately 10 feet onto concrete ground below. He was not wearing any protective gear and landed on his head.
On examination, he has a GCS score of 7/15 with no focal neurological deficits noted; however, there is significant bruising over his forehead and scalp.
CT scan reveals multiple fractures involving both frontal bones with underlying contusions and lacerations.
Which of the following complications should be closely monitored? 

A. Seizures
B. Intracranial hypertension
C. Meningitis 
D. Hydrocephalus 
E. Subarachnoid haemorrhage 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Frontal bone fractures can cause significant damage to underlying brain tissue due to direct impact forces or shearing injuries from bony fragments penetrating into the cranial cavity. This patient is at high risk for developing intracranial hypertension due to cerebral oedema or mass effect from associated contusions or lacerations seen on CT scan; therefore close monitoring with serial neurological examinations and imaging studies is necessary to detect and treat any signs of raised intracranial pressure. Options A, C, D and E are less likely complications in this patient given the mechanism of injury and imaging findings.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe headache, which he describes as "the worst headache of his life." He has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications. On examination, he is alert and oriented but complains of photophobia and neck stiffness. His blood pressure is elevated at 170/100 mmHg, and there are no focal neurological deficits.

A CT scan shows subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the basal cisterns. The patient is transferred to the neurosurgical unit for further management.

Which of the following is true regarding SAH?

A. It is most commonly caused by hypertension
B. It can be diagnosed on clinical grounds alone
C. Lumbar puncture should be performed immediately if CT scan is negative
D. Nimodipine should be started immediately to prevent vasospasm
E. Surgical intervention is rarely required

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker that reduces the risk of cerebral vasospasm after SAH and improves outcomes in patients with aneurysmal SAH.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents with recurrent headaches that have been occurring for several months. She describes them as throbbing pain on one side of her head associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. They usually last for several hours or days and interfere with her daily activities.

On examination, she appears well-nourished and hydrated with normal vital signs. Neurological examination including fundoscopy is unremarkable.

What would be the next appropriate step in managing this patient? 

A. Start prophylactic treatment with topiramate 
B. Perform a lumbar puncture 
C. Order an MRI brain 
D. Prescribe sumatriptan as abortive therapy 
E. Advise lifestyle modifications such as stress reduction and regular sleep patterns

Question
A 29-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe vomiting and dehydration. She is currently 12 weeks pregnant and has a history of hyperemesis gravidarum in her previous pregnancy, which required hospitalization for intravenous fluid replacement and anti-emetic therapy. On examination, she appears pale and dehydrated, with dry mucous membranes and reduced skin turgor. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate is 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and temperature is normal. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated serum urea and creatinine levels, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and ketonuria.

Which of the following would be the most appropriate initial management strategy for this patient?

A. Oral rehydration therapy with electrolyte solution
B. Intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline
C. Anti-emetic therapy with metoclopramide
D. Nutritional support with enteral feeding tube placement

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents to the obstetrics clinic at 6 weeks gestation with complaints of persistent nausea and vomiting since conception that are affecting her daily activities but not causing weight loss or dehydration yet. She reports trying several non-pharmacological remedies such as ginger tea, acupressure bands, small frequent meals without relief.
Which one of the following medications would be considered first-line treatment for this patient? 

A. Ondansetron 
B. Metoclopramide 
C. Promethazine 
D. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 
E. Diclegis (doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Pyridoxine is a first-line treatment for mild to moderate nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, as it has been shown to be safe and effective with minimal side effects. Ondansetron should only be considered if other treatments have failed or symptoms are severe.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents at 20 weeks gestation with persistent hyperemesis gravidarum despite multiple anti-emetic therapies including ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine, and corticosteroids. She has lost over 10% of her pre-pregnancy weight and requires frequent hospital admissions for intravenous fluid resuscitation. Her obstetrician discusses the option of enteral feeding tube placement for nutritional support.
Which one of the following types of feeding tubes would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Nasogastric tube 
B. Nasojejunal tube 
C. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube 
D. Jejunostomy tube 
E. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with refractory hyperemesis gravidarum who require enteral feeding support, nasojejunal tubes are preferred over nasogastric tubes to reduce the risk of aspiration due to delayed gastric emptying caused by gastroparesis from prolonged vomiting episodes. PEG or jejunostomy tubes may be considered if long-term enteral feeding is required beyond several weeks or months, respectively, but carry higher risks of complications such as infection or dislodgement compared to temporary nasoenteral tubes. TPN is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate any form of enteral feeding due to severe gastrointestinal dysfunction or obstruction that cannot be corrected surgically or medically.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a hypertensive crisis. His blood pressure is measured at 220/140 mmHg, and he reports severe headache, blurred vision, and chest pain. The patient has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He currently takes metformin, simvastatin, and aspirin.

Further investigations reveal elevated levels of serum creatinine (180 Âµmol/L), proteinuria (3+ on dipstick), and an ECG showing left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient is started on intravenous antihypertensives for immediate control of his blood pressure.

Which of the following is the most appropriate long-term management strategy for this patient? 

A. Renal artery stenting
B. Bariatric surgery 
C. Intensive glycemic control 
D. Combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium channel blocker 
E. Referral to a hypertension specialist clinic

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's presentation suggests end-organ damage from uncontrolled hypertension, which requires urgent treatment to prevent further complications such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Long-term management should focus on reducing cardiovascular risk factors through lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and smoking cessation, as well as pharmacological interventions targeting blood pressure control and secondary prevention measures for associated comorbidities like diabetes mellitus.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents to her GP with newly diagnosed hypertension during routine screening tests at her local pharmacy where she had been monitoring her blood pressure regularly over the last few weeks due to a family history of heart disease.

Her initial readings were consistently above 150/90 mmHg despite several attempts at rechecking them in different settings including home monitoring devices provided by the pharmacy itself.

The GP initiates treatment with lisinopril, and the patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks. At her next visit, the patient reports feeling dizzy and lightheaded when standing up from a seated position.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of these symptoms? 

A. Hypovolemia 
B. Orthostatic hypotension 
C. Adverse drug reaction
D. Cerebrovascular accident 
E. Transient ischemic attack

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that can cause orthostatic hypotension as a side effect due to its vasodilatory effects on blood vessels. This can lead to dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing up from a sitting or lying down position, especially in older patients who may have pre-existing autonomic dysfunction or other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with hypertension that has been difficult to control despite multiple antihypertensive medications including lisinopril, atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and spironolactone.

Further investigations reveal elevated levels of aldosterone and renin activity suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome). The patient undergoes adrenal vein sampling which confirms unilateral adrenal adenoma.

Which of the following is the most appropriate management strategy? 

A. Surgical resection of the affected adrenal gland 
B. Medical therapy with potassium-sparing diuretics 
C. Radiofrequency ablation of the affected adrenal gland 
D. Observation and monitoring for disease progression 
E. Combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Primary hyperaldosteronism caused by unilateral adrenal adenoma (Conn's syndrome) is a surgically curable form of hypertension that requires removal of the affected adrenal gland. Medical therapy with potassium-sparing diuretics or combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be used as adjunctive measures to control blood pressure in the preoperative period, but definitive treatment involves surgical resection of the adenoma. Radiofrequency ablation is not a standard treatment option for Conn's syndrome.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset severe back pain that radiates down his left leg. He reports a history of chronic low back pain, but this episode is different in intensity and quality. On examination, he has reduced range of motion in his lumbar spine and tenderness over the L5-S1 region. An MRI scan shows a large herniated disc at the L5-S1 level compressing the left S1 nerve root.

Which muscle group would be expected to show weakness on examination?

A. Quadriceps
B. Tibialis anterior
C. Gastrocnemius
D. Hamstrings
E. Gluteus maximus

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The tibialis anterior muscle is innervated by the L4 spinal nerve, while gastrocnemius is innervated by S1 and hamstrings are innervated by L5-S2 spinal nerves. As there is compression of the left S1 nerve root, weakness in muscles supplied by it such as gastrocnemius can be expected.

Question
A 65-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis presents with acute-onset right hip pain after a fall from standing height onto her right side. She is unable to bear weight on her right leg and has significant swelling around her hip joint.

On examination, she has limited passive range of motion in all directions due to pain and guarding.

What type of hip fracture should be suspected based on this presentation? 

A. Intertrochanteric fracture 
B. Subcapital fracture 
C. Transcervical fracture 
D. Acetabular fracture 
E. Femoral neck fracture 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's age, history of osteoporosis, mechanism of injury (fall from standing height), inability to bear weight on affected limb and limited passive range of motion in all directions suggest a femoral neck fracture.

Question
A 70-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presents to his GP with a complaint of pain and stiffness in both shoulders for the past few months. He reports difficulty lifting his arms above shoulder level, combing his hair or reaching for objects on high shelves. On examination, he has bilateral tenderness over the proximal humerus and limited active range of motion at the shoulder joint.

Which condition should be suspected? 

A. Rotator cuff tear 
B. Frozen shoulder 
C. Shoulder impingement syndrome 
D. Glenohumeral arthritis 
E. Bicipital tendonitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's age, history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, insidious onset, bilateral involvement, pain and stiffness limiting active range of motion suggest frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis).

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents to her GP with a persistent cough and shortness of breath for the past 6 months. She has a history of smoking, but quit 10 years ago. On examination, there are decreased breath sounds on the right side of her chest. A chest X-ray is ordered which shows a suspicious lesion in the lung. Further imaging with CT scan reveals an incidental finding of multiple liver lesions.
What is the most appropriate investigation to determine the nature of these liver lesions? 

A. Liver biopsy
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
C. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan 
D. Abdominal ultrasound 
E. Serum tumour markers

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The most definitive way to diagnose liver lesions is by obtaining tissue samples through biopsy.

Question
A 50-year-old man undergoes routine colonoscopy as part of colorectal cancer screening program and an incidental finding of a large polypoid mass in his rectum is detected during the procedure.
Which feature(s) would suggest that this polyp may be malignant? 

A. Size >2 cm
B. Presence of villous architecture
C. High-grade dysplasia on histopathology
D. Ulceration or bleeding from the surface
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Large size (>2cm), villous architecture, high-grade dysplasia and ulceration/bleeding from surface are all features associated with increased risk of malignancy in colonic polyps.

Question
A 30-year-old female patient undergoes brain MRI for evaluation of chronic headaches and an incidental finding of a small enhancing lesion in the pituitary gland is noted.
Which hormone abnormality should be evaluated first? 

A.Prolactin level 
B.Cortisol level 
C.Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level 
D.Growth hormone (GH) level 
E.Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Prolactinoma is the most common type of pituitary adenoma. Therefore, prolactin levels should be evaluated first in a patient with an incidental finding of a small enhancing lesion in the pituitary gland on MRI.

Question
A 4-month-old infant is brought to the clinic by his parents with a history of recurrent vomiting and poor weight gain since birth. The baby was born at term via normal vaginal delivery, but had difficulty latching onto the breast initially, leading to supplementation with formula feeds. Since then, he has been exclusively formula-fed.

On examination, the baby appears small for his age and has dry skin on his face and scalp. His fontanelle is slightly sunken, and he has decreased skin turgor. Blood tests reveal elevated urea and creatinine levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Congenital heart disease
B. Cystic fibrosis
C. Renal tubular acidosis
D. Cow's milk protein intolerance/allergy
E. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation of recurrent vomiting, poor weight gain, and dry skin in an infant who is exclusively formula-fed suggests cow's milk protein intolerance/allergy as the most likely diagnosis. Elevated urea and creatinine levels suggest dehydration due to persistent vomiting.

Question
A 2-week-old neonate presents with irritability during feeding, excessive crying after feeds, regurgitation of feeds (sometimes projectile), coughing or choking spells while feeding, and frequent hiccups throughout the day. She was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery without any complications.

On examination, she appears healthy with no signs of respiratory distress or cyanosis.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Coeliac disease
B. Lactose intolerance
C. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
D. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
E. Duodenal atresia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The symptoms described are consistent with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in infants - irritability during feeding, excessive crying after feeds, regurgitation of feeds (sometimes projectile), coughing or choking spells while feeding, and frequent hiccups throughout the day. The absence of respiratory distress or cyanosis suggests that GORD is uncomplicated.

Question
A 3-month-old infant presents with a history of recurrent diarrhoea and vomiting since birth. She was born at term via normal vaginal delivery without any complications. She has been exclusively breastfed since birth.

On examination, she appears small for her age and has dry skin on her face and scalp. Her fontanelle is slightly sunken, and she has decreased skin turgor. Blood tests reveal elevated urea and creatinine levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

B. Lactose intolerance
C. Cow's milk protein intolerance/allergy
D. Rotavirus gastroenteritis
E. Cystic fibrosis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation of recurrent diarrhoea and vomiting in an exclusively breastfed infant suggests rotavirus gastroenteritis as the most likely diagnosis. Elevated urea and creatinine levels suggest dehydration due to persistent vomiting and diarrhoea.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a history of decreased fetal movements for the past 24 hours at 36 weeks gestation. On examination, there is no fetal heart rate detected and an ultrasound confirms intrauterine death. The patient has a history of recurrent miscarriages and has undergone multiple investigations in the past including karyotyping, thrombophilia screening, and cervical length measurement which were all normal.

Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Induction of labour
B. Expectant management
C. Caesarean section 
D. Fetal autopsy 
E. Hysterectomy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In cases of intrauterine death, it is important to offer parents the option of fetal autopsy as this can provide valuable information about any underlying cause that may have contributed to the stillbirth.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her obstetrician at 28 weeks gestation with a history of decreased fetal movements over the past week. An ultrasound scan reveals an intrauterine death with evidence of severe growth restriction and placental insufficiency.

Which of the following maternal risk factors is most likely associated with this presentation? 

A. Maternal age >40 years
B. Pre-existing hypertension
C. Previous preterm delivery
D. Multiple pregnancy 
E. Smoking during pregnancy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Pre-existing hypertension is a well-known risk factor for placental insufficiency leading to intrauterine growth restriction and subsequent stillbirth.

Question
A 25-year-old primigravida presents at term in spontaneous labour but on admission there are concerns regarding reduced fetal movements and an abnormal CTG trace suggestive of fetal distress requiring urgent delivery by caesarean section under general anaesthesia due to failed instrumental vaginal delivery attempts.

On delivery, there is evidence of meconium-stained liquor and a stillborn baby is delivered. The placenta shows evidence of chronic villitis.

Which of the following maternal conditions is most likely associated with this presentation? 

A. Systemic lupus erythematosus
B. Gestational diabetes mellitus 
C. Antiphospholipid syndrome 
D. Preeclampsia 
E. Chronic hypertension

D. Wilson's disease 
E. Primary biliary cholangitis 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation along with positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies suggests primary biliary cholangitis as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the labour ward at 39 weeks gestation with a history of prolonged rupture of membranes for over 24 hours and no contractions. On examination, she is found to have a high presenting part and an unfavourable cervix with a Bishop's score of 3. The obstetrician decides to induce labour using oxytocin infusion.

Which of the following is true regarding oxytocin induction? 

A. Oxytocin should be started at a low dose and increased gradually every 30 minutes until adequate uterine activity is achieved.
B. Oxytocin should not be used in women with previous caesarean section.
C. Oxytocin should be stopped if contractions become too frequent or last longer than 90 seconds.
D. Oxytocin can cause water intoxication due to its antidiuretic effect.
E. Oxytocin-induced contractions are usually less painful than spontaneous contractions.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Oxytocin infusion is commonly used for induction of labour in cases where there is prolonged rupture of membranes without any signs of spontaneous onset of labour or other indications such as post-term pregnancy or maternal medical conditions that require delivery. However, it has several potential side effects including water intoxication due to its antidiuretic effect which can lead to hyponatremia, seizures, and even death if not monitored closely.

Question
A primigravida at term presents to the maternity unit with regular painful contractions lasting for more than one minute each time and occurring every five minutes since her waters broke two hours ago. She reports passing meconium-stained liquor earlier this morning but denies any vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain.

On examination, her cervix is fully dilated with fetal head at +1 station on VE (vaginal examination). CTG (cardiotocography) shows a category 2 pattern. The obstetrician decides to proceed with instrumental delivery.

Which of the following is true regarding forceps delivery? 

A. Forceps delivery should be avoided in cases of fetal macrosomia.
B. Maternal bladder should be emptied before performing forceps delivery.
C. Forceps blades should be applied over the occiput and parietal bones.
D. Fetal head position does not affect the choice of forceps blade application.
E. The maximum traction time for each pull during forceps delivery is 5 minutes.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Instrumental vaginal delivery (IVD) using either vacuum extraction or forceps may be indicated when there is failure to progress, non-reassuring fetal status, maternal exhaustion, or other obstetric indications such as breech presentation or maternal medical conditions that require expedited delivery. In cases where forceps are used, it is important to ensure that the maternal bladder is empty to avoid injury and facilitate proper visualization of the perineum and fetal head during the procedure.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents to the labour ward at 41 weeks gestation with regular contractions every three minutes lasting for one minute each time since last night. On examination, her cervix is found to be dilated up to 7cm with good effacement and station -1 on VE (vaginal examination). CTG (cardiotocography) shows a reassuring fetal heart rate pattern.

The patient requests epidural analgesia for pain relief during labour.

Which of the following statements regarding epidural analgesia for labour pain relief is true? 

A. Epidural analgesia can cause hypotension due to sympathetic blockade which can lead to decreased uteroplacental perfusion.
B. Epidural analgesia increases the risk of operative vaginal deliveries such as forceps or vacuum extraction.
C. Epidural analgesia should not be used in women with a history of back surgery or spinal abnormalities.
D. Epidural analgesia can cause urinary retention due to the effect on bladder function.
E. Epidural analgesia does not affect the duration of labour.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Epidural analgesia is a commonly used method for pain relief during labour and delivery. However, it has several potential side effects including hypotension due to sympathetic blockade which can lead to decreased uteroplacental perfusion and fetal distress if not treated promptly. It may also increase the risk of operative vaginal deliveries such as forceps or vacuum extraction due to prolonged second stage of labour. Additionally, epidural analgesia should be avoided in women with a history of back surgery or spinal abnormalities and can cause urinary retention due to its effect on bladder function.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a deep laceration on his left forearm sustained while operating heavy machinery at work. The wound is bleeding profusely and requires immediate attention. On examination, there is no evidence of tendon or nerve involvement but the wound is gaping open.

What are the different types of sutures that can be used for this type of laceration? Discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

A. Monofilament absorbable sutures
B. Multifilament non-absorbable sutures
C. Monofilament non-absorbable sutures
D. Braided absorbable sutures
E. Barbed sutures

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Multifilament non-absorbable sutures have better tensile strength than monofilament absorbable sutures and are less likely to cause tissue reaction compared to braided absorbable sutures. However, they carry a higher risk of infection due to bacterial colonization in the interstices between filaments.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents with a laceration on her forehead after falling down stairs at home. The wound is approximately 3 cm long and has clean edges without any foreign body visible inside it.

What factors should be considered when deciding whether to use adhesive strips or traditional suture closure for this type of laceration? What are the potential complications associated with each method?

A. Age of patient and location of injury
B. Size of wound and presence of foreign body
C. Time since injury occurred and patient's medical history
D. Type of trauma and depth of wound
E. Patient preference and availability of materials

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Adhesive strips may be preferred over traditional suture closure if the wound edges are well approximated, as they provide good cosmetic results without requiring local anesthesia or removal later on, which can be uncomfortable for the patient. However, they may not be appropriate for wounds under tension or in areas of high mobility, as they are less secure than sutures and can result in wound dehiscence. Suture closure may be preferred if there is significant tissue loss or a foreign body present, but carries a risk of infection, scarring, and suture reaction.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a deep laceration on his left hand sustained while using a circular saw at home. On examination, there is evidence of tendon involvement and he is referred to orthopedics for repair.

What factors should be considered when deciding whether to perform primary or delayed tendon repair? What are the potential complications associated with each method?

A. Time since injury occurred and location of injury
B. Age of patient and presence of comorbidities
C. Type of trauma and depth of wound
D. Extent of tendon damage and availability of materials
E. Patient preference and surgeon's experience

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Primary tendon repair should be performed if there is minimal gap between the ends of the severed tendon, no contamination or infection present, and good vascularity at the site of injury. Delayed tendon repair may be necessary if there is extensive tissue loss or contamination that requires debridement before repair can occur, or if there is poor vascularity at the site that needs time to improve before surgery can proceed. Complications associated with both methods include adhesion formation, rupture or gapping at the repair site, nerve damage, and joint stiffness due to immobilization during healing.

Question
A 25-year-old woman with a history of learning disability presents to her GP with concerns about her menstrual cycle. She reports that her periods are irregular and often very heavy, causing significant disruption to her daily life. On further questioning, she reveals that she has been sexually active in the past but is currently not in a relationship. Her medical history is otherwise unremarkable.
Which one of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? 

A. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
B. Endometriosis
C. Fibroids
D. Adenomyosis
E. Cervical cancer

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Women with learning disabilities have an increased risk of reproductive health problems such as menstrual disorders, sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies. PCOS is a common endocrine disorder that affects women of reproductive age and can cause irregular periods, heavy bleeding and other symptoms.

Question
A 10-year-old boy with Down syndrome presents to his paediatrician with recurrent episodes of vomiting and abdominal pain over the past few months. He has lost weight and appears pale on examination.
Which one of the following conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis? 

A. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
B. Coeliac disease
C. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
D. Intestinal obstruction
E. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing gastrointestinal problems such as constipation, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Hirschsprung's disease.

Question
A 30-year-old man with a history of severe learning disability presents to his GP with worsening shortness of breath over the past few weeks associated with coughing up blood-stained sputum. He has a history of recurrent chest infections and is a non-smoker.
Which one of the following conditions is most likely to be responsible for this patient's symptoms? 

A. Pulmonary embolism
B. Pneumonia
C. Tuberculosis (TB)
D. Lung cancer
E. Bronchiectasis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: People with learning disabilities are at increased risk of respiratory problems such as bronchitis, pneumonia and bronchiectasis, which can cause chronic coughing, shortness of breath and recurrent chest infections. Coughing up blood-stained sputum suggests that there may be damage to the airways or lung tissue, which could be due to underlying bronchiectasis.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with bilateral leg pain that occurs after walking for a few minutes and is relieved by rest. He also reports numbness in his feet, particularly at night. His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. On examination, he has absent dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and reduced ankle-brachial index (ABI) readings of 0.6 on the right and 0.5 on the left.

Which one of the following investigations should be performed next? 

A. Magnetic resonance angiography
B. Computed tomography angiography
C. Duplex ultrasonography
D. Arteriogram
E. Venous Doppler

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which can be confirmed by measuring ABI readings or performing duplex ultrasonography to assess blood flow through the arteries in the legs. In this case, given the patient's age and comorbidities, further investigation with computed tomography angiography would be appropriate to identify any significant stenosis or occlusion of the arteries supplying blood to his legs.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with cramping pain in her right calf when walking short distances that resolves within a few minutes of resting. She has a past medical history of smoking and hypertension but no other significant medical conditions.
On examination, she has normal pedal pulses bilaterally but reduced ABI readings of 0.8 on the right and 0.9 on the left.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Vascular claudication 
B. Lumbar spinal stenosis 
C. Osteoarthritis of the hip 
D. Spondylolisthesis 
E.Deep vein thrombosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with vascular claudication, which is caused by reduced blood flow to the muscles in the legs during exercise. The normal pedal pulses suggest that there is no significant arterial stenosis or occlusion, but the reduced ABI readings indicate some degree of peripheral arterial disease.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with severe pain and numbness in his right foot that has been worsening over several weeks. He reports a history of smoking and hypertension but no other significant medical conditions.
On examination, he has absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the right side and a non-healing ulcer on his right foot.

What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Angioplasty with stenting 
B. Aspirin 
C. Balloon angioplasty 
D. Below-knee amputation 
E.Open bypass graft

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest critical limb ischemia (CLI), which is characterized by rest pain, non-healing ulcers, and tissue loss due to inadequate blood supply to the affected limb. In this case, given the absence of distal pulses and presence of an ulcer, below-knee amputation may be necessary to prevent further tissue damage or infection.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a history of progressive weakness in her left arm and leg for the past six months. She also complains of difficulty in speaking and swallowing, along with drooping of her left eyelid. On examination, there is significant wasting of the muscles on the left side of her face, along with decreased power (4/5) in her left upper limb and lower limb. The reflexes are brisk on the affected side, and plantar response is extensor. Sensory examination reveals no abnormalities. MRI scan shows a lesion in the right frontal lobe involving both motor and premotor areas.

A. Multiple sclerosis
B. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
C. Cerebral palsy
D. Stroke

Colonoscopy allows direct visualisation of the colon and biopsy samples can be taken for histological examination.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to his GP with melaena and fatigue over the past few days. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, he appears pale but is otherwise stable.

Which medication could be responsible for his symptoms? 

A. Aspirin
B. Metformin
C. Atorvastatin
D. Ramipril
E. Amlodipine

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversibly blocking cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme activity in platelets. This can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, including melaena, as well as other bleeding complications such as haemorrhagic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage. Patients on long-term aspirin therapy should be monitored for signs of bleeding and their dose adjusted accordingly if necessary.

Explanation: The use of a fan in the baby's room for ventilation has been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS by improving air circulation and reducing rebreathing of carbon dioxide around the infant's face.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of weakness in her legs. She reports that she had a viral illness two weeks ago and has since been experiencing fatigue and malaise. On examination, there is decreased power in both lower limbs, with areflexia and sensory loss up to the mid-thigh level. There is also mild proximal muscle weakness in the upper limbs.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP)
B. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)
C. Myasthenia gravis
D. Lambert-Eaton syndrome
E. Polymyositis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), which is a subtype of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS). The preceding viral illness suggests an autoimmune response triggered by molecular mimicry between viral antigens and peripheral nerve components, leading to inflammation and demyelination of peripheral nerves.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with progressive difficulty walking over the past year, associated with falls and frequent tripping on uneven surfaces. He also reports difficulty lifting objects above his head or climbing stairs without assistance from his arms.

On examination, there is marked wasting of the shoulder girdle muscles and scapular winging bilaterally, as well as moderate weakness of hip flexion and knee extension bilaterally.

Which investigation would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?

A. Creatine kinase levels
B. Electromyography (EMG) testing
C. Muscle biopsy
D. Genetic testing for muscular dystrophies
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical features are consistent with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), which is a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders affecting the proximal muscles of the limbs. Genetic testing for LGMD can help identify specific mutations in genes encoding structural proteins or enzymes involved in muscle metabolism, which can guide prognosis and management.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents with fluctuating weakness and fatigue that worsens throughout the day, particularly after prolonged activity. She reports difficulty chewing and swallowing solid foods, as well as slurred speech and double vision when fatigued.

On examination, there is bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, as well as mild weakness of facial expression and neck flexion. There is also moderate weakness of shoulder abduction and hip flexion bilaterally.

Which test would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?

A. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies
B. Muscle biopsy
C. Nerve conduction studies
D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brainstem
E. Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder characterized by neuromuscular junction dysfunction due to acetylcholine receptor antibodies or other synaptic proteins targeted by autoantibodies. Testing for acetylcholine receptor antibodies can confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment options such as cholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressive therapy.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with a history of night sweats, weight loss and fatigue for the past 6 months. He has no significant medical history but is an ex-smoker. On examination, he has hepatosplenomegaly and palpable lymph nodes in his neck, axilla and groin. Investigations reveal pancytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and bone marrow biopsy shows infiltration by large atypical cells with abundant cytoplasm and irregular nuclei.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Hodgkin's Lymphoma
B. Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
C. Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia
D. Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
E. Multiple Myeloma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of lymphoma with systemic symptoms such as night sweats, weight loss and fatigue along with hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy on examination. Pancytopenia may also be seen due to bone marrow involvement by the malignant cells. Elevated LDH levels are often seen in aggressive lymphomas like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which can present with extranodal disease involving multiple sites including liver, spleen or bone marrow.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of night sweats for the past month along with intermittent fever, cough and shortness of breath on exertion for the past week. She denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts but reports having unprotected sex with multiple partners over the past year.

On examination, she appears unwell with tachypnoea and bilateral crackles on lung auscultation.

Which of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Blood cultures 
B. Sputum culture 
C. Tuberculin skin test 
D. HIV serology 
E. Chest X-ray 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of a possible infectious cause for her symptoms with fever, cough and shortness of breath along with night sweats. Given the history of unprotected sex with multiple partners, an HIV test should be performed as it can present with similar symptoms including pulmonary manifestations like pneumocystis pneumonia or tuberculosis which can also cause night sweats.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of night sweats and weight loss over the past few months. He has no significant medical history but reports having smoked heavily for the past 40 years.

On examination, he appears cachectic and has clubbing of fingers on both hands. Investigations reveal elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels and chest X-ray shows a right upper lobe mass.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Lung cancer
B. Mesothelioma
C. Tuberculosis
D. Sarcoidosis
E. Pulmonary fibrosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of lung cancer with constitutional symptoms like night sweats and weight loss along with smoking history being a major risk factor for developing lung cancer. Clubbing may also be seen in advanced cases due to paraneoplastic syndrome associated with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels may indicate bone metastasis while chest X-ray findings are consistent with a primary tumour in the right upper lobe which can cause localised sweating due to autonomic dysfunction caused by tumour invasion into sympathetic ganglia or nerves supplying sweat glands in that area.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a complaint of bilateral nipple discharge for the past two months. She reports that the discharge is watery and has no blood or pus in it. She denies any history of breast pain, lump, or trauma. Her menstrual cycles are regular, and she has had three normal pregnancies in the past. On examination, there is no palpable mass in either breast, but both nipples show a clear fluid on expression.

Which one of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? 

A. Intraductal papilloma
B. Mammary duct ectasia
C. Breast carcinoma
D. Prolactinoma
E. Idiopathic galactorrhea

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The absence of any palpable mass or abnormality on imaging makes intraductal papilloma, mammary duct ectasia, and breast carcinoma unlikely causes for this patient's bilateral nipple discharge. Given her regular menstrual cycles and lack of other hormonal symptoms such as hirsutism or acne, prolactinoma is also an unlikely diagnosis. Idiopathic galactorrhea can be caused by stress, medications like antidepressants or antipsychotics, or even just stimulation of the breasts during sexual activity without lactation occurring.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to her gynecologist with complaints of milky white nipple discharge from both breasts over the last six months since giving birth to her first child via C-section delivery. She reports that the discharge occurs spontaneously throughout the day and night without any provocation and sometimes soaks through her clothing requiring frequent changes throughout the day.

Which one of the following conditions could account for this patient's presentation? 

A. Intraductal papilloma 
B. Mammary duct ectasia 
C. Lactating adenoma 
D. Pituitary adenoma 
E. Breast carcinoma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history of recent childbirth and lactation, along with the spontaneous milky white nipple discharge, suggests a hormonal etiology for her symptoms. Pituitary adenomas can cause hyperprolactinemia leading to milk production in non-lactating women or excessive milk production in lactating women. Intraductal papilloma and mammary duct ectasia are more commonly associated with bloody or serous nipple discharge rather than milky white discharge. Lactating adenomas are benign tumors that can occur during pregnancy or lactation but typically present as a palpable mass rather than isolated nipple discharge. Breast carcinoma is unlikely given the patient's young age and absence of other concerning features on examination.

Question
A 55-year-old postmenopausal woman presents to her GP with complaints of a lump in her left breast and occasional greenish-brown nipple discharge from the same side over the last few weeks. She reports no family history of breast cancer, no previous breast surgeries, and no use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). On examination, there is a firm, irregularly shaped mass measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter located at the upper outer quadrant of her left breast.

Which one of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation? 

A. Fibroadenosis
B. Duct papilloma
C. Mammary duct ectasia 
D. Invasive ductal carcinoma 
E. Lobular carcinoma in situ

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of an irregularly shaped mass along with greenish-brown nipple discharge raises concern for malignancy; however, invasive ductal carcinoma would be less likely to present with such color changes in the nipple discharge compared to duct papilloma which may have necrotic debris within it causing discoloration. Fibroadenosis is a benign condition that can cause breast lumps but does not typically present with nipple discharge. Mammary duct ectasia may present with greenish-brown nipple discharge, but the absence of any palpable mass makes it less likely in this case. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is an incidental finding on biopsy and would not typically present with a palpable mass or nipple discharge.

Question
A 36-year-old woman presents to her obstetrician at 32 weeks gestation with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) during her pregnancy. She has been treated with antibiotics for each episode and is currently asymptomatic. Her blood pressure is within normal limits, and the fundal height corresponds to the gestational age. Urine dipstick test shows nitrites positive, leukocytes positive, protein negative, and glucose negative.

What would be your next step in managing this patient? Consider the risks associated with UTIs during pregnancy and their potential complications.

A. Prescribe prophylactic antibiotics until delivery
B. Order a urine culture and sensitivity test
C. Refer the patient to a urologist for further evaluation
D. Perform an ultrasound scan to assess renal function
E. Advise increased fluid intake

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of nitrites and leukocytes on urine dipstick suggests a high likelihood of bacterial infection in the urinary tract, which can lead to pyelonephritis if left untreated or inadequately treated during pregnancy. Therefore, it is important to confirm the diagnosis by ordering a urine culture and sensitivity test before initiating antibiotic therapy.

Question
A 28-year-old primigravida at 38 weeks gestation presents to labour ward with regular contractions every five minutes lasting for one minute each time over the past hour that are increasing in intensity. She reports no vaginal bleeding or leakage of amniotic fluid but complains of lower back pain that radiates down both legs.

On examination, she appears uncomfortable but alert and oriented; vital signs are stable except for mild tachycardia (110 bpm). Abdominal examination reveals uterine contractions every five minutes lasting for approximately one minute each time; fetal heart rate tracing is reassuring.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms? What would be your initial management? 

A. Preterm labour; administer tocolytic therapy
B. False labour; reassure and discharge home
C. Placental abruption; perform emergency caesarean section
D. Normal labour; admit for delivery planning
E. Urinary tract infection; prescribe antibiotics

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with normal labour, which is defined as regular uterine contractions leading to cervical dilatation and effacement resulting in the birth of a viable fetus after 37 weeks gestation. Therefore, she should be admitted for further assessment and delivery planning.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents at 12 weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding that started two days ago and has been progressively increasing in amount since then. She reports no abdominal pain or fever but feels weak and dizzy on standing up.

On examination, her vital signs are stable except for mild tachycardia (100 bpm). Abdominal examination reveals a uterus corresponding to 12 weeks gestational age with tenderness on palpation over the lower abdomen.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What investigations would you order? What would be your initial management? 

A. Missed miscarriage; order transvaginal ultrasound scan; offer expectant management or surgical evacuation depending on findings
B. Ectopic pregnancy; order serum beta-hCG level, transvaginal ultrasound scan, and consider referral to gynaecologist for laparoscopy if indicated 
C. Molar pregnancy; order serum beta-hCG level, pelvic ultrasound scan, chest X-ray, and refer to specialist centre for further evaluation 
D. Cervical ectropion; order speculum examination and swabs for culture/sensitivity testing 
E. Placenta previa; order transabdominal ultrasound scan and prepare for possible blood transfusion

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and signs are suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires urgent diagnosis and management. Therefore, serum beta-hCG level should be ordered to confirm the presence of pregnancy, followed by transvaginal ultrasound scan to locate the gestational sac and assess for any evidence of rupture or bleeding. If indicated, referral to a gynaecologist for laparoscopy may be necessary to manage this condition.

Question
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with complaints of decreased urine output for the past two days.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a painful swollen leg that has been gradually worsening over the past week. He reports no recent trauma or injury, but does have a history of smoking and hypertension. On examination, his left leg is warm, tender, and significantly larger in circumference than his right leg. There is pitting edema up to the mid-thigh level and palpation elicits pain throughout the entire limb. The patient's vital signs are stable.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Deep vein thrombosis
B. Cellulitis 
C. Acute arterial occlusion 
D. Lymphedema 
E. Venous insufficiency

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Given the patient's risk factors and clinical presentation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) should be suspected as the most likely diagnosis. DVT occurs when a blood clot forms within one of the deep veins in the body, typically in the lower extremities. Symptoms include swelling, warmth, tenderness, and pain in the affected area. Risk factors for DVT include immobility, surgery or trauma to an extremity, cancer, hormonal therapy such as oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, smoking, and obesity.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of recurrent episodes of unilateral leg swelling accompanied by mild discomfort over several months duration which usually resolves on its own after few days without any treatment intervention required from her side except rest at home during those days.

On examination there was no redness or heat noted over her calf region however it was found to be mildly tender on palpation compared to other side with no significant difference in circumference between both legs.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A) Refer for urgent Doppler ultrasound scan.
B) Prescribe anticoagulant medication.
C) Advise rest and observe.
D) Prescribe diuretics.
E) Refer for urgent MRI scan.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the absence of redness or heat makes cellulitis less likely. Therefore, an urgent Doppler ultrasound scan should be arranged to confirm or exclude DVT as the cause of her symptoms. 

Question
A 58-year-old man presents with sudden onset severe pain in his left leg that started while he was walking up stairs at home. He reports no recent trauma or injury, but does have a history of smoking and high cholesterol levels. On examination, his left leg is cold, pale and pulseless below the knee level with significant swelling extending up to mid-thigh level. There is marked tenderness throughout the entire limb on palpation.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A) Arrange immediate fasciotomy
B) Start anticoagulant medication immediately 
C) Perform arterial duplex scan 
D) Apply compression stockings 
E) Keep the leg elevated and apply ice packs

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Given the patient's risk factors and clinical presentation, acute arterial occlusion should be suspected as the most likely diagnosis. Arterial duplex scan can help confirm or exclude this diagnosis by assessing blood flow through the affected artery. Immediate intervention such as surgical revascularization may be necessary depending on severity of ischemia detected during imaging studies.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe fatigue, shortness of breath and pallor for the past few weeks. He has a history of Crohn's disease and is on treatment with infliximab. On examination, he appears pale, his blood pressure is low and heart rate is elevated. Laboratory investigations reveal anaemia (haemoglobin level of 70 g/L), thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 40 x 10^9/L) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Iron deficiency anaemia
B. Megaloblastic anaemia
C. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
D. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
E. Sickle cell anaemia

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is characterized by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological symptoms, renal failure and fever in some cases. Schistocytes are often seen on peripheral blood smears due to mechanical destruction of red blood cells as they pass through small vessels occluded by platelet-fibrin aggregates.

Question

Treatment typically involves antipsychotic medications to reduce positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, as well as negative symptoms such as social withdrawal and apathy.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with a history of severe pruritus, which has been ongoing for the past six months. He reports that the itching is worse at night and affects his entire body. On examination, he has multiple excoriation marks but no other significant findings. His blood tests show elevated liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels. An ultrasound scan reveals dilated bile ducts.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's pruritus? 

A. Cholangiocarcinoma
B. Primary biliary cholangitis
C. Hepatitis B infection 
D. Alcoholic liver disease 
E. Autoimmune hepatitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical picture is suggestive of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), an autoimmune disease characterised by chronic inflammation and destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts leading to cholestasis and pruritus.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents with a two-week history of intense pruritus on her arms, legs, and trunk associated with small red bumps that appear in crops over several days. She denies any recent travel or new medications but admits to having unprotected sexual intercourse with a new partner three weeks ago.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Scabies infestation 
B. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome 
C. Pityriasis rosea 
D. Erythema multiforme 
E. Secondary syphilis 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests secondary syphilis, which typically occurs 2-8 weeks after initial infection and manifests as widespread maculopapular rash accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, headache, and lymphadenopathy.

Question
A 55-year-old male presents with persistent pruritus for the past year affecting his back and scalp primarily but also involving other areas intermittently. He has tried various over-the-counter creams and shampoos without much relief. On examination, there are no significant findings except for excoriation marks on the back and scalp.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Lichen planus 
B. Psoriasis 
C. Seborrheic dermatitis 
D. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
E. Dermatomyositis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical picture is suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterised by erythematous plaques with greasy scales affecting areas rich in sebaceous glands such as the scalp, face, chest, and back.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset ptosis and diplopia in his left eye. He reports a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking for over 30 years. On examination, he has complete ptosis of the left eyelid and limitation of upward gaze in the same eye. The pupil is dilated and non-reactive to light. MRI reveals an acute infarct involving the midbrain.

Which artery is most likely occluded in this patient? 

A. Anterior cerebral artery
B. Basilar artery
C. Middle cerebral artery
D. Posterior communicating artery
E. Vertebral artery

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) supplies the levator palpebrae superioris muscle that elevates the upper eyelid, as well as other muscles that control eye movements and pupillary constriction. An acute oculomotor nerve palsy with ptosis, mydriasis, and limited extraocular movement suggests an ischemic injury or compression along its course through the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure into the orbit itself. In this case, involvement of the posterior communicating artery would be consistent with a midbrain infarction due to its close proximity to the oculomotor nerve.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents with bilateral ptosis that worsens throughout the day and improves after restful sleep at night. She also complains of fatigue, weakness in her limbs, difficulty swallowing solid foods but not liquids, and occasional double vision when looking up or to either side.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Botulism 
B. Congenital myasthenic syndrome 
C. Eaton-Lambert syndrome 
D. Myotonic dystrophy 
E. Ocular myasthenia gravis 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) is a subtype of myasthenia gravis that affects the extraocular muscles and levator palpebrae superioris muscle. It presents with fluctuating ptosis, diplopia, and weakness of eye movements that worsen throughout the day or after prolonged use. Fatigue and weakness in other skeletal muscles may also occur but are usually milder than in generalized myasthenia gravis. Botulism can cause similar symptoms but is typically associated with symmetric descending paralysis, cranial nerve palsies, and absence of sensory deficits.

Question
A 48-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of drooping eyelids that have been present for several months. He reports no history of trauma or surgery around the eyes, no double vision or pain, and no other neurological symptoms. On examination, he has bilateral ptosis that improves slightly on sustained upgaze.

What test would be most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis? 

A. Acetylcholine receptor antibody assay 
B. Electromyography 
C. Ice pack test 
D. Tensilon test 
E. Visual field testing 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The ice pack test involves applying an ice pack to one eyelid for two minutes followed by assessing any improvement in ptosis compared to the contralateral side over five minutes. This simple bedside test can help differentiate between myogenic causes of ptosis such as myotonic dystrophy or mitochondrial disorders from neuromuscular junction disorders such as ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG). In OMG, cooling reduces acetylcholinesterase activity at the neuromuscular junction leading to increased availability of acetylcholine receptors resulting in improved muscle strength and reduced ptosis within 2-5 minutes after removal of the ice pack.

Question
A 14-year-old girl presents to her GP with concerns about delayed puberty. She reports having no breast development or pubic hair growth, and has not yet started menstruating. On examination, she is found to have a BMI of 16kg/mÂ² and is significantly shorter than average for her age.

Further investigations reveal low levels of oestrogen, LH, FSH, and AMH. An MRI scan shows that the patient's pituitary gland is smaller than normal.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Turner's syndrome
B. Kallmann syndrome
C. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
D. Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction
E. Androgen insensitivity syndrome

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The combination of delayed puberty, lack of secondary sexual characteristics, low hormone levels, and a small pituitary gland on imaging strongly suggests Kallmann syndrome - a genetic condition in which the hypothalamus fails to produce sufficient GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone), leading to reduced sex hormone production and delayed puberty.

Question
A 13-year-old boy presents with gynaecomastia - enlargement of his breast tissue - which he finds embarrassing and distressing.

On examination, the boy appears otherwise healthy but has significant bilateral breast enlargement without any other signs of feminisation or virilisation.

What is the most likely cause of this presentation? 

A. Testicular cancer 
B. Hyperthyroidism 
C. Obesity 
D. Idiopathic gynaecomastia 
E. Pituitary adenoma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In adolescent boys, gynaecomastia is usually idiopathic (of unknown cause) and resolves spontaneously within two years in around 90% of cases.

Question
A 16-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhoea - she has never had a period. She reports normal breast development and pubic hair growth, but has no axillary hair.

On examination, she is found to have a BMI of 22kg/mÂ² and is significantly taller than average for her age.

Investigations reveal elevated levels of testosterone and DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate), as well as an ovarian cyst on ultrasound.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Polycystic ovary syndrome 
B. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
C. Androgen insensitivity syndrome 
D. Turner's syndrome 
E. Premature ovarian failure

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The combination of primary amenorrhoea, elevated androgens, and an ovarian cyst suggests congenital adrenal hyperplasia - a group of genetic disorders that affect the production of steroid hormones by the adrenal glands.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent episodes of purpura for the past year. She reports that these episodes are associated with joint pain, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. On examination, palpable purpura is present on her lower limbs and buttocks, along with mild tenderness in multiple joints. Investigations reveal elevated inflammatory markers and positive stool cultures for enteric pathogens. A skin biopsy shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Henoch-Schonlein purpura 
B. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) 
C. Cryoglobulinemia-associated vasculitis 
D. Behcet's disease 
E. Microscopic polyangitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest an underlying systemic vasculitis, which can be confirmed by skin biopsy showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The presence of joint pain, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea suggests cryoglobulinemia-associated vasculitis as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with a complaint of easy bruising over the past few months despite no significant trauma or injury. He also reports fatigue and weight loss over the same period of time. On examination, there are multiple petechiae and ecchymoses on his arms and legs without any other significant findings on physical exam or laboratory investigations except thrombocytopaenia.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A.Thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP)
B.Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML)
C.Child abuse
D.Essential thrombocythaemia
E.Idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presentation of easy bruising, fatigue and weight loss in an elderly patient with thrombocytopaenia is concerning for a myeloproliferative neoplasm such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Further investigations including bone marrow biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of purpura on her lower limbs associated with joint pain and abdominal pain. She reports that these episodes occur every few months and are usually self-limiting but have been increasing in frequency over the past year. On examination, there are palpable purpura on her lower limbs along with mild tenderness in multiple joints. Investigations reveal elevated inflammatory markers and positive stool cultures for enteric pathogens.
What is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. High-dose corticosteroids 
B. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 
C. Plasmapheresis 
D. Azathioprine 
E. Observation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest an underlying systemic vasculitis, which can be confirmed by skin biopsy showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis. However, since her symptoms are self-limiting and not severe at this time, observation would be the most appropriate initial management strategy while monitoring for any progression or worsening of symptoms that may require more aggressive treatment options like high-dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents like azathioprine or IVIG therapy if needed later on.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with a history of rectal prolapse for the past year, which has been progressively worsening. He reports difficulty in defecation and occasional fecal incontinence. On examination, you note that he has a full-thickness rectal prolapse measuring approximately 8 cm in length. You decide to perform a transanal repair using a Delorme's procedure.

Which of the following is true regarding the Delorme's procedure? 

A. It involves excision of the redundant mucosa and submucosa from the anterior wall of the rectum
B. It involves plication of the muscularis propria layer of the rectum
C. It is contraindicated in patients with significant comorbidities
D. It carries a high risk of recurrence compared to other surgical options
E. It may be complicated by postoperative urinary retention

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 35 weeks gestation with decreased fetal movements for the past 12 hours. She reports that she has not felt any kicks or movements from her baby during this time period, which is unusual as she usually feels frequent movements throughout the day. The obstetrician performs a non-stress test and observes a baseline fetal heart rate of 120 bpm with no accelerations or decelerations. An ultrasound reveals oligohydramnios and a biophysical profile score of 4 out of 10. What is the most likely cause of these findings? 

A. Placental insufficiency
B. Maternal dehydration 
C. Fetal congenital anomaly 
D. Uterine rupture 
E. Intrauterine growth restriction

Correct Answer: A 

Explanation: Decreased fetal movement in combination with oligohydramnios and an abnormal biophysical profile score suggests placental insufficiency, which can lead to reduced oxygen supply to the fetus resulting in hypoxia.

Question
A 29-year-old primigravida at 38 weeks gestation presents to labor ward complaining of reduced fetal movements over the last few days along with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding for one day. On examination, there are no contractions noted but there is tenderness on palpation over the uterus and mild cervical effacement noted on speculum examination. Ultrasound shows intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) with absent end-diastolic flow on Doppler studies of umbilical artery velocity waveform analysis (UAVWA). What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Abruptio placentae
B. Preterm labor
C. Placenta previa
D. Chorioamnionitis
E. Antepartum hemorrhage

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness and IUGR with absent end-diastolic flow on UAVWA suggests abruptio placentae. 

Question
A 36-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 28 weeks gestation complaining of reduced fetal movements for the past week. She reports that she has not felt any kicks or movements from her baby during this time period, which is unusual as she usually feels frequent movements throughout the day. On examination, there are no contractions noted but a non-stress test reveals decreased variability in fetal heart rate with no accelerations or decelerations. Ultrasound shows normal amniotic fluid volume and growth parameters consistent with gestational age. What is the most likely cause? 

A. Maternal anxiety 
B. Fetal sleep cycle
C. Placental insufficiency 
D. Uterine fibroids 
E. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy

Correct Answer: C 

Explanation: Decreased fetal movement in combination with decreased variability in fetal heart rate suggests placental insufficiency which can lead to reduced oxygen supply to the fetus resulting in hypoxia and decreased activity levels of the fetus.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with a hypertrophic scar on her abdomen following a caesarean section delivery.

The results show that he has detrusor overactivity and impaired bladder contractility with a post-void residual volume of 250 ml.

What is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient? 

A. Alpha-blocker therapy
B. Anticholinergic medication
C. Combination alpha-blocker and anticholinergic therapy
D. Surgery - transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
E. Watchful waiting

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient has symptoms consistent with BPH complicated by detrusor overactivity and impaired bladder contractility which may result in incomplete emptying of the bladder leading to recurrent UTIs, renal impairment, etc., if left untreated. Combination therapy with an alpha-blocker and an anticholinergic agent can improve symptoms by relaxing smooth muscle tone in both the prostate gland and bladder neck while reducing detrusor overactivity.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of recurrent episodes of dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, malaise and fever over the past year despite several courses of antibiotics prescribed by different doctors without any improvement in her symptoms.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent vaginal discharge over the past year. She reports that the discharge is white in color, has an unpleasant odor and is associated with mild itching. She denies any recent sexual activity or use of antibiotics. On examination, there are no external genital lesions or erythema noted. The vulva appears normal, and there is no cervical excitation on bimanual examination.

Which of the following investigations would be most useful for establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Vaginal pH measurement
B. Wet mount microscopy
C. Culture for Candida species 
D. Serological testing for syphilis 
E. PCR testing for Mycoplasma genitalium

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms and signs, bacterial vaginosis (BV) should be considered as one of the possible diagnoses. BV is characterized by an increase in anaerobic bacteria and a decrease in lactobacilli leading to an elevated vaginal pH (>4.5), malodorous thin grey-white discharge adherent to the vaginal walls, and clue cells seen on wet mount microscopy. While other tests may also be helpful in certain situations (e.g., culture for candida species if thrush suspected), wet mount microscopy remains the first-line investigation when assessing patients with vaginal discharge.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents with a complaint of persistent vaginal discharge that has been present for several months now despite multiple courses of treatment with oral metronidazole and topical clindamycin cream prescribed by her GP.

On further questioning, she describes her symptoms as being yellow-greenish in colour with an offensive fishy smell which worsens after intercourse but not associated with any pain or pruritus.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Trichomonas vaginalis infection
B. Chlamydia trachomatis infection
C. Gonorrhoea infection
D. Recurrent bacterial vaginosis 
E. Atrophic vaginitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is a common cause of vaginal discharge in women of reproductive age and is characterized by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, leading to a malodorous thin grey-white discharge adherent to the vaginal walls, elevated vaginal pH (>4.5), and clue cells seen on wet mount microscopy. Treatment with oral metronidazole or topical clindamycin cream is usually effective; however, up to 30% of patients may experience recurrence within three months.

Question
A 26-year-old female presents with a complaint of persistent vaginal discharge that has been present for several weeks now despite treatment with fluconazole prescribed by her GP.

On further questioning, she describes her symptoms as being white in colour without any offensive smell but associated with severe itching which worsens at night.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Bacterial vaginosis 
B. Trichomonas vaginalis infection
C. Candidiasis 
D. Pelvic inflammatory disease
E. Cervical cancer

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of candidiasis (thrush). Candidiasis is a common cause of symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in women and is characterized by thick white curd-like discharge, intense pruritus, erythema, and edema of the vulva and vagina mucosa without any foul odor or cervical excitation on bimanual examination. Fluconazole is usually effective in treating VVC; however, some cases may require prolonged therapy or alternative antifungal agents if resistance develops or there are other underlying factors such as diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression.

Question
A 56-year-old woman presents to the gynaecology clinic with a history of vaginal prolapse for several years. She has tried conservative management, including pelvic floor exercises and pessaries, but her symptoms have not improved. On examination, she is found to have stage III uterine prolapse with significant descent of the cervix beyond the introitus. The patient is keen on surgical intervention and wishes to know more about the different options available.

Which of the following surgical procedures would be most suitable for this patient? 

A. Vaginal hysterectomy with anterior colporrhaphy
B. Laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy 
C. Transvaginal mesh repair 
D. Abdominal sacral colpopexy 
E. Posterior colpoperineorrhaphy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In patients with advanced uterine prolapse, abdominal sacral colpopexy is considered as one of the best treatment options due to its high success rates and low recurrence rates compared to other surgical procedures such as vaginal hysterectomy or transvaginal mesh repair.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe vomiting and abdominal pain. He reports that he has been experiencing these symptoms for the past week, along with a loss of appetite and weight loss. On examination, his abdomen is tender in the epigastric region, and there is no evidence of jaundice or hepatosplenomegaly.

Further investigations reveal elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, as well as an obstructive pattern on liver function tests. An ultrasound scan shows dilated intrahepatic bile ducts and a distended gallbladder.

Given this information, what is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acute pancreatitis
B. Cholecystitis
C. Gastric outlet obstruction
D. Hepatitis B infection
E. Peptic ulcer disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute cholecystitis, which typically presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea/vomiting, and leukocytosis. Elevated serum amylase/lipase levels can indicate pancreatic involvement but are not specific to pancreatitis alone; however, an obstructive pattern on liver function tests suggests biliary tract obstruction due to inflammation or stones in the gallbladder/ducts. Ultrasound findings of dilated bile ducts and a distended gallbladder further support this diagnosis.


Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of recurrent episodes of vomiting over the past month associated with bloating and early satiety after meals. She denies any significant weight loss or change in bowel habits but reports feeling fatigued and generally unwell.

On examination, she appears pale but otherwise normal; there are no palpable masses or tenderness on abdominal palpation.

Investigations show microcytic hypochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 9 g/dL), elevated serum gastrin levels, and a positive Helicobacter pylori serology.

Given this information, what is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Coeliac disease
B. Gastric cancer
C. Gastroparesis
D. Peptic ulcer disease
E. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), which is caused by a gastrin-secreting tumour in the pancreas or duodenum leading to excessive acid secretion and peptic ulcers. Symptoms include recurrent vomiting, abdominal pain/bloating, diarrhoea, weight loss, and anaemia due to chronic blood loss from ulcers. Elevated serum gastrin levels are diagnostic of ZES; however, other causes of hypergastrinaemia such as H.pylori infection should be ruled out first.


Question
A 62-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of persistent vomiting over the past month associated with dysphagia for solids and liquids, weight loss, and fatigue.

On examination, he appears cachectic with visible wasting of muscle mass; there is no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Investigations show normocytic normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 10 g/dL), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals a large ulcerated mass in the oesophagus obstructing the lumen.

Given this information, what is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Achalasia
B. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
C. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma
D. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma
E. Zenker's diverticulum

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which typically presents with dysphagia, weight loss, and fatigue due to malnutrition. Other symptoms include chest pain, hoarseness, coughing up blood, and vomiting. Normocytic normochromic anaemia can indicate chronic inflammation or bleeding from the tumour; elevated CRP levels suggest systemic inflammation. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing OSCC, which appears as an ulcerated mass obstructing the lumen of the oesophagus.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with a six-month history of vulval itching and burning sensation. She has tried several over-the-counter creams, but the symptoms persist.

Question
A 55-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department with chest pain and shortness of breath. On examination, he appears pale and diaphoretic. His blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation on room air is 88%. An ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 consistent with an inferior wall myocardial infarction. While preparing for urgent reperfusion therapy, the patient suddenly becomes unresponsive and pulseless. CPR is initiated immediately by the team.

After two minutes of CPR, a rhythm check reveals asystole on the cardiac monitor. The team continues CPR while considering other interventions. Which of the following interventions should be considered at this point? 

A. Administration of intravenous adrenaline
B. Administration of intravenous amiodarone
C. Defibrillation
D. Transcutaneous pacing
E. Insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In patients with asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), administration of intravenous adrenaline every 3-5 minutes during CPR can improve coronary perfusion pressure and increase the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Intravenous amiodarone may be considered if ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia are present but not in asystole or PEA rhythms. Defibrillation is not indicated in asystole since there is no shockable rhythm present. Transcutaneous pacing may be considered if bradycardia or complete heart block are present but not in asystole or PEA rhythms. Insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump may be considered later in management after ROSC has been achieved to provide hemodynamic support.

Question
A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking is admitted to the hospital for an elective coronary angiography. During the procedure, he develops chest pain and ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4 on ECG consistent with anterior wall myocardial infarction. The interventional cardiologist decides to proceed with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, during the procedure, the patient suddenly becomes unresponsive and pulseless. CPR is initiated immediately by the team.

After two minutes of CPR, a rhythm check reveals ventricular fibrillation on the cardiac monitor. Defibrillation is performed successfully, but the patient remains pulseless. Which of the following interventions should be considered at this point? 

A. Administration of intravenous adrenaline
B. Administration of intravenous amiodarone
C. Transcutaneous pacing
D. Insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump
E. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defibrillation should be performed promptly followed by administration of intravenous adrenaline every 3-5 minutes during CPR to improve coronary perfusion pressure and increase the likelihood of ROSC. Intravenous amiodarone may also be administered after defibrillation if there is no response to initial doses of adrenaline or if recurrent arrhythmias occur during resuscitation efforts. Transcutaneous pacing may be considered if bradycardia or complete heart block are present but not in ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia rhythms. Insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump may be considered later in management after ROSC has been achieved to provide hemodynamic support. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is not indicated acutely during cardiac arrest but may be considered later in management after stabilization of the patient's condition.

Question
A 70-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and previous myocardial infarction is admitted to the hospital for worsening angina.

After two minutes of CPR, a rhythm check reveals pulseless electrical activity (PEA) on the cardiac monitor. The team continues CPR while considering other interventions. Which of the following interventions should be considered at this point? 

A. Administration of intravenous adrenaline
B. Administration of intravenous amiodarone
C. Defibrillation
D. Transcutaneous pacing
E. Insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In patients with PEA or asystole, administration of intravenous adrenaline every 3-5 minutes during CPR can improve coronary perfusion pressure and increase the likelihood of ROSC. Intravenous amiodarone may be considered if ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia are present but not in PEA or asystole rhythms. Defibrillation is not indicated in PEA or asystole since there is no shockable rhythm present. Transcutaneous pacing may be considered if bradycardia or complete heart block are present but not in PEA or asystole rhythms. Insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump may be considered later in management after ROSC has been achieved to provide hemodynamic support.

She describes feeling lightheaded during these episodes but denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Her medical history includes asthma treated with salbutamol inhalers only when needed, and she takes no other medications regularly. Physical examination is unremarkable except for an irregularly irregular pulse at a rate of 140 beats per minute.
Which one of the following tests would be most helpful in establishing the diagnosis? 

A. Ambulatory ECG monitoring 
B. Cardiac MRI 
C. Exercise stress test 
D. Electrophysiological study 
E. Transesophageal echocardiography

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion that have been gradually worsening over the last few months. He has no significant medical history but is a heavy smoker and drinks alcohol regularly. On examination, his blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, heart rate is regular at 70 beats per minute, and there are no murmurs or gallops heard on auscultation. An ECG reveals sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and ST-T wave changes in leads V5-6.
Which one of the following arrhythmias is this patient most likely to develop? 

A. Atrial flutter 
B. Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia 
C. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia 
D. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia 
E. Ventricular fibrillation 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's risk factors for developing malignant arrhythmias include smoking, alcohol use, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ST-T wave changes on ECG suggestive of myocardial ischemia or infarction. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia that can occur in patients with these risk factors and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of new-onset palpitations or syncope episodes.

Question
A 65-year-old female presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, and constipation for the past week. She has a history of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and underwent prophylactic colectomy at age 40. On examination, there is diffuse tenderness on palpation of her abdomen, and a CT scan reveals a large tumour in the rectum that appears to have perforated into the peritoneal cavity.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Metastatic colorectal cancer
B. Adenocarcinoma arising from residual rectal tissue 
C. Desmoid tumour 
D. Carcinoid tumour 
E. Gastrointestinal stromal tumour

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Patients with FAP are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer due to multiple polyps in their colon and rectum. Prophylactic surgery can reduce this risk but does not eliminate it entirely, as residual tissue may still develop malignancy later in life.

MRA is a non-invasive technique that can provide detailed images of the cranial arteries affected by GCA, such as the temporal, occipital, and ophthalmic arteries. It is particularly useful for detecting early-stage disease before irreversible visual loss occurs.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe pain and swelling in his right leg after a fall from a height. On examination, there is tenderness, tightness, and swelling in the anterior compartment of the right leg. The patient has no distal neurovascular deficit at this time. The initial compartment pressure reading is within normal limits but serial measurements show an increasing trend over time. Despite conservative management, the patient's symptoms worsen and he develops numbness and weakness in his foot.

Which of the following statements regarding compartment syndrome is true? 

A. Compartment syndrome can only occur in closed fractures.
B. Pain out of proportion to injury is always present in compartment syndrome.
C. Fasciotomy should be performed immediately if compartment pressures exceed 30 mmHg.
D. Delayed presentation beyond 6 hours rules out the possibility of developing compartment syndrome.
E. Compartment syndrome can never lead to permanent nerve damage.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Pain out of proportion to injury is one of the key features of acute compartment syndrome (ACS). ACS can occur due to various causes including trauma, crush injuries, burns or vascular injuries leading to increased tissue pressure within a confined space resulting in ischemia and necrosis of muscles and nerves within that space if not treated promptly by fasciotomy.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents with complaints of severe pain and swelling in her left forearm after being involved in a motor vehicle accident where she was hit by another car while driving her bike on the highway. She has multiple abrasions on her left arm but no other significant injuries are noted on primary survey except for some mild hypotension which responds well to fluid resuscitation.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Increase spironolactone dose
B. Add rifaximin to current regimen
C. Perform diagnostic paracentesis
D. Initiate treatment with terlipressin
E. Refer for liver transplant evaluation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient has cirrhosis with a history of SBP and persistent ascites despite diuretic therapy, suggesting that diagnostic paracentesis (C) should be performed to evaluate for infection or other complications such as malignancy or portal hypertension-related causes of ascites. Increasing the spironolactone dose (A) may not provide additional benefit if she is already on maximum tolerated doses, while adding rifaximin (B) would not address her underlying issue of refractory ascites. Terlipressin (D) would only be indicated for hepatorenal syndrome and referral for liver transplant evaluation (E) may be premature at this time.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of increasing abdominal distension over the past few months along with decreased appetite and early satiety. He denies any significant medical history but admits to drinking alcohol regularly in the past.

On examination, he has moderate ascites without signs of overt hepatic encephalopathy or jaundice. His laboratory results show a serum sodium level of 130 mEq/L, albumin level of 3.0 g/dL, and normal renal function tests.

What imaging modality would be most appropriate to further evaluate this patient? 

A. CT abdomen/pelvis
B. MRI abdomen/pelvis
C. Ultrasound-guided biopsy
D. PET scan
E. Transjugular liver biopsy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient has moderate ascites without any concerning laboratory abnormalities, making CT abdomen/pelvis (A) the most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate for underlying causes of his ascites such as malignancy or portal hypertension-related causes. MRI (B) may be useful in certain situations but is not typically first-line for evaluating ascites. Ultrasound-guided biopsy (C) and PET scan (D) would not be indicated at this time, while transjugular liver biopsy (E) may be considered if other diagnostic modalities are inconclusive or contraindicated.

E. Discharge the patient from follow-up as he does not wish to take medication

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Patients with bipolar disorder who discontinue their medication are at high risk of relapse and should be closely monitored by mental health services. Referral back to specialist care is therefore recommended in this case.

Question
A 3-year-old girl is brought to the GP by her parents, who are concerned about their child's developmental delay. The parents report that she has been missing most of her milestones and that her development is lagging behind what is expected for her age. They also mention that their daughter has difficulty with social interaction and communication, as well as displaying repetitive behaviours such as hand flapping and toe walking. On examination, the patient demonstrates poor eye contact and limited speech consisting of only a few words. She displays hyperactivity and impulsivity, making it difficult for the doctor to conduct a thorough assessment.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Autism spectrum disorder
B. Down syndrome
C. Cerebral palsy
D. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
E. Fragile X syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presentation of delayed development along with difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors suggest autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While other conditions may present similarly, ASD is the most likely diagnosis given this patient's symptoms.

Question
A 2-year-old boy presents to his paediatrician with concerns regarding his developmental progress. His parents report that he has not yet started talking or communicating effectively despite being able to understand simple instructions from them at home. He appears uninterested in playing with toys or engaging in social interactions with others around him.

On examination, the patient appears healthy but does not respond appropriately when spoken to by the doctor or nurse practitioner conducting the assessment.

What should be included in further investigations? 

A. Blood tests 
B. Genetic testing 
C. MRI scan 
D. Hearing test 
E. All of the above 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Given this patient's lack of response during an initial assessment, further investigations are necessary to identify any underlying causes for his developmental delay which could include blood tests, genetic testing, MRI scans or hearing tests. A comprehensive approach to diagnosis is necessary in order to identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the patient's developmental delay.

Question
A 5-year-old girl presents with concerns regarding her speech and language development. Her parents report that she has difficulty pronouncing certain words and often struggles to communicate effectively with others around her, leading to frustration for both herself and those trying to understand her.

On examination, the patient appears healthy but demonstrates a limited vocabulary and difficulty articulating certain sounds.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Speech sound disorder
B. Stuttering 
C. Expressive language disorder 
D. Receptive language disorder 
E. Apraxia of speech 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presentation of difficulty articulating certain sounds suggests a speech sound disorder, which can affect a child's ability to produce specific sounds or groups of sounds correctly, making it difficult for them to communicate effectively with others around them. While other conditions may present similarly, this patient's symptoms are consistent with a speech sound disorder as opposed to stuttering or other communication disorders.

Question
A 68-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and difficulty passing urine. He has a history of bladder cancer, for which he underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) followed by intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy six months ago. On examination, his abdomen is distended and tender on palpation. Blood tests reveal raised inflammatory markers and creatinine levels. CT scan shows diffuse thickening of the bladder wall with multiple nodules suggestive of recurrent bladder cancer.
Which of the following would be the most appropriate management?

A. Repeat TURBT
B. Radical cystectomy
C. Palliative care only
D. Chemotherapy alone
E. Combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancer, which requires radical cystectomy as definitive treatment.

Question
A 62-year-old female presents to her GP with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms including frequency, urgency, dysuria, and nocturia for several months. She also reports occasional episodes of haematuria but denies any weight loss or systemic symptoms. Urinalysis reveals microscopic haematuria without infection or inflammation.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Overactive bladder syndrome 
B. Interstitial cystitis 
C. Bladder stones 
D. Benign prostatic hyperplasia 
E. Non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Persistent lower urinary tract symptoms in an elderly patient with microscopic haematuria should raise suspicion for non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma until proven otherwise.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of fatigue, malaise, and unintentional weight loss over the past few weeks along with visible blood in his urine. He has a history of smoking and alcohol abuse but is otherwise healthy. On examination, he appears pale and his abdomen is tender on palpation.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute pyelonephritis 
B. Renal cell carcinoma 
C. Prostate cancer 
D. Bladder urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma) with muscle invasion
E. Testicular cancer

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with advanced bladder urothelial carcinoma with muscle invasion, which can cause systemic symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, weight loss along with visible blood in urine and abdominal pain/tenderness on palpation due to metastasis or local spread of tumour.

Question
A 32-year-old woman who is 20 weeks pregnant presents to the antenatal clinic with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and poor glycaemic control despite multiple insulin injections per day. She has had two previous pregnancies, both complicated by pre-eclampsia and premature delivery at 30 weeks gestation due to severe fetal growth restriction.

What is the most appropriate next step in her management? 

A. Add glibenclamide to metformin therapy
B. Switch from metformin to insulin therapy
C. Continue metformin monotherapy 
D. Refer for bariatric surgery 
E. Prescribe a low-carbohydrate diet 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient has pre-existing diabetes and is currently on metformin therapy, which is not adequately controlling her fasting blood glucose levels. The best course of action would be to switch from oral hypoglycemic agents to insulin therapy as it provides better glycaemic control in pregnancy.

Question
A 30-year-old woman who is 36 weeks pregnant presents to the labour ward with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosed at 28 weeks gestation. She has been managed with lifestyle modifications and insulin therapy, with good glycaemic control throughout pregnancy.

On examination, she has no other medical conditions apart from obesity with a BMI of 32 kg/mÂ². Her cervix is fully dilated, and fetal heart rate monitoring shows signs of fetal distress.

What is the most appropriate next step in her management? 

A. Proceed with vaginal delivery
B. Perform an emergency caesarean section 
C. Administer intravenous fluids and oxytocin for augmentation 
D. Monitor closely for further signs of fetal distress 
E. Consult neonatology team for immediate resuscitation after birth

Explanation: In this scenario, there are signs of fetal distress on fetal heart rate monitoring, indicating that urgent delivery is required to prevent adverse outcomes such as stillbirth or neonatal morbidity and mortality. An emergency caesarean section would be the most appropriate next step in management.

Question
A 56-year-old female presents to her ophthalmologist with a complaint of chronic redness, irritation and itching in both eyes for the past year. She reports that she has been using artificial tears but they only provide temporary relief. On examination, there is bilateral crusting and erythema of the eyelids as well as mild conjunctival hyperaemia. The patient explains this is normal for her with no recent changes. Visual acuity is normal. Her medical history includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus which are all well controlled on medications.

Which one of the following is true regarding blepharitis? 

A. It can be caused by viral infections
B. It usually affects only one eye
C. It commonly occurs in patients without any underlying systemic conditions
D. Treatment involves topical corticosteroids alone
E. Blepharitis can lead to corneal ulcers

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Blepharitis can cause inflammation of the eyelid margins leading to crusting, scaling or flaking skin around the lashes and base of the eyelids which may result in secondary infection or corneal ulceration if left untreated.

Question
A 40-year-old male presents to his GP complaining of recurrent episodes of painful swelling in his right upper eyelid over the last few months accompanied by redness and tenderness on palpation which resolved spontaneously after a week each time it occurred. He also complains of burning sensation in both eyes especially when he wakes up in the morning along with a gritty feeling under his lids throughout the day for several weeks now.
On examination, there is an erythematous tender lump present at the lid margin near its centre on his right eye while bilateral crusting and erythema were noted at other areas around both eyes.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chalazion
B. Hordeolum
C. Allergic conjunctivitis 
D. Seborrhoeic dermatitis 
E. Sjogren's syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patientâs symptoms are consistent with blepharitis and chalazion which is a chronic inflammatory condition of the meibomian gland that presents as a painless, firm nodule on the eyelid.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to her GP complaining of redness, itching and burning sensation in both eyes for several weeks now accompanied by flaking skin around her lashes especially upon waking up in the morning. She also reports having dandruff and oily skin on her face.
On examination, there is bilateral crusting and erythema of the eyelids as well as mild conjunctival hyperaemia.

What is the most likely cause? 

A. Demodex infestation
B. Rosacea
C. Meibomian gland dysfunction 
D. Staphylococcal blepharitis 
E. Anterior uveitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patientâs symptoms are consistent with ocular rosacea which can present with inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis) along with other features such as facial flushing, telangiectasia, papules or pustules on cheeks, nose or forehead etc., due to underlying sebaceous gland dysfunction leading to overgrowth of bacteria like staphylococcus aureus or demodex folliculorum mites causing an inflammatory response in affected areas including the eyes.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe dehydration and confusion. He has a history of head trauma following a car accident several years ago, but no other significant medical history. On examination, he is tachycardic with dry mucous membranes and reduced skin turgor. Blood tests show hypernatremia and elevated serum osmolality.

What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? 

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus
B. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
C. Primary polydipsia 
D. Hypovolemic shock due to haemorrhage
E. Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests cranial diabetes insipidus, which can occur as a result of head trauma or pituitary surgery. This condition results from insufficient production or release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, leading to excessive urine output and dehydration.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with complaints of increased thirst and frequent urination for the past few months. She has no significant medical history but reports taking lithium for bipolar disorder for several years.

On examination, she appears euvolaemic when assessing hydration status, and vital signs are within normal range. Investigations reveal low urine osmolality after fluid deprivation and high urine osmolality after desmopressin.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus
B. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
C. Lithium-induced nephropathy 
D. Polycystic ovary syndrome 
E. Type 2 diabetes mellitus 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's clinical features suggest nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which can be caused by lithium toxicity. This condition results from a defect in the renal tubules that prevents them from responding to ADH, leading to excessive urine output and dehydration.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents with complaints of increased thirst and frequent urination for the past few weeks. He has no significant medical history but reports taking an over-the-counter herbal supplement for weight loss.

On examination, he appears euvolaemic when assessing hydration status, and vital signs are within normal range. Investigations reveal low urine osmolality after fluid deprivation and high urine osmolality after desmopressin.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus
B. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
C. Primary polydipsia 
D. Acute kidney injury 
E. Renal tubular acidosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's clinical features suggest primary polydipsia, which can be caused by excessive water intake due to psychological factors or compulsive behaviour. In this condition, there is no underlying defect in ADH secretion or action, but excessive water intake leads to dilutional hyponatremia and low urine osmolality despite fluid deprivation or administration of desmopressin.

Question
A 35-year-old woman with a history of gestational diabetes presents to the clinic for follow-up after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has been started on metformin and advised to make lifestyle changes, including weight loss and regular exercise. However, she reports difficulty in adhering to these recommendations due to her busy work schedule and family responsibilities. Her HbA1c levels have remained elevated despite medication and lifestyle modifications. Which of the following medications would be most appropriate as an add-on therapy? 

A. Glipizide
B. Pioglitazone
C. Exenatide
D. Canagliflozin 
E. Insulin glargine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient is already taking metformin, which is considered first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glipizide (option A) is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells; however, it carries a risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain, which may not be ideal for this patient who struggles with adherence to lifestyle changes. Pioglitazone (option B) is a thiazolidinedione that improves insulin sensitivity but can cause fluid retention and increase the risk of heart failure in some patients, making it less suitable for this patient who has obesity and hypertension as comorbidities. Canagliflozin (option D) is an SGLT-2 inhibitor that promotes glucose excretion through urine; however, it can cause genital infections and increase the risk of ketoacidosis in some patients, which may not be optimal for this patient who has a history of urinary tract infections and poor glycemic control despite metformin therapy alone.
Exenatide (option C), a GLP-1 receptor agonist, enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion while suppressing glucagon secretion, leading to improved glycemic control and weight loss. It is administered subcutaneously twice daily or once weekly, making it a convenient option for patients who have difficulty adhering to multiple daily injections of insulin. Therefore, exenatide would be the most appropriate add-on therapy for this patient.

Question
A 25-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fruity breath odor. He reports missing his insulin injections over the past few days due to financial constraints and lack of access to healthcare services. His blood glucose level is 28 mmol/L, pH is 7.2, bicarbonate level is 10 mmol/L, and ketone level is elevated. The medical team initiates intravenous fluids and insulin therapy but notices that his potassium levels are low at 3.0 mmol/L. Which of the following interventions should be done first? 

A. Administer potassium chloride infusion
B. Repeat serum potassium measurement 
C. Administer sodium bicarbonate infusion
D. Initiate continuous cardiac monitoring 
E. Perform arterial blood gas analysis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients with DKA due to osmotic diuresis and insulin therapy; however, correcting hypokalemia before initiating insulin therapy can increase the risk of arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Therefore, option A (administer potassium chloride infusion) may not be the best initial intervention in this case as it could exacerbate hypokalemia-induced cardiac complications.
Option B (repeat serum potassium measurement) may be necessary after starting fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy to monitor changes in serum electrolytes; however, it does not address the immediate concern of potential cardiac arrhythmias.
Option C (administer sodium bicarbonate infusion) is not recommended in most cases of DKA as it can worsen intracellular acidosis and lead to paradoxical cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, which may cause cerebral edema and neurological complications.
Option E (perform arterial blood gas analysis) may be useful for assessing the severity of metabolic acidosis and respiratory compensation but does not address the immediate concern of hypokalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmias.
Therefore, option D (initiate continuous cardiac monitoring) should be done first to monitor for any signs of arrhythmias or other cardiac complications that could arise from hypokalemia. Once the patient's cardiac status has been stabilized, potassium replacement therapy can be initiated.

Question
A 50-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to her primary care physician for routine follow-up. She reports feeling generally well but notes occasional episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness when standing up quickly. Her blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg while seated and drops to 100/60 mmHg upon standing. Her HbA1c level is 7%, and her renal function tests are within normal limits. Which of the following medications would be most appropriate for managing this patient's symptoms? 

A. Metformin
B. Glipizide
C. Pioglitazone
D. Sitagliptin 
E. Midodrine

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest orthostatic hypotension, a common complication in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to long-standing diabetes mellitus; however, they may also be caused by antihypertensive medications or other comorbidities such as dehydration or anemia.
Metformin (option A), glipizide (option B), pioglitazone (option C), and sitagliptin (option D) are all antidiabetic medications that do not address the underlying cause of orthostatic hypotension and may even exacerbate it by lowering blood pressure further. Therefore, they would not be appropriate for managing this patient's symptoms.
Midodrine (option E) is an alpha-1 agonist that constricts peripheral blood vessels and increases blood pressure, making it a suitable option for treating orthostatic hypotension in patients with diabetes mellitus. It should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment or supine hypertension due to its potential to increase urinary retention and worsen fluid overload. Therefore, midodrine would be the most appropriate medication for managing this patient's symptoms.

Question
A 62-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to his ophthalmologist with complaints of decreased vision in both eyes for the past year. He reports no pain, flashes or floaters but does complain of difficulty reading and driving. On examination, visual acuity is reduced to 20/60 in both eyes, intraocular pressure is normal and slit-lamp examination reveals mild cataracts bilaterally. Fundus examination shows multiple microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhages, hard exudates and cotton wool spots scattered throughout both retinae.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
B. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy 
C. Diabetic macular edema
D. Branch retinal vein occlusion
E. Central serous chorioretinopathy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and fundoscopic findings are consistent with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), which is characterized by microvascular changes such as microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhages, hard exudates and cotton wool spots scattered throughout the retinae.

Question
A 45-year-old woman with a long-standing history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to her optometrist complaining of blurred vision in her left eye for the past week that has not improved despite frequent use of artificial tears. She denies any pain or photophobia but does report seeing occasional flashes of light in her peripheral vision on the affected side.
On examination, visual acuity is reduced to 20/40 in the left eye compared to 20/25 in the right eye, intraocular pressure is normal and slit-lamp examination reveals mild conjunctival injection without any corneal abnormalities or anterior chamber inflammation.
Fundus examination shows a small area of retinal thickening with hard exudates and microaneurysms in the macula of the left eye.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Diabetic macular edema
B. Central serous chorioretinopathy 
C. Branch retinal vein occlusion
D. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy
E. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and fundoscopic findings are consistent with diabetic macular edema (DME), which is characterized by fluid accumulation in the central retina due to increased vascular permeability and breakdown of the blood-retina barrier.

Question
A 58-year-old man with a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to his ophthalmologist for routine follow-up after being diagnosed with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) during his last visit six months ago.
On examination, visual acuity is stable at 20/25 bilaterally, intraocular pressure is normal and slit-lamp examination reveals no abnormalities in the anterior segment.
Fundus examination shows progression of NPDR to moderate severity with multiple areas of intraretinal hemorrhages, venous beading, and cotton wool spots scattered throughout both retinae.
What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Observation only 
B. Referral for panretinal photocoagulation 
C. Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents 
D. Referral for vitrectomy surgery 
E. Initiation or intensification of systemic glucose control

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient has progressed from mild to moderate NPDR within six months, indicating an increased risk for developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) has been shown to reduce the risk of severe vision loss in patients with high-risk PDR and is therefore the most appropriate management option at this stage.

Question
A 45-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for the past two days. She reports that she has not been taking her insulin as prescribed due to financial constraints. On examination, she is found to be tachycardic and hypotensive with dry mucous membranes. Her capillary blood glucose level is 34 mmol/l, and ketones are present in her urine.

Which of the following statements regarding diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) management is correct? 

A. Intravenous fluids should be administered at a rate of 1-1.5 L/hour until the patient's blood pressure normalizes
B. Insulin infusion should be started immediately after fluid resuscitation 
C. Serum potassium levels should be checked every four hours during treatment 
D. Sodium bicarbonate administration is recommended in all cases of DKA 
E. The use of oral hypoglycaemic agents can be considered as an alternative to insulin therapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients presenting with DKA, initial management involves aggressive fluid resuscitation using isotonic saline solution followed by intravenous insulin infusion once adequate hydration has been achieved. Potassium replacement may also be necessary depending on serum levels; however, frequent monitoring is required to avoid hyperkalemia or hypokalemia complications associated with insulin therapy.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath and chest pain for the past few hours. He has a known history of type 1 diabetes mellitus but admits non-compliance with his insulin regimen over the last week due to personal reasons.

On examination, he appears anxious and tachypnoeic with shallow breathing patterns while oxygen saturation on room air is 88%. His arterial blood gas analysis shows pH=7.20, pCO2=30 mmHg, HCO3-=12 mEq/L.

Which of the following statements regarding this patient's management is correct? 

A. The administration of sodium bicarbonate should be considered to correct respiratory acidosis 
B. Intravenous fluids containing dextrose should be initiated immediately
C. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy can be used as a first-line treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
D. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended in all cases of DKA 
E. A chest X-ray is not necessary unless there is suspicion of pneumonia or pulmonary embolism

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with DKA presenting with signs and symptoms of hypoxia or respiratory distress, oxygen supplementation should be started immediately along with fluid resuscitation using isotonic saline solution containing dextrose to avoid hypoglycemia complications associated with insulin therapy. NIV may also be required if the patient fails to improve after initial interventions.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting for the past two days. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus but admits non-compliance with her insulin regimen over the last week due to personal reasons.

On examination, she appears dehydrated and tachycardic while her capillary blood glucose level measures 32 mmol/l with ketones present in her urine.

Which of the following laboratory findings would support a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis? 

A. Hypokalemia
B. Hypernatremia
C. Metabolic alkalosis
D. Elevated serum lactate levels
E. Anion gap metabolic acidosis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis resulting from increased production and accumulation of ketone bodies secondary to insulin deficiency. Hypokalemia may also be present due to intracellular shifts and urinary losses of potassium during treatment with insulin therapy. Hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated serum lactate levels are not typically associated with DKA.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes presents to the clinic with complaints of fatigue and swelling in his legs. His most recent eGFR is 48 mL/min/1.72m2, and urinalysis reveals proteinuria (+++).

If a mutation is identified, screening and management recommendations may differ from those for the general population.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his GP with concerns about his risk of developing lung cancer due to his smoking history; he has smoked one pack per day for the past 15 years. The GP recommends screening with low-dose CT scan of the chest.
Which one of the following statements regarding this patient is true? 

A. This patient should undergo annual screening with low-dose CT scans until age 55
B. This patient should have spirometry testing before undergoing CT screening
C. This patient should be started on nicotine replacement therapy before undergoing CT screening
D. This patient should undergo PET-CT scanning instead of low-dose CT scanning
E. This patient does not require any further intervention at present

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Low-dose CT scanning has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in high-risk populations such as current or former smokers aged 55-80 who have a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years (i.e., smoking one pack per day for 30 years). Annual screening is recommended for these individuals until they reach age 80 or develop significant comorbidities that limit their life expectancy.

Question
A 45-year-old male patient with a history of liver cirrhosis and alcohol abuse presents to the emergency department with fever, confusion, and jaundice. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time, and increased D-dimer levels. Imaging studies show evidence of portal vein thrombosis and splenomegaly. The patient is suspected to have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to his underlying liver disease.

Which of the following laboratory findings would support the diagnosis of DIC in this patient? 

A. Low fibrinogen levels
B. Elevated factor VIII levels
C. Normal antithrombin III activity
D. Decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels
E. Increased protein C activity

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In patients with DIC, there is widespread activation of the coagulation system leading to consumption of clotting factors and platelets resulting in bleeding diathesis. Laboratory findings consistent with DIC include low fibrinogen levels (<150 mg/dL), prolonged PT/INR or aPTT (>1.5 times control), elevated D-dimer levels (>500 ng/mL), decreased platelet count (<100 x 10^9/L), and evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes on peripheral blood smear). Option A is correct as it describes one of the key features seen in DIC.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents to her obstetrician at 34 weeks gestation complaining of vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain for several hours. She has no significant past medical history but reports having had two previous miscarriages in the first trimester. On examination, she appears pale and tachycardic with a tender abdomen consistent with uterine contractions.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms? 

A. Placenta previa
B. Abruptio placentae
C. Uterine rupture
D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation
E. Ectopic pregnancy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Abruptio placentae is a medical emergency that occurs when the placenta separates from the uterine wall before delivery, leading to vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. It can be caused by trauma, hypertension, cocaine use, or other factors that disrupt blood flow to the placenta. DIC may occur as a complication of abruptio placentae due to release of tissue factor into the maternal circulation leading to activation of the coagulation cascade.

Question
A 58-year-old male patient with a history of metastatic lung cancer presents to his oncologist complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath for several days. He has been receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide for the past six months and has had multiple hospital admissions for neutropenic sepsis during this time.

Blood tests reveal low hemoglobin levels, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). Coagulation studies show prolonged PT/INR and aPTT along with decreased fibrinogen levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
B. Hemolytic uremic syndrome 
C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation 
D. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
E. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but life-threatening disorder characterized by the formation of microthrombi in small blood vessels leading to MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and organ dysfunction. It is caused by a deficiency of ADAMTS13 enzyme which cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers into smaller fragments preventing their aggregation and platelet activation. In contrast, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is typically associated with Shiga toxin-producing E.coli infections or other causes of endothelial injury leading to platelet activation and thrombus formation. DIC may also present with similar laboratory findings but is usually secondary to an underlying disease process such as sepsis or malignancy.

Endotracheal intubation should be performed immediately under direct visualization or fiberoptic guidance.

Question
A 4-year-old girl presents to her GP with a history of sore throat, fever, cough, and hoarseness for three days now. She was previously healthy without any significant medical history or recent travel history; however, she had not received any immunizations due to parental choice.
On examination, she appears uncomfortable but alert with mild stridor at rest but no signs of respiratory distress or cyanosis noted.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute bronchitis 
B. Laryngomalacia 
C. Croup 
D. Bacterial tracheitis 
E. Epiglottitis 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features suggest epiglottitis as the most likely diagnosis since it typically presents with sudden onset of high fever, sore throat, drooling, and inspiratory stridor. The absence of respiratory distress or cyanosis does not exclude the diagnosis.

Question
A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents with a history of worsening cough, fever, and difficulty breathing for two days now. He has been treated with oral antibiotics prescribed by his GP but has shown no improvement.

A. Administer lorazepam
B. Initiate phenobarbital therapy
C. Perform an EEG
D. Start levetiracetam therapy
E. Transfer to ICU for intubation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's prolonged seizure and decreased level of consciousness indicate that he requires airway protection and mechanical ventilation, which can be provided in the intensive care unit (ICU). Lorazepam or another benzodiazepine may be used initially to terminate seizures, but given the duration of this patient's seizure, more aggressive measures are needed.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of recurrent episodes where she feels like she is "losing control" and experiences intense fear and anxiety followed by confusion and memory loss. These episodes occur without warning and last for several minutes before resolving spontaneously.

Which of the following diagnostic tests would be most helpful in confirming a diagnosis? 

A. MRI brain imaging 
B. Lumbar puncture 
C. Complete blood count (CBC) 
D. Electroencephalogram (EEG)
E. Urinalysis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests temporal lobe epilepsy as a possible diagnosis, which can often be confirmed by an abnormal EEG showing epileptiform discharges originating from the temporal lobes.

Question
A 30-year-old man with refractory epilepsy undergoes evaluation for surgical intervention. He has failed multiple antiepileptic medications and continues to experience frequent seizures despite maximal medical management. MRI brain imaging reveals a focal lesion in the left temporal lobe.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Initiate treatment with carbamazepine 
B. Perform an EEG 
C. Refer for neuropsychological evaluation 
D. Start levetiracetam therapy 
E. Consider surgical resection of the lesion

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presence of a focal lesion on MRI, along with refractory epilepsy, suggests that surgical resection may be a viable option for this patient. Referral for neuropsychological evaluation can help assess potential risks and benefits of surgery, but ultimately the decision to proceed with resection will depend on factors such as location and extent of the lesion, risk of postoperative deficits, and likelihood of seizure freedom following surgery.

Question

C. Wegener's granulomatosis 
D. Angiofibroma 
E. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Epistaxis accompanied by facial pain, swelling, and unilateral nasal symptoms in an adult male should raise suspicion for vascular tumours such as angiofibromas that arise from the sphenopalatine artery or its branches and are more commonly seen in adolescent males.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with a history of recurrent headaches, palpitations and sweating for the past year. His blood pressure is found to be consistently high at 180/100mmHg on multiple readings. He has no significant medical or family history and does not smoke or drink alcohol. Initial investigations including renal function tests, urine analysis and echocardiogram are normal. Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step in management? Should he be started on antihypertensive medication? If so, which drug class should be used? What lifestyle modifications should also be recommended? 

A. Calcium channel blockers
B. Beta-blockers
C. ACE inhibitors
D. Thiazide diuretics
E. Alpha-adrenergic blockers

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest possible secondary hypertension; however, initial investigations have been unremarkable. Essential hypertension remains a possibility but further investigation may still be required if his blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment with an ACE inhibitor (option C). Lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, dietary salt restriction, regular exercise and moderation of alcohol intake should also be recommended.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a history of refractory hypertension despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications including calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics over several years. She has no significant medical or family history and does not smoke or drink alcohol excessively. Her ambulatory blood pressure monitoring shows persistently elevated readings above 160/95 mmHg during daytime hours despite optimal medical therapy.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of her resistant hypertension? What additional investigations would you consider? What other treatment options could potentially improve her blood pressure control?

A. Renal artery stenosis
B. Primary aldosteronism 
C. Coarctation of the aorta
D. Cushing's syndrome 
E. Pheochromocytoma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Primary aldosteronism (option B) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and should be considered in patients with refractory hypertension despite optimal medical therapy. Additional investigations such as measurement of plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone levels, and adrenal imaging may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment options include surgical resection or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a history of recurrent episodes of headache, sweating and palpitations for several months.

Question
A 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious in his home. He has a history of alcohol abuse and was last seen drinking heavily the night before. On examination, he is comatose with no response to painful stimuli. His pupils are fixed and dilated, and he has flaccid paralysis of all four limbs. CT scan shows a large lens-shaped hyperdensity between the cranium and outer dura mater on the right side of his brain.
Which one of the following is correct? 

A. Extradural haemorrhage due to arterial bleeding
B. Subdural haemorrhage due to venous bleeding
C. Intracerebral haemorrhage 
D. Subarachnoid haemorrhage 
E. Traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests an acute extradural hematoma (EDH) caused by arterial bleeding from a ruptured middle meningeal artery due to head trauma or skull fracture. The classic appearance on CT scan is that of a biconvex or lens-shaped hyperdensity between the cranium and outer dura mater.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to the emergency department after being involved in a motor vehicle accident where he was not wearing a seatbelt and hit his head against the windshield causing him to lose consciousness for several minutes at the scene.

A. Administer mannitol
B. Perform immediate craniotomy 
C. Obtain urgent CT scan without contrast 
D. Order MRI with gadolinium enhancement 
E. Start anticoagulation therapy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Urgent non-contrast CT scan is the first-line investigation in patients with suspected traumatic brain injury. It can identify an extradural hematoma (EDH), which appears as a lens-shaped hyperdensity between the cranium and outer dura mater, and other intracranial injuries that may require immediate surgical intervention.

Question
A 40-year-old male presents to the emergency department after being assaulted by a group of people who hit him repeatedly on his head with blunt objects causing him to lose consciousness for several minutes at the scene. On arrival, he complains of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and confusion with GCS score of 12/15.
Which one of the following is correct? 

A. Extradural haemorrhage is more common than subdural haemorrhage in this scenario
B. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is more common than epidural haemorrhage in this scenario 
C. The presence of focal neurological deficits suggests a diffuse axonal injury 
D. CT scan without contrast should be performed immediately 
E. Anticoagulation therapy should be initiated

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In cases of suspected traumatic brain injury due to assault or blunt trauma, urgent non-contrast CT scan should be performed to evaluate for any intracranial bleeding including epidural hematoma (EDH) or subdural hematoma (SDH). EDHs are less common than SDHs but have higher mortality rates if not promptly diagnosed and treated.

Question
A 3-year-old child is brought to the emergency department with a history of fever and convulsions for the past hour. The mother reports that the child had a high-grade fever, which was not responding to antipyretics, followed by a tonic-clonic seizure lasting for about 5 minutes. On examination, the child is drowsy but responsive to verbal stimuli. Vital signs are stable except for tachycardia and mild respiratory distress. There is no focal neurological deficit or meningeal irritation. Investigations reveal leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein levels. Which one of the following should be considered as part of initial management? 

A. Lumbar puncture
B. Intravenous antibiotics
C. Antiepileptic medication 
D. CT scan brain
E. Blood transfusion

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In this case, given the history of febrile convulsion along with evidence of infection (leukocytosis and elevated CRP), intravenous antibiotics should be initiated after obtaining blood cultures.

Question
A 2-year-old boy presents with his second episode of febrile convulsion in six months duration. He has been otherwise healthy with normal development milestones and no significant medical history apart from these two episodes of seizures associated with fever above 38Â°Celsius each time lasting less than five minutes without any focality or post-ictal confusion noted on both occasions. His parents are concerned about future risks and complications related to these episodes.
Which one of the following statements regarding febrile convulsions is correct? 

A) Febrile convulsions have an increased risk of developing epilepsy later in life.
B) Children who experience prolonged (>15 min) or recurrent febrile seizures are at higher risk for cognitive impairment.
C) Febrile seizures do not require any further investigations unless there are red flags present.
D) Antiepileptic medication is recommended for all children who have had febrile seizures.
E) Febrile convulsions are more common in girls than boys.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Most cases of febrile convulsion do not require any further investigations unless there are red flags present. Red flags include focal neurology, abnormal development or regression, family history of epilepsy or neurological disorders, and atypical features such as prolonged duration (>15 min), recurrent episodes within 24 hours, or age less than six months or more than five years.

Question
A 5-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a history of fever and seizure activity lasting for about 10 minutes. The child has no significant past medical history and is up to date on her immunizations. On examination, she is unresponsive with generalized tonic-clonic movements noted along with frothing from the mouth. Vital signs reveal tachycardia and mild respiratory distress. Investigations reveal leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. CT scan brain shows no acute intracranial pathology.
Which one of the following should be considered? 

A) Status epilepticus
B) Meningitis 
C) Encephalitis
D) Intracranial hemorrhage
E) Hypoglycemia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In this case, given the prolonged duration of seizure activity (more than five minutes), it meets criteria for status epilepticus which requires urgent management including prompt initiation of antiepileptic medications such as benzodiazepines followed by second-line agents if needed. Other differential diagnoses such as meningitis, encephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage should also be considered but would typically present with additional clinical findings beyond just seizure activity alone.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the breast clinic with a lump in her left breast that has been present for several months. She reports no nipple discharge, skin changes or pain associated with the lump. On examination, there is a well-defined, mobile and firm mass measuring approximately 4 cm x 3 cm in size located in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast. There are no palpable axillary lymph nodes. The patient undergoes an ultrasound-guided core biopsy which reveals a fibroadenoma.
Which one of the following statements regarding fibroadenomas is true? 

A. Fibroadenomas have malignant potential
B. Fibroadenomas are more common in postmenopausal women
C. Fibroadenomas can be treated with radiation therapy 
D. Fibroadenomas may regress spontaneously without treatment 
E. Fibroadenomas are usually bilateral

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Although fibroadenomas are benign tumors, they do not have malignant potential and rarely transform into cancerous growths. They are most commonly found in premenopausal women but can occur at any age. Treatment options include observation, surgical excision or vacuum-assisted biopsy if necessary; radiation therapy is not typically used to treat fibroadenomas as it does not provide significant benefit over other treatments.

Question
A 27-year-old female presents with a history of multiple lumps in both breasts for several years which increase in size during menstruation and decrease afterwards. She reports no nipple discharge, skin changes or pain associated with the lumps and has no relevant past medical history.
On examination, there is diffuse nodularity bilaterally involving all quadrants of both breasts making it difficult to differentiate between normal breast tissue and the lumps themselves.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Invasive ductal carcinoma
B. Lobular carcinoma in situ
C. Fibroadenoma
D. Mastitis
E. Phyllodes tumor

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with fibrocystic change of the breast, which is a benign condition characterized by diffuse nodularity and lumpy texture of the breasts that fluctuates in size during menstrual cycles. Fibroadenomas are also a common finding in this condition and can present as well-defined mobile masses.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the breast clinic with a lump in her left breast that has been present for several months. She reports no nipple discharge, skin changes or pain associated with the lump but does have a family history of breast cancer; her mother was diagnosed at age 50.
On examination, there is a well-defined, mobile and firm mass measuring approximately 2 cm x 2 cm located in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast. There are no palpable axillary lymph nodes.
Which one of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Mammography 
B. Breast MRI 
C. PET scan 
D. CT scan 
E. Ultrasound-guided core biopsy 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: An ultrasound-guided core biopsy is the most appropriate investigation for evaluating a suspicious breast lump due to its ability to provide tissue samples for histological analysis without exposing patients to ionizing radiation or contrast agents used in other imaging modalities such as mammography, CT or PET scans. Mammography may be performed after an initial diagnosis has been made to evaluate surrounding tissues and assess for any additional lesions not detected on physical exam or ultrasound imaging. Breast MRI may also be considered if further evaluation is needed but should not replace ultrasound-guided biopsy as the first-line diagnostic tool for suspected breast masses.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain for the past year. She has noticed an increase in the size of her abdomen over the last few months. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the lower abdomen that is non-tender and mobile. An ultrasound scan shows multiple fibroids measuring up to 10 cm in diameter. The patient wishes to preserve her fertility.
What would be the most appropriate management plan for this patient? 

A. Hysterectomy
B. Myomectomy
C. Uterine artery embolisation
D. Progesterone-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)
E. Combined oral contraceptive pill

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In cases where patients wish to preserve their fertility, myomectomy is considered as the preferred treatment option for symptomatic fibroids.

Question
A 40-year-old nulliparous woman presents with menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea for several years, which have worsened recently causing significant interference with daily activities and quality of life. Pelvic examination reveals an enlarged uterus consistent with fibroids on bimanual examination.

A. Transvaginal ultrasound 
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
C. Computed tomography (CT) scan 
D. X-ray 
E. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Transvaginal ultrasound is usually the initial investigation of choice for suspected uterine fibroids due to its high sensitivity and specificity.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with post-menopausal bleeding after two years of amenorrhea.She also complains of abdominal distension and urinary frequency.On examination,a large irregularly shaped mass extending from pelvis to umbilicus was noted.The mass was firm and non-tender.An ultrasound scan shows a 15 cm fibroid with areas of necrosis.
What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Hysterectomy
B. Myomectomy
C. Uterine artery embolisation
D. Hormonal therapy 
E. Observation

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In postmenopausal women, any vaginal bleeding should be investigated thoroughly to rule out endometrial cancer or other malignancies. The presence of a large necrotic fibroid in this case warrants hysterectomy as the most appropriate management option.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents with a history of chronic pain and fatigue for the past six months. She reports that her symptoms have been gradually worsening, and she is now unable to perform daily activities without experiencing severe pain.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the dermatology clinic with a history of recurrent folliculitis for the past year. He reports that he has tried various topical and oral antibiotics, but none have provided any significant relief. On examination, there are multiple erythematous papules and pustules present on his scalp, beard area, chest, back, and buttocks. The lesions appear to be in different stages of development with some showing signs of crusting and others appearing as fresh papules. There is no evidence of scarring or sinus tracts.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acne keloidalis nuchae
B. Pseudofolliculitis barbae
C. Gram-negative folliculitis
D. Dissecting cellulitis
E. Sycosis vulgaris

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation of recurrent folliculitis affecting multiple areas suggests an infectious etiology such as gram-negative folliculitis (GNF). GNF commonly occurs after prolonged antibiotic use for acne vulgaris or rosacea due to overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species in hair follicles leading to inflammation and pustule formation.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents with a 6-month history of painful nodules on her groin area associated with pruritus and malodorous discharge from the affected sites. She reports having similar episodes in the past which were diagnosed as boils by her GP and treated with antibiotics without complete resolution of symptoms.

PTC is preferred over ERCP as it allows for immediate drainage without requiring endoscopy expertise or availability.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain associated with fatty meals for several months. She has no significant past medical history but her mother had gallstones at a young age. Physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the right hypochondrium but no jaundice or hepatomegaly.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute pancreatitis
B. Chronic hepatitis
C. Cholecystitis 
D. Choledocholithiasis 
E. Peptic ulcer disease

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical features are consistent with chronic calculous cholecystitis which typically presents with recurrent episodes of pain in the right upper quadrant after meals. The family history of gallstones increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and fever for two days. He has a past medical history significant for alcohol abuse and chronic pancreatitis. On examination, he is febrile with a tender abdomen and jaundice. Blood tests reveal elevated LFTs, amylase and lipase levels. An ultrasound scan shows dilated intrahepatic bile ducts but no stones are visualized.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute cholecystitis 
B. Choledocholithiasis 
C. Cholangiocarcinoma 
D. Hepatocellular carcinoma
E. Primary sclerosing cholangitis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features suggest primary sclerosing cholangitis which is commonly associated with chronic pancreatitis and alcohol abuse. This condition causes inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts leading to biliary obstruction, recurrent infections and eventually cirrhosis if left untreated.

Question
A 70-year-old male patient with a history of peripheral vascular disease presents to the emergency department with severe pain and discoloration in his left foot. On examination, there is no palpable pulse in the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries. The skin overlying the affected area is cold, pale, and numb. An urgent Doppler ultrasound confirms complete occlusion of the left popliteal artery. The patient is diagnosed with acute limb ischemia and taken for an emergent surgical revascularization procedure.

Which one of the following statements regarding gangrene associated with acute limb ischemia is true? 

A. Dry gangrene is more common than wet gangrene in this setting.
B. Gas gangrene is a rare complication that can occur after surgical intervention.
C. Diabetic patients are less likely to develop gangrene as a result of acute limb ischemia.
D. Wet gangrene typically develops within hours to days after arterial occlusion.
E. Synergistic spreading gangrene (necrotising fasciitis) is not seen in this clinical scenario.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In cases of acute limb ischemia, wet gangrene typically develops within hours to days after arterial occlusion due to rapid tissue necrosis from lack of oxygen and nutrients supplied by blood flow. Dry gangrene occurs when tissues are desiccated by gradual slowing of bloodstream; it is typically the result of atherosclerosis and not related to infection. Gas gangrene can be a rare but serious complication that may occur if bacteria invade dead tissue and produce gas-forming toxins; however, it is not commonly seen after surgical intervention for acute limb ischemia. Diabetic patients have an increased risk for developing complications such as infection and delayed wound healing due to poor circulation; therefore, they are more likely to develop wet rather than dry gangrene in this setting. Synergistic spreading gangrene (necrotising fasciitis) is a rare but severe form of gangrene that can occur in any part of the body, including the limbs. However, it is not typically associated with acute limb ischemia.

Question
A 55-year-old female patient presents to her primary care physician with complaints of pain and swelling in her left leg. She reports a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) for which she was treated with anticoagulation therapy. On examination, there is erythema, warmth, and tenderness over the medial aspect of her left calf. An ultrasound confirms the presence of a new DVT in her left popliteal vein.

Which one of the following statements regarding gangrene associated with DVT is true? 

A. Dry gangrene is more common than wet gangrene in this setting.
B. Gas gangrene is a rare complication that can occur after surgical intervention.
C. Diabetic patients are less likely to develop gangrene as a result of DVT.
D. Wet gangrene typically develops within hours to days after venous occlusion.
E. Synergistic spreading gangrene (necrotising fasciitis) is not seen in this clinical scenario.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Gangrene can be a potential complication of DVT if blood flow through veins becomes obstructed due to clot formation; however, it is relatively uncommon compared to arterial occlusion-induced gangrene. In cases where venous obstruction leads to tissue necrosis, wet rather than dry gangrene usually occurs because venous congestion causes edema and fluid accumulation within tissues leading to bacterial growth and infection. Gas gangrene may rarely occur if bacteria invade dead tissue and produce gas-forming toxins; however, it is not commonly seen after treatment for DVT with anticoagulation therapy alone. Diabetic patients have an increased risk for developing complications such as infection and delayed wound healing due to poor circulation; therefore, they are more likely to develop wet rather than dry gangrene in this setting. Synergistic spreading gangrene (necrotising fasciitis) is a rare but severe form of gangrene that can occur in any part of the body, including the limbs. However, it is not typically associated with DVT.

Question
A 45-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with complaints of pain and swelling in his right hand after sustaining a deep laceration while working on machinery. On examination, there is erythema, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. An X-ray reveals gas within soft tissues suggestive of gas-forming organisms.

Which one of the following statements regarding gas gangrene is true? 

A. It is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes.
B. It usually occurs after surgical intervention for arterial occlusion-induced gangrene.
C. Diabetic patients are less likely to develop gas gangrene compared to non-diabetic patients.
D. Wet rather than dry gangrene typically develops in cases of gas gangrene.
E. Treatment involves only antibiotics without surgical debridement.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Gas gangrene is a serious bacterial infection that can rapidly progress causing extensive tissue destruction leading to sepsis and death if left untreated. It is most commonly caused by Clostridium perfringens which produces toxins that destroy muscle cells resulting in gas accumulation within tissues seen on imaging studies like X-rays or CT scans. Gas gangrene may occur spontaneously or secondary to trauma or surgery; however, it is more commonly seen after surgical intervention for arterial occlusion-induced gangrene rather than other causes like diabetic foot ulcers or pressure sores. Diabetic patients have an increased risk for developing complications such as infection and delayed wound healing due to poor circulation; therefore, they are more likely to develop wet rather than dry gangrene in this setting. Wet rather than dry gangrene typically develops in cases of gas gangrene because bacterial growth and infection occur rapidly within tissues leading to edema and fluid accumulation. Treatment involves aggressive surgical debridement of necrotic tissue combined with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care including wound care, pain management, and hemodynamic support if necessary.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with a history of epigastric pain, vomiting and weight loss over the last 6 months. He has no significant past medical history but does have a family history of gastric cancer. On examination, he is found to have an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow's node).

Question
A 65-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with severe retrosternal chest pain, which radiates to his left arm and jaw. He has a history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) for which he takes proton pump inhibitors regularly. On examination, he is diaphoretic and tachycardic. An electrocardiogram shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. The patient is diagnosed with an acute inferior myocardial infarction.

What are the common symptoms that can differentiate GORD from cardiac chest pain? 

A. Dysphagia
B. Regurgitation
C. Nausea and vomiting
D. Epigastric pain
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: While both GORD and cardiac chest pain may present as retrosternal chest discomfort or burning sensation, there are some distinguishing features between them. Cardiac chest pain often radiates to the neck, jaw, arms or back while GORD usually does not have radiation beyond the epigastrium area. Patients with GORD may experience regurgitation of food or sour liquid into their mouth while patients with cardiac chest pain do not have this symptom unless they also have concomitant oesophageal spasm or achalasia.

Question
A 40-year-old female patient presents to her primary care physician complaining of heartburn after eating spicy foods or drinking alcohol at night time for several months now despite taking over-the-counter antacids occasionally without relief.

Which one of these medications would be most effective in treating this patient? 

A. Metoclopramide 
B. Misoprostol 
C. Sucralfate 
D. Baclofen 
E. Esomeprazole

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective medications for treating GORD. They inhibit gastric acid secretion by irreversibly blocking the hydrogen-potassium ATPase pump in parietal cells of the stomach. Esomeprazole is a PPI that has been shown to be more effective than other PPIs in controlling symptoms and healing oesophagitis.

Question
A 50-year-old male patient presents with recurrent episodes of heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia despite being on high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy for several months. An upper endoscopy reveals multiple strictures and erosions throughout his oesophagus. Biopsies taken during the procedure show no evidence of malignancy or infection.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Increase dose of proton pump inhibitors
B. Switch to an H2 receptor antagonist 
C. Refer for surgical intervention
D. Start treatment with sucralfate 
E. Perform pH monitoring

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's presentation suggests severe, refractory GORD complicated by oesophageal strictures and erosions which can lead to significant morbidity if left untreated. Surgical intervention such as Nissen fundoplication or Linx device placement may be necessary in this case to improve symptoms and prevent further complications like Barrett's oesophagus or oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain and fever. She has a history of multiple sexual partners and was recently diagnosed with gonorrhoea, which she received treatment for. On examination, her abdomen is tender on palpation and there is rebound tenderness present. Blood tests reveal an elevated white cell count and inflammatory markers. An ultrasound shows fluid in the pelvis consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Start intravenous antibiotics
B. Perform a laparoscopy 
C. Administer analgesia only 
D. Discharge home with oral antibiotics 
E. Repeat ultrasound in 24 hours

Explanation: This patient has developed PID as a complication of gonorrhoea infection, which requires urgent treatment with intravenous antibiotics.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to his GP after receiving notification that he has tested positive for gonorrhoea following a recent sexual encounter with a new partner while travelling abroad. He reports no symptoms but is concerned about the implications of this diagnosis on his future fertility prospects due to potential complications from untreated gonorrhoea infections.

Which of the following statements regarding gonorrhoea-induced infertility is true? 

A. Infertility occurs more commonly in females than males.
B. Gonorrhoea can cause infertility through damage to sperm DNA.
C. The risk of infertility increases with each episode of gonorrhoea infection.
D. Antibiotic treatment does not reduce the risk of long-term complications such as infertility.
E. Infertility due to gonorrhoea infection is irreversible.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Repeated episodes of untreated or inadequately treated gonorrhoea infections increase the risk of developing complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to tubal scarring and subsequent infertility in females. In males, untreated gonorrhoea can lead to epididymitis and prostatitis, which can also result in infertility.

Question
A 30-year-old female presents to the genitourinary medicine clinic with a history of recurrent episodes of gonorrhoea over the past year despite receiving treatment each time. She reports no symptoms at present but is concerned about the long-term implications of repeated infections.

Which of the following factors may be contributing to her recurrent gonorrhoea? 

A. Non-compliance with antibiotic therapy
B. Concomitant chlamydia infection 
C. Sexual contact with multiple partners 
D. Antibiotic resistance 
E. Allergic reaction to antibiotics

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The development of antibiotic-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is becoming increasingly common, particularly in individuals who have had repeated episodes of infection or those who have received inadequate treatment for their initial episode. This highlights the importance of appropriate antibiotic selection and public health measures such as screening and partner notification programs to prevent further spread of resistant strains.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with joint pain and fatigue. He has a family history of haemochromatosis and his serum ferritin levels are elevated. The patient undergoes genetic testing, which reveals homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene.

What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient? Describe the role of phlebotomy in treating haemochromatosis and discuss potential complications associated with long-term treatment.

A. Phlebotomy should be initiated immediately to reduce iron overload.
B. Genetic counselling should be offered to the patient's family members.
C. Liver biopsy should be performed to assess for cirrhosis.
D. Iron chelation therapy should be considered as an alternative to phlebotomy.
E. No treatment is necessary at this time.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to excessive absorption of dietary iron, resulting in iron overload and tissue damage over time. The most common cause of hereditary haemochromatosis is homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, as seen in this patient. Treatment involves regular phlebotomy to remove excess iron from the body and prevent organ damage. Complications associated with long-term treatment include anaemia, hypotension, infection, venous thrombosis, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with abdominal pain and jaundice. She has a past medical history significant for alcohol abuse and hepatitis C infection. Imaging studies reveal hepatomegaly with evidence of cirrhosis and increased liver stiffness on transient elastography.

What are some potential causes of secondary haemochromatosis? How does it differ from primary haemochromatosis? Discuss the pathophysiology underlying hepatic iron overload in patients with cirrhosis.

A. Secondary haemochromatosis can be caused by chronic alcohol abuse, hepatitis C infection, and other liver diseases.
B. Primary haemochromatosis is caused by genetic mutations that lead to excessive absorption of dietary iron.
C. Hepatic iron overload in patients with cirrhosis is due to increased intestinal absorption of iron and decreased hepcidin production.
D. Both primary and secondary haemochromatosis result in tissue damage from iron deposition over time.
E. Treatment for secondary haemochromatosis involves phlebotomy or chelation therapy as appropriate.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Secondary haemochromatosis refers to excess iron accumulation in the body due to underlying conditions such as chronic alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, or other liver diseases. It differs from primary haemochromatosis, which is a hereditary disorder caused by genetic mutations that affect iron metabolism. In patients with cirrhosis, hepatic iron overload results from increased intestinal absorption of iron and decreased production of hepcidin, a hormone that regulates systemic iron levels. This can lead to tissue damage over time if left untreated. Treatment options include phlebotomy or chelation therapy depending on the severity of the condition.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents with fatigue and joint pain. He has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of haemochromatosis in his father and grandfather. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation.

What are some potential complications associated with untreated haemochromatosis? How does screening for this condition differ between men and women? Describe the role of genetic testing in diagnosing hereditary haemochromatosis.

A. Complications associated with untreated haemochromatosis include liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomyopathy.
B. Screening for haemochromatosis involves serum ferritin and transferrin saturation testing in men over the age of 30 and postmenopausal women.
C. Genetic testing can confirm a diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis in patients with elevated iron levels.
D. Treatment options for haemochromatosis include phlebotomy or iron chelation therapy as appropriate.
E. All of the above are correct.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Untreated haemochromatosis can lead to a variety of complications including liver disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, and joint damage. Screening for this condition typically involves serum ferritin and transferrin saturation testing in men over the age of 30 and postmenopausal women due to their decreased risk of iron deficiency anaemia. Genetic testing can be used to confirm a diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis in patients with elevated iron levels. Treatment options include phlebotomy or iron chelation therapy depending on the severity of the condition and presence of organ damage.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She has a history of sickle cell disease and is currently pregnant at 28 weeks gestation. On examination, she appears pale and jaundiced with tenderness in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. Blood tests reveal a haemoglobin level of 60 g/L, elevated bilirubin levels and evidence of liver dysfunction. An ultrasound scan shows cholelithiasis with no signs of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute chest syndrome 
B. Sickle cell hepatopathy 
C. Vaso-occlusive crisis 
D. Haemolytic crisis 
E. Sequestration crisis 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Sickle cell hepatopathy is a rare but serious complication of sickle cell disease that occurs due to chronic haemolysis leading to hepatic injury and dysfunction. The clinical presentation can vary from mild asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes to acute hepatic failure requiring transplantation. In pregnancy, the risk for developing this condition increases due to increased blood volume and hypercoagulability associated with pregnancy.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of recurrent episodes of painful swelling in his hands and feet over the past few months along with fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion. He reports a family history of anaemia and gallstones but denies any other significant medical issues or recent infections.

Which one of the following investigations would be most useful in confirming the diagnosis? 

A) Serum ferritin
B) Hb electrophoresis
C) Coombs test
D) Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels
E) Peripheral blood smear

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of iron deficiency anaemia, a common cause of microcytic hypochromic anaemia characterised by low serum ferritin levels and elevated transferrin saturation. Diagnosis can be confirmed by peripheral blood smear which shows hypochromic microcytes with reduced central pallor and increased red cell distribution width (RDW).

Question
A 35-year-old male with severe haemophilia A presents to the emergency department with a painful swelling in his right knee joint. He reports that he had a minor fall while playing football earlier today, which caused the injury. On examination, there is significant effusion and tenderness over the joint, and an X-ray shows no bony abnormalities. The patient's factor VIII level is found to be less than 1% of normal. What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Aspiration of the joint followed by immobilization
B. Administration of recombinant factor VIII concentrate
C. Administration of tranexamic acid
D. Surgical intervention to remove blood from the joint 
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with haemophilia A, bleeding into joints can cause significant pain and disability if not treated promptly. Management involves administration of replacement therapy with recombinant factor VIII concentrate or cryoprecipitate to replace deficient clotting factors.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to her GP clinic complaining of easy bruising and prolonged bleeding after minor injuries for several months now. She has no history of previous bleeding disorders and takes no medications regularly except aspirin occasionally for headaches. Her physical exam reveals multiple bruises on both arms and legs, but otherwise unremarkable findings; laboratory tests show a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) but normal prothrombin time (PT). Further testing reveals low levels of factor XI activity consistent with mild hemophilia C diagnosis.

Which one of the following statements about hemophilia C is true? 

A. It affects males more commonly than females.
B. It results from deficiency in von Willebrand factor.
C. It causes spontaneous bleeding episodes.
D. It usually manifests as severe disease requiring frequent treatment.
E. It may present later in life due to acquired inhibitors.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Hemophilia C is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by deficiency in factor XI, which primarily affects Ashkenazi Jews. It may present later in life due to acquired inhibitors and can cause mild to moderate bleeding episodes that are usually not spontaneous but occur after trauma or surgery. Unlike hemophilia A and B, it affects both males and females equally.

Question
A 16-year-old male with severe haemophilia B presents to the emergency department with a painful swelling in his left elbow joint following a minor fall while playing basketball. He has been on prophylactic treatment with recombinant factor IX concentrate for several years now but missed his last dose two days ago due to travel. On examination, there is significant effusion and tenderness over the joint, and an X-ray shows no bony abnormalities. The patient's factor IX level is found to be less than 1% of normal. What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Aspiration of the joint followed by immobilization
B. Administration of recombinant factor IX concentrate
C. Administration of tranexamic acid
D. Surgical intervention to remove blood from the joint 
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In patients with haemophilia B, bleeding into joints can cause significant pain and disability if not treated promptly even when they are on prophylaxis therapy; missing doses increases their risk further. Management involves administration of replacement therapy with recombinant factor IX concentrate or cryoprecipitate as well as surgical intervention (arthrocentesis) to remove accumulated blood from the joint space if necessary, followed by immobilization and physical therapy as needed for recovery purposes.

Question
A 7-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a rash on his lower limbs and buttocks, joint pain, and abdominal discomfort. On examination, he has palpable purpura over his legs and buttocks, tenderness in his knee joints, and mild epigastric tenderness. His urine dipstick shows microscopic haematuria but no proteinuria. Blood tests reveal elevated inflammatory markers and normal renal function. The diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura is made.

Which one of the following statements regarding Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is correct? 

A. HSP is more common in adults than children.
B. HSP is caused by an autoimmune reaction against vascular endothelium.
C. HSP can present with severe hypertension as a complication.
D. HSP can be treated with high-dose steroids alone.
E. HSP carries a risk of long-term renal impairment.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Although most cases of HSP are self-limiting and resolve within weeks without specific treatment, some patients may develop complications such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal failure due to glomerulonephritis. Children are more commonly affected than adults, and the pathogenesis of HSP is not fully understood but thought to involve immune complex deposition in small blood vessels leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Severe hypertension is rare in HSP but can occur as a result of renal involvement requiring prompt management with antihypertensive drugs.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent episodes of palpable purpura over her lower limbs associated with arthralgia for the past year. She also reports occasional abdominal pain and diarrhoea during these episodes that last for several days before resolving spontaneously without any specific treatment. Her physical examination reveals tender nodules on her shins and ankles, and her blood tests show elevated inflammatory markers, eosinophilia, and positive p-ANCA. A skin biopsy confirms leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Henoch-Schonlein purpura
B. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)
C. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
D. Allergic granulomatosis (Churg-Strauss syndrome)
E. Microscopic polyangitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical features of this patient are suggestive of Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare systemic vasculitis characterized by asthma, eosinophilia, and small-vessel vasculitis that can affect multiple organs including lungs, skin, nerves, and kidneys. HSP typically presents in childhood or early adulthood with palpable purpura over lower limbs and buttocks associated with joint pain and abdominal discomfort but rarely involves other organs such as lungs or nerves. GPA and microscopic polyangiitis are also forms of small-vessel vasculitis but have different clinical features and laboratory findings than Churg-Strauss syndrome.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of recurrent episodes of painful blisters on his feet for the past year that heal slowly leaving scars behind. He also reports occasional joint pain in his hands that is worse in the morning but improves during the day without any specific treatment. His medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, and previous myocardial infarction managed with aspirin and statins.

On examination, he has multiple crusted erosions on his toes bilaterally with mild tenderness over metatarsophalangeal joints but no synovial swelling or erythema. Blood tests reveal raised inflammatory markers but negative rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies. A skin biopsy shows subepidermal bullae with neutrophilic infiltrate.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Bullous pemphigoid
B. Rheumatoid arthritis
C. Gout
D. Henoch-Schonlein purpura
E. Psoriatic arthritis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features of this patient are suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease that typically affects elderly patients and presents with pruritic urticarial plaques and tense blisters on flexural areas such as groin, axillae, or lower abdomen but can also involve extremities including feet. Joint involvement in bullous pemphigoid is rare and usually non-erosive without synovitis or deformity seen in rheumatoid arthritis or gout. HSP typically presents with palpable purpura over lower limbs and buttocks associated with joint pain and abdominal discomfort in children or young adults without significant comorbidities like hypertension or diabetes mellitus seen in this patient's history.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents with a history of fatigue, abdominal discomfort and weight loss over the past few months. He has no significant medical history but admits to excessive alcohol consumption for many years. On examination, he is jaundiced with hepatomegaly. Blood tests show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.

Further investigations reveal cirrhosis on ultrasound scan and a CT scan shows multiple hepatic nodules consistent with HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma). The patient is referred for further management.

Which of the following risk factors is most strongly associated with the development of HCC? 

A. Hepatitis B virus infection
B. Hepatitis C virus infection
C. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
D. Autoimmune hepatitis
E. Primary sclerosing cholangitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Chronic hepatitis B or C infections are well-known risk factors for developing HCC due to their ability to cause chronic inflammation in the liver leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis which can progress to cancerous changes in hepatocytes.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with symptoms of acute viral hepatitis including fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting and right upper quadrant pain along with dark urine and pale stools. She reports having unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners over the past year and also admits to injecting drugs occasionally.

Blood tests show raised transaminases along with positive serology for both HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) and anti-HCV antibodies indicating co-infection with both viruses.

Which of the following statements regarding this patient's condition is true? 

A. This patient should be started on antiviral therapy immediately.
B. Co-infection leads to more severe disease than mono-infection.
C. This patient has a higher risk of developing fulminant hepatic failure.
D. Vaccination against hepatitis A is not necessary in this patient.
E. This patient has a higher risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Co-infection with both HBV and HCV viruses can lead to more severe liver disease including cirrhosis and an increased risk of developing HCC compared to mono-infection. Vaccination against hepatitis A should also be recommended as co-infected patients have a higher risk of fulminant hepatic failure if they acquire acute hepatitis A infection.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with symptoms of chronic viral hepatitis including fatigue, abdominal discomfort and jaundice along with elevated liver enzymes on blood tests. He reports having received multiple blood transfusions for thalassemia major during childhood.

Further investigations reveal positive serology for anti-HCV antibodies indicating chronic HCV infection. The patient is started on antiviral therapy but develops worsening ascites and encephalopathy over the next few weeks despite treatment.

Which of the following complications is most likely responsible for his deteriorating clinical condition? 

A. Hepatocellular carcinoma
B. Portal vein thrombosis
C. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
D. Drug-induced liver injury
E. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Patients with advanced cirrhosis due to chronic viral hepatitis are at high risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) which can cause rapid deterioration in their clinical condition leading to sepsis, multiorgan failure and death if left untreated. Treatment involves prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics along with supportive care including paracentesis for symptomatic relief of ascites.

Question
A 70-year-old male presents with a painful, irreducible swelling in the right groin that has been present for several days. He denies any vomiting or bowel disturbance but reports constipation and difficulty passing urine. On examination, he is tachycardic, hypotensive, and has a tender right inguinal hernia that cannot be reduced manually. The abdomen is distended with absent bowel sounds and dullness on percussion in the lower quadrants.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Strangulated femoral hernia
B. Obstructed obturator hernia
C. Incarcerated direct inguinal hernia
D. Eviscerated umbilical hernia
E. Recurrent indirect inguinal hernia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with a strangulated femoral hernia, which occurs when the contents of the sac become ischemic due to pressure from the surrounding tissues leading to obstruction of blood flow resulting in necrosis.

Question
A 55-year-old female presents with an asymptomatic bulge in her left groin that she first noticed six months ago while lifting heavy objects at work. She has no significant past medical history and takes no medications regularly.
On examination, there is a reducible lump in the left groin region just below the inguinal ligament that disappears on lying flat but reappears on standing up or coughing.
What type of hernia does this patient have? 

A. Indirect inguinal hernia
B. Direct inguinal hernia
C. Femoral hernia 
D. Spigelian hernia 
E. Obturator hernia 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with a direct inguinal hernia, which occurs through weakness in the posterior wall of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric vessels.

Question
A 40-year-old male presents with a painful, irreducible swelling in his left groin that has been present for several hours. He reports nausea and vomiting but denies any bowel disturbance or difficulty passing urine.
On examination, he is tachycardic, hypotensive, and has a tender left inguinal hernia that cannot be reduced manually. The abdomen is distended with absent bowel sounds and dullness on percussion in the lower quadrants.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Strangulated indirect inguinal hernia
B. Obstructed obturator hernia 
C. Incarcerated femoral hernia 
D. Eviscerated incisional hernia 
E. Recurrent spigelian hernia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with an incarcerated femoral hernia, which occurs when abdominal contents become trapped within the femoral canal leading to obstruction of blood flow resulting in ischemia and necrosis if not treated promptly.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents with a painful rash on his left thigh that has been present for the past week. He reports feeling generally unwell and having a fever. On examination, there are multiple grouped vesicles on an erythematous base in a dermatomal distribution over the left thigh. The patient is diagnosed with herpes simplex virus infection.

Which of the following is true regarding the pathogenesis of herpes simplex virus? 

A. Herpes simplex virus enters host cells via endocytosis
B. The viral genome is replicated in the cytoplasm of infected cells
C. Viral assembly occurs in the nucleus of infected cells
D. The primary site of latency for herpes simplex virus type 1 is dorsal root ganglia
E. Herpes simplex virus type 2 can cause oral lesions

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) enters host cells via fusion with cell membranes rather than endocytosis, and its genome is replicated in the nucleus of infected cells rather than cytoplasmic replication as seen in some other viruses such as poxviruses. Assembly also occurs in the nucleus rather than cytoplasmic assembly as seen in many RNA viruses such as influenza or retroviruses like HIV. HSV-1 typically establishes latency within sensory neurons located near the trigeminal nerve ganglia, while HSV-2 usually establishes latency within sacral nerve ganglia near the spinal cord.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of recurrent episodes of genital ulcers over the past year that have not responded well to acyclovir therapy. She reports having unprotected sex with several partners during this time period and denies any history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Physical exam reveals several shallow ulcers on her vulva and cervix without lymphadenopathy or systemic symptoms.

What additional testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis? 

A. PCR for herpes simplex virus DNA from a swab of the ulcer base
B. Serology testing for herpes simplex virus antibodies
C. Culture of the ulcer base on viral transport medium
D. Biopsy of an ulcer edge for histopathologic examination
E. Blood cultures to rule out bacterial infection

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: While serology testing can be useful in identifying past exposure to HSV, it is not helpful in diagnosing active infections or determining whether recurrent genital ulcers are due to HSV-1 or HSV-2. Culture and biopsy can also be used to diagnose HSV but have lower sensitivity than PCR-based methods and may take several days to yield results. Therefore, PCR testing of a swab taken from the base of an ulcer is the most sensitive and specific method for confirming a clinical suspicion of genital herpes.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with severe pain and itching around his mouth that has been present for two days. He reports having had similar episodes in the past that resolved spontaneously within a week without treatment. On physical exam, there are multiple grouped vesicles on an erythematous base involving both lips.

What is the most appropriate management strategy? 

A. Oral acyclovir therapy for 7-10 days
B. Topical corticosteroid cream applied twice daily until symptoms resolve
C. Referral to dermatology for consideration of laser ablation therapy 
D. Observation only as lesions will likely resolve spontaneously 
E. Oral prednisone taper over 14 days

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Treatment options for acute herpes labialis (cold sores) include oral antiviral medications such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir which can reduce symptom duration by up to one day if started early enough in the course of illness (within 48 hours of symptom onset). Topical corticosteroids are not recommended for herpes labialis as they can worsen the infection and delay healing. Laser ablation therapy is not a first-line treatment option for herpes labialis, and observation only may lead to prolonged symptoms and increased risk of transmission. Oral prednisone is contraindicated in herpes simplex virus infections due to its immunosuppressive effects which can exacerbate viral replication and spread.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of heartburn and regurgitation for the past six months. He has been taking over-the-counter antacids, but they have not provided any relief. The patient also reports experiencing chest pain that radiates towards his left arm on exertion. On examination, there are no abnormal findings except for mild epigastric tenderness.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
B. Peptic ulcer disease
C. Hiatal hernia
D. Gastric cancer
E. Achalasia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation suggest GERD, which can be caused by hiatal hernia in some cases. The presence of chest pain on exertion raises concerns about cardiac involvement; however, it may also be due to GERD-related esophagitis or spasm of the esophagus.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents with dysphagia and weight loss for the past three months. She also reports experiencing postprandial fullness and bloating after meals, especially when lying down at night. Her medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both well-controlled with medication.
On examination, there are no significant findings except for mild epigastric tenderness.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Esophageal stricture 
B. Hiatal hernia 
C. Gastroparesis 
D. Gastric outlet obstruction 
E. Zenker diverticulum 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest gastroesophageal reflux secondary to hiatal hernia causing dysphagia and postprandial fullness/bloating.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute onset of severe epigastric pain and vomiting. The patient reports a history of heartburn and regurgitation for the past year, which he has been managing with over-the-counter antacids. On examination, there is diffuse abdominal tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute pancreatitis 
B. Peptic ulcer disease 
C. Hiatal hernia 
D. Gastric cancer 
E. Mesenteric ischemia 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest peptic ulcer disease, which can be caused by chronic acid reflux due to hiatal hernia in some cases. The presence of diffuse abdominal tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness raises concerns about perforation or peritonitis requiring urgent surgical intervention.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is admitted to the hospital for an exacerbation of his symptoms. He is started on antibiotics and steroids, but after a few days, he develops fever and worsening shortness of breath. His sputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit for further management.
Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate in managing this patient's hospital-acquired infection? 

A. Administering intravenous colistin
B. Continuing the current antibiotic regimen
C. Initiating mechanical ventilation
D. Placing the patient on contact isolation precautions
E. Obtaining a chest CT scan

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are often difficult to treat due to their resistance to many antibiotics commonly used in hospitals. Colistin is one of the few remaining options for treatment of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas infections.

Question
A 50-year-old woman undergoes surgery for a perforated duodenal ulcer and develops postoperative sepsis requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). She receives broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care, but her condition continues to deteriorate despite maximal therapy.
Which of the following organisms should be considered as a potential cause of her hospital-acquired infection? 

A. Escherichia coli
B. Streptococcus pneumoniae 
C. Klebsiella pneumoniae 
D. Staphylococcus aureus 
E. Haemophilus influenzae

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Patients in ICUs are at high risk for developing healthcare-associated infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Question
A 70-year-old man with end-stage renal disease is admitted to the hospital for a tunneled hemodialysis catheter insertion. He develops fever and chills on the second day after the procedure, and blood cultures grow methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient is started on vancomycin, but his fever persists.
Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate in managing this patient's hospital-acquired infection? 

A. Switching to daptomycin
B. Adding rifampin to the antibiotic regimen
C. Obtaining a transthoracic echocardiogram 
D. Removing the hemodialysis catheter
E. Initiating antifungal therapy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Patients with MRSA bacteremia are at risk for developing infective endocarditis, which can be detected by echocardiography.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a history of unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners. She is concerned about her risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and requests testing. The physician explains that HIV can be detected through various tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, these tests have different sensitivities and specificities depending on the stage of infection.
Which test would be most appropriate for detecting early acute HIV infection? What are the limitations of this test? 

A. ELISA
B. Western blot
C. PCR
D. Rapid antibody test
E. Viral culture

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: PCR is the most sensitive test for detecting early acute HIV infection because it amplifies viral RNA or DNA even when there are very few copies present in the blood. However, it may not detect all cases of acute infection due to variations in viral load and mutations in the virus.

Question
A 45-year-old man with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presents to his primary care physician with complaints of fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats over the past few months. On examination, he has cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.
What is the most likely diagnosis? Which opportunistic infections should be considered? 

A. Kaposi sarcoma; Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)
B. Tuberculosis; Cryptococcal meningitis
C. Lymphoma; Toxoplasmosis encephalitis
D. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; Candidiasis esophagitis 
E. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC); Cytomegalovirus retinitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The symptoms and signs described are consistent with lymphoma, which is a common malignancy in patients with HIV. Opportunistic infections that should be considered include Toxoplasmosis encephalitis, PJP, Cryptococcal meningitis, Candidiasis esophagitis, and Cytomegalovirus retinitis.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to the clinic for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) counseling as he has multiple sexual partners and wants to reduce his risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The physician explains that PrEP involves taking antiretroviral medication before exposure to HIV to prevent infection.
Which medication is commonly used for PrEP? What are the potential side effects? 

A. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine; Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
B. Raltegravir; Headache, insomnia
C. Darunavir/cobicistat; Rash, liver toxicity
D. Efavirenz/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; Dizziness, abnormal dreams 
E. Atazanavir/ritonavir; Hyperbilirubinemia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine is the most commonly used medication for PrEP due to its high efficacy and tolerability. Potential side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, these usually resolve within a few weeks of starting treatment.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP with a complaint of persistent vaginal discharge and itching for the past six months. On examination, she is found to have multiple small lesions on her vulva that are painless but bleed easily upon touch. She reports having had unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the past year. A swab test confirms the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) type 16. What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient? 

A. Prescribe topical corticosteroids
B. Perform a biopsy of the lesions
C. Administer antiviral therapy
D. Refer for surgical excision of the lesions 
E. Recommend vaccination against HPV

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest anogenital warts caused by HPV infection, specifically type 16 which is associated with high risk of cervical cancer. Treatment options include topical agents such as imiquimod or podophyllotoxin, cryotherapy, electrocautery or surgical excision depending on the extent and severity of lesions involved. In this case, given the persistence and bleeding tendency of the warts, referral for surgical removal would be most appropriate.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of painful urination and penile discharge for two weeks duration following unprotected sex with a new partner he met at a bar three weeks ago. He has no significant medical history and denies any drug allergies or recent travel outside UK.
On examination, there is mild erythema around his urethral meatus and purulent discharge from it upon gentle pressure.
What is the most likely causative organism? 

A. Chlamydia trachomatis
B. Neisseria gonorrhoeae
C. Treponema pallidum
D. Human papilloma virus
E. Herpes simplex virus

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of urethritis caused by gonococcal infection, which is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the UK. Chlamydia trachomatis is another common cause of urethritis but typically presents with less severe symptoms and more watery discharge. Treponema pallidum causes syphilis, which can present with genital ulcers but not purulent discharge. HPV infection may cause genital warts or cervical cancer in women but does not usually cause urethritis or penile discharge. Herpes simplex virus may cause painful vesicular lesions on the genitals but not necessarily associated with urethral discharge.

Question
A 45-year-old woman attends her routine gynecological check-up and is found to have an abnormal Pap smear result showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). She has no significant medical history and denies any recent vaginal bleeding or pain.
What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Repeat Pap smear in six months
B. Perform colposcopy with biopsy 
C. Administer antiviral therapy for human papilloma virus 
D. Refer for hysterectomy 
E. Recommend vaccination against HPV 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: ASC-US is a common finding on Pap smears that indicates some degree of cellular changes in the cervix that are not clearly indicative of precancerous or cancerous lesions, but could be due to inflammation, infection or other benign conditions such as hormonal changes or trauma from intercourse. Therefore, it is recommended to repeat the Pap smear in six months to monitor any progression or regression of these changes before considering further diagnostic tests such as colposcopy or biopsy. Antiviral therapy for HPV would not be indicated unless there is evidence of high-risk strains causing persistent abnormalities on follow-up testing. Hysterectomy would be an extreme measure reserved for cases of confirmed cervical cancer or other serious gynecological conditions. Vaccination against HPV is recommended for individuals who have not been previously exposed to the virus, but would not affect the management of existing abnormal Pap smear results.

Question
A 60-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presents to the emergency department with confusion, constipation and polyuria for the past week. She has been receiving chemotherapy for her metastatic disease for the past six months. On examination, she is found to have hypertension and dehydration. Blood tests reveal hypercalcaemia of 3.2 mmol/L, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and low phosphate levels.
Which of the following is the most likely cause of her hypercalcaemia? 

A. Vitamin D toxicity
B. Primary hyperparathyroidism 
C. Multiple myeloma 
D. Sarcoidosis 
E. Hyperthyroidism

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HCM), which commonly occurs in patients with advanced cancers such as multiple myeloma, lymphoma or breast cancer that has spread to the bones. The other options are less likely causes of HCM.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with fatigue, nausea and vomiting for two weeks along with increased thirst and urination over the last few days. He has a history of prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy three years ago but was recently diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma that has metastasized to his liver and bones.
Laboratory investigations show serum calcium level at 3 mmol/L, PTH-related protein (PTHrP) level at 120 pmol/L (normal range <2 pmol/L) and normal parathyroid hormone levels.
What is the underlying mechanism causing this patient's hypercalcaemia? 

A. Increased osteoblastic activity
B. Renal failure
C. Excessive vitamin D intake
D. Ectopic secretion of PTHrP by tumour cells
E. Hypoparathyroidism

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HHM), which occurs due to the secretion of PTHrP by tumour cells. This leads to increased bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption, resulting in hypercalcaemia. The other options are less likely causes of HHM.

Question
A 70-year-old woman presents with confusion, constipation and abdominal pain for two weeks along with a history of breast cancer that was treated successfully five years ago. On examination, she has hypertension and dehydration.
Laboratory investigations show serum calcium level at 3.5 mmol/L, low phosphate levels and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels.
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Intravenous fluids
B. Bisphosphonates 
C. Calcitonin 
D. Glucocorticoids 
E. Chemotherapy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with HCM, which can cause severe symptoms such as confusion and dehydration if left untreated. Initial management should focus on correcting fluid deficits with intravenous fluids followed by treatment with bisphosphonates or calcitonin to lower serum calcium levels. Glucocorticoids may be used in patients with lymphoma or myeloma causing HCM, but not in this case as there is no evidence of these conditions currently present in the patient. Chemotherapy may also be considered depending on the underlying malignancy causing HCM but would not be an appropriate initial management strategy for acute symptomatic relief.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of hyperlipidemia presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. On examination, he has tenderness in the epigastric region and elevated serum lipase levels. Imaging studies reveal acute pancreatitis.

Further investigation reveals that the patient has a rare genetic disorder characterized by an autosomal dominant mutation in the gene encoding for apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II). This protein is necessary for which process? 

A. Binding of chylomicrons to LDL receptors
B. Activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL)
C. Formation of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs)
D. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase
E. Promotion of reverse cholesterol transport

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: ApoC-II is required as a cofactor for LPL, which hydrolyzes triglycerides from circulating chylomicrons and VLDLs into free fatty acids and glycerol, allowing them to be taken up by peripheral tissues such as adipose tissue or muscle.

Question
A 55-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to her primary care physician for routine follow-up. She reports compliance with her medications, including metformin and insulin glargine, but expresses concern about her recent lipid profile results.

Her fasting lipid panel shows total cholesterol 5.9 mmol/L, HDL-C 1.2 mmol/L, LDL-C 3.8 mmol/L, and triglycerides 2.4 mmol/L.

Which medication would be most appropriate to add to this patient's regimen? 

A) Ezetimibe 
B) Fenofibrate 
C) Niacin 
D) Omega-3 fatty acid supplements 
E) PCSK9 inhibitor

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or familial hypercholesterolemia, PCSK9 inhibitors have been shown to reduce LDL-C levels by up to 60%. They are typically reserved for patients who cannot tolerate statins or who require additional LDL-C lowering despite maximally tolerated statin therapy.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with complaints of fatigue and exertional dyspnea. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin.

On examination, the patient is noted to have an enlarged liver and spleen. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum ferritin levels and low HDL-C levels.

Which genetic disorder should be considered in this patient? 

A) Familial combined hyperlipidemia 
B) Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
C) Lipoprotein lipase deficiency 
D) Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
E) Hereditary hemochromatosis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption leading to iron overload in various organs including the liver, pancreas, heart, and joints. This can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism/amenorrhea, arthropathy/joint pain as well as increased risk of infections. Low HDL cholesterol may also be present due to impaired reverse cholesterol transport caused by iron deposition in macrophages.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with confusion and lethargy. He has been feeling unwell for the past week, with polyuria and polydipsia. His blood glucose level is found to be 50mmol/L, and serum osmolarity is elevated at 380 mmol/L (278-305 mmol/L). Urinalysis shows no ketones or leukocytes.

On examination, he appears dehydrated, with dry mucous membranes and poor skin turgor. His blood pressure is low at 90/60 mmHg, and his heart rate is elevated at 110 beats per minute. Laboratory tests reveal an elevated creatinine level of 200 Âµmol/L (60-120 Âµmol/L) and a low bicarbonate level of 10 mmol/l.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?

A. Administer insulin bolus
B. Initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation
C. Perform arterial blood gas analysis
D. Order computed tomography scan of head
E. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), which is characterized by severe dehydration due to osmotic diuresis from high blood glucose levels (>33mmol/L) without significant ketoacidosis (<3mmol/L). Initial management should focus on aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline solution to correct hypovolemia, improve renal perfusion, and decrease serum osmolarity.

Question
A 58-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department after being found unconscious at home by her family members. She has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia but takes no medications regularly.

Initial laboratory investigations show a blood glucose level of 60mmol/L and serum osmolarity of 350 mmol/L (278-305 mmol/L). Urinalysis reveals no ketones or leukocytes. A computed tomography scan of the head is normal.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?

A. Hypoglycemia
B. Diabetic ketoacidosis
C. Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state
D. Cerebrovascular accident
E. Drug overdose

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's clinical picture suggests severe hypoglycemia, which can result from excessive insulin use, decreased food intake, or other medications that lower blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. Hypoglycemia can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and coma if left untreated.

Question
A 70-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with confusion and lethargy for the past day.

Laboratory tests reveal an elevated creatinine level of 200 Âµmol/L (60-120 Âµmol/L) and a low bicarbonate level of 10 mmol/l.

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Administer intravenous insulin infusion
B. Initiate continuous renal replacement therapy
C. Perform echocardiogram
D. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
E. Start prophylactic anticoagulation therapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests severe hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), which can lead to acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia, dehydration, and osmotic diuresis. In patients with HHS and renal failure, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be necessary to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances, improve metabolic derangements, and prevent further complications.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent kidney stones and bone pain for the past year. She has been diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism based on elevated serum calcium levels, low phosphate levels, and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with HGA caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which can cause fever, headache, myalgias, and hepatosplenomegaly in post-splenectomy patients.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. She has a history of autoimmune disease and is currently taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. Her blood tests show elevated levels of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). The GP suspects that the patient may have Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Which of the following statements about Hashimoto's thyroiditis is true? 

A. It is more common in men than women
B. It typically presents with hyperthyroidism symptoms
C. Treatment involves surgical removal of the thyroid gland
D. Patients are at increased risk for developing other autoimmune diseases
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism. It is more common in women than men and often presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Treatment typically involves hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine, but surgery may be necessary in rare cases where there is significant enlargement or nodularity of the thyroid gland. Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are also at increased risk for developing other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of irregular periods, hair loss, and dry skin. Blood tests reveal low levels of TSH and free T4 within normal limits.

Which one of the following conditions could cause these results? 

A. Pituitary adenoma 
B. Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis 
C. Iodine deficiency 
D. Congenital hypothyroidism 
E. Secondary adrenal insufficiency 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Secondary adrenal insufficiency can cause low levels of TSH and free T4 within normal limits. This is because the pituitary gland, which produces TSH, relies on signals from the hypothalamus to function properly. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, there is a deficiency in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands. This leads to decreased feedback inhibition of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and subsequently decreased secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. TRH normally stimulates the release of TSH from the pituitary gland, so decreased TRH results in lower levels of TSH.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Blood tests reveal elevated levels of TSH and low levels of free T4.

Which one of the following conditions could cause these results? 

A. Primary hypothyroidism 
B. Subclinical hyperthyroidism 
C. Thyroid storm 
D. Secondary hypothyroidism 
E. Euthyroid sick syndrome 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when there is a problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus that prevents them from producing enough thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), respectively. This leads to decreased stimulation of the thyroid gland and subsequent low levels of free T4 despite elevated levels of TSH. Common causes include tumors or radiation therapy affecting the pituitary or hypothalamus, as well as certain medications such as glucocorticoids or dopamine agonists. Symptoms are similar to those seen in primary hypothyroidism but may be more severe due to additional hormonal deficiencies caused by dysfunction in other parts of the endocrine system.

D. Ischaemic colitis 
E. Diverticular disease

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation along with laboratory findings and imaging suggest mesenteric venous thrombosis as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of crampy abdominal pain after meals associated with bloating, diarrhoea and weight loss over several months duration. She has no significant past medical history but smokes cigarettes regularly for many years now. Physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the epigastric region without any signs of peritonism or organomegaly.
What would be the most appropriate initial investigation? 

A. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
B. Colonoscopy
C. Abdominal ultrasound
D. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan
E. Faecal calprotectin test

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms, risk factors and physical exam findings, contrast-enhanced CT scan would be the most appropriate initial investigation to evaluate for possible mesenteric artery stenosis or occlusion.

Question
A 70-year-old male smoker presents to his GP with chronic constipation alternating with diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia but no previous gastrointestinal problems. On examination, there is mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant without any palpable masses or organomegaly.
Which one of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Flexible sigmoidoscopy
B. Colonoscopy 
C. Abdominal ultrasound 
D. CT colonography 
E. Barium enema

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Given the patient's age, symptoms and risk factors, colonoscopy would be the most appropriate investigation to evaluate for possible colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease as well as mesenteric artery stenosis or occlusion causing chronic mesenteric ischaemia.

Question
A 62-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of severe abdominal pain and vomiting. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, he appears uncomfortable and is writhing in pain. His abdomen is distended, tympanic to percussion, and tender on palpation throughout all quadrants. Bowel sounds are absent on auscultation. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated white blood cell count and metabolic acidosis.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen reveals dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels consistent with small bowel obstruction.
Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation? 

A. Adhesions
B. Hernia
C. Intussusception 
D. Volvulus 
E. Neoplasm

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical scenario described above is suggestive of small bowel obstruction which can be caused by various etiologies including adhesions, hernias, intussusception, volvulus or neoplasms among others. However, given that there are no previous surgeries or hernias noted in the patientâs history or physical exam respectively; it makes these options less likely as causes of his current presentation. Furthermore, neoplastic obstructions tend to present more gradually over time rather than acutely like in this case making it an unlikely diagnosis as well.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of recurrent episodes of bloating and constipation over the last few months along with occasional nausea and vomiting after meals despite having a good appetite otherwise. She denies any recent changes in diet or medication use but reports a family history positive for colon cancer in both her parents who were diagnosed at ages 50 and 52 years old respectively.
On examination, her abdomen is mildly distended with no tenderness or rebound. Bowel sounds are present and normal in character. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and thyroid function tests are all within normal limits.
Which of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate for evaluating this patient? 

A. Abdominal X-ray 
B. Barium enema
C. CT colonography
D. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE)
E. Upper gastrointestinal series

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical scenario described above is suggestive of a possible colonic obstruction which can have various etiologies including malignancy among others given the family history positive for colon cancer in both parents at relatively young ages. Therefore, an imaging modality that allows visualization of the entire colon such as CT colonography would be most appropriate to evaluate this patientâs symptoms.

Question
A 58-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 48-hour history of abdominal pain and distension along with multiple episodes of vomiting containing undigested food particles but no bile or blood noted. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which he uses inhalers regularly.
On examination, his abdomen is markedly distended with diffuse tenderness on palpation but without any guarding or rigidity noted. Bowel sounds are absent on auscultation.
Laboratory investigations reveal elevated white blood cell count and metabolic acidosis while plain abdominal radiographs show dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels consistent with small bowel obstruction.
Given the clinical scenario described above, what is the most likely cause? 

A. Adhesions 
B. Hernia 
C. Intussusception 
D. Volvulus 
E. Neoplasm

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation described above is suggestive of small bowel obstruction which can be caused by various etiologies including adhesions, hernias, intussusception, volvulus or neoplasms among others. However, given that the patient has a past medical history of COPD and uses inhalers regularly; it makes him more prone to developing adhesions due to frequent surgeries for respiratory issues in the past. Therefore, adhesions are the most likely cause of this patientâs presentation.

Question
A 2-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stools. He has a history of recurrent episodes of colicky abdominal pain over the past few months. On examination, there is tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. An ultrasound scan reveals an ileocolic intussusception.

Which one of the following statements regarding intussusception is correct? 

A. Intussusception is more common in girls than boys.
B. The most common site for intussusception is jejunojejunal.
C. Ultrasound scan is not a reliable diagnostic tool for intussusception.
D. Treatment of choice for intussusception is surgical resection.
E. Recurrence rate after non-operative reduction of intussusception is less than 5%.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Intussusception commonly occurs in children between 3 months and 3 years old, with a male predominance. The most common site for intussusception is ileocolic (90%). Ultrasound scan has high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing intussusception but may miss cases if performed by inexperienced operators or if there are concurrent bowel pathologies that mimic its appearance on imaging studies. Non-operative reduction using air enema or hydrostatic pressure under fluoroscopic guidance can be successful in up to 80% of cases, with recurrence rates ranging from 10-15%. Surgical resection may be necessary if non-operative reduction fails or if there are signs of intestinal ischemia.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with intermittent crampy abdominal pain and diarrhoea over the past year. She also reports passing mucus per rectum occasionally. There is no significant weight loss or rectal bleeding noted on further questioning. Colonoscopy shows multiple polyps throughout her colon, which were removed during the procedure. Histology reveals a tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.

Which one of the following is the most appropriate management? 

A. Observation and repeat colonoscopy in 5 years.
B. Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis.
C. Subtotal colectomy with end-ileostomy.
D. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
E. Endoscopic mucosal resection of polyps.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Patients with multiple colonic polyps, especially those with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma, are at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). The presence of multiple polyps suggests a diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), both of which have significant implications for surveillance and management. In this case, the patient's age and histological findings suggest FAP as a likely diagnosis. Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is recommended to prevent CRC development in patients with FAP who have rectal sparing.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of abdominal pain, bloating, constipation alternating with diarrhoea, and weight loss over the past few months. He has no significant medical history but reports smoking cigarettes for over 40 years. On examination, there is diffuse tenderness on palpation of the abdomen without any signs of peritonitis or organomegaly noted.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Abdominal X-ray.
B. Colonoscopy.
C. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
D. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
E. Stool culture for bacterial pathogens.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's symptoms are suggestive of malignancy involving the gastrointestinal tract, possibly colon cancer. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is the most appropriate investigation to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or metastatic disease. Abdominal X-ray may show signs of bowel obstruction but has limited sensitivity in detecting early-stage malignancies. Colonoscopy would be necessary for tissue diagnosis and staging, but it may not be feasible if there is significant colonic distension or obstruction. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy would not provide useful information in this case as the symptoms suggest lower GI involvement. Stool culture would be indicated if there were signs of infectious diarrhoea but is unlikely to yield a definitive diagnosis in this context.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe eye pain, photophobia and blurred vision in her right eye. She reports a history of psoriasis but is otherwise healthy. On examination, there is ciliary injection, corneal edema and a small hypopyon in the anterior chamber of her right eye. The left eye appears normal. Visual acuity in the affected eye is reduced to counting fingers at one meter.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
B. Anterior uveitis 
C. Posterior uveitis 
D. Endophthalmitis 
E. Scleritis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute anterior uveitis, which is characterized by ciliary injection, corneal edema and inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye (hypopyon). Acute angle-closure glaucoma typically presents with sudden onset of severe ocular pain associated with nausea and vomiting, halos around lights, and a fixed mid-dilated pupil. Posterior uveitis usually presents with floaters or decreased visual acuity due to inflammation in the posterior segment of the eye (vitreous or retina). Endophthalmitis can occur after intraocular surgery or trauma and presents with severe pain, redness, decreased vision and often purulent discharge from the eye. Scleritis typically causes deep ocular pain that worsens with eye movement and may be associated with systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to his optometrist complaining of blurry vision and sensitivity to light in his left eye for several days. He has no significant medical history but admits to occasional use of recreational drugs including cocaine and ecstasy on weekends.

On examination, there is moderate conjunctival injection, a small hypopyon in the anterior chamber of his left eye and posterior synechiae. Visual acuity is reduced to 6/18 in the affected eye.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
B. Anterior uveitis 
C. Posterior uveitis 
D. Endophthalmitis 
E. Scleritis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute anterior uveitis, which is characterized by conjunctival injection, inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye (hypopyon) and adhesions between the iris and lens (posterior synechiae). Recreational drug use has been associated with increased risk of developing uveitis due to direct toxicity or immune-mediated mechanisms. Acute angle-closure glaucoma typically presents with sudden onset of severe ocular pain associated with nausea and vomiting, halos around lights, and a fixed mid-dilated pupil. Posterior uveitis usually presents with floaters or decreased visual acuity due to inflammation in the posterior segment of the eye (vitreous or retina). Endophthalmitis can occur after intraocular surgery or trauma and presents with severe pain, redness, decreased vision and often purulent discharge from the eye. Scleritis typically causes deep ocular pain that worsens with eye movement and may be associated with systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to his ophthalmologist complaining of recurrent episodes of redness, pain and photophobia in both eyes over several months. He reports a history of ankylosing spondylitis for which he takes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs daily.

On examination, there is bilateral ciliary injection, keratic precipitates on the corneal endothelium and posterior synechiae. Visual acuity is reduced to 6/12 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
B. Anterior uveitis 
C. Posterior uveitis 
D. Endophthalmitis 
E. Scleritis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic anterior uveitis, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye (keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae) and may be associated with systemic autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can exacerbate uveitis or mask its symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Acute angle-closure glaucoma typically presents with sudden onset of severe ocular pain associated with nausea and vomiting, halos around lights, and a fixed mid-dilated pupil. Posterior uveitis usually presents with floaters or decreased visual acuity due to inflammation in the posterior segment of the eye (vitreous or retina). Endophthalmitis can occur after intraocular surgery or trauma and presents with severe pain, redness, decreased vision and often purulent discharge from the eye. Scleritis typically causes deep ocular pain that worsens with eye movement and may be associated with systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to his GP with a history of recurrent abdominal pain, bloating and alternating diarrhoea and constipation for the past year. He reports that these symptoms are often triggered by stress or certain foods such as spicy or fatty meals. The patient denies any rectal bleeding, weight loss or family history of bowel disease. On examination, there is no evidence of abdominal tenderness or organomegaly.
Which of the following investigations would be most useful in differentiating between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?

A. Colonoscopy with biopsy
B. Abdominal ultrasound scan
C. Faecal occult blood test
D. Hydrogen breath test
E. Faecal calprotectin

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits without any structural abnormalities on investigation whereas IBD is an autoimmune condition causing inflammation and ulceration of the gut lining leading to diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss and other systemic symptoms which can be diagnosed through colonoscopy with biopsy, faecal calprotectin levels etc.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of intermittent lower abdominal cramps associated with bloating, flatulence and loose stools for several months now. She has noticed that her symptoms worsen during menstruation but improve after defecation or passing gas. There is no significant medical history except for mild asthma controlled on inhalers.
What would be the most appropriate management option for this patient?

A. Start loperamide regularly
B. Prescribe antibiotics empirically 
C. Recommend dietary changes including increased fibre intake 
D. Refer for sigmoidoscopy 
E. Advise psychotherapy 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Management options for IBS include lifestyle modifications like dietary changes including increasing fibre intake, probiotics, stress management techniques and medications like antispasmodics, laxatives or antidepressants depending on the predominant symptoms.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to his GP with a history of recurrent abdominal pain, bloating and alternating diarrhoea and constipation for several months now. He reports that these symptoms are often triggered by certain foods such as dairy products or wheat gluten. The patient denies any rectal bleeding, weight loss or family history of bowel disease. On examination, there is no evidence of abdominal tenderness or organomegaly.
Which of the following tests would be most useful in diagnosing lactose intolerance in this patient? 

A. Hydrogen breath test
B. Coeliac screen 
C. Stool culture 
D. Serum IgE levels 
E. Abdominal ultrasound scan

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Lactose intolerance is a common cause of IBS-like symptoms which can be diagnosed through hydrogen breath testing after ingestion of lactose-containing food items where increased levels of exhaled hydrogen indicate malabsorption due to lactase deficiency in the gut leading to fermentation by colonic bacteria causing gas production and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with chest pain and shortness of breath that has been ongoing for the past 2 hours. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and smoking. On examination, he is diaphoretic and tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 bpm. His blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, and his oxygen saturation on room air is 92%. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V4.

What is the most appropriate management option for this patient?

A. Thrombolytic therapy
B. Coronary angiography within 24 hours
C. Immediate coronary angiography
D. Conservative medical management
E. Cardiac rehabilitation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presentation suggests an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which requires immediate reperfusion therapy via primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Option A (thrombolytic therapy) may be considered if PCI cannot be performed within 120 minutes of first medical contact or if there are contraindications to PCI. Option B (coronary angiography within 24 hours) may be considered for patients who present late (>12-24 hours after symptom onset) or have non-ST-elevation ACS but not for STEMI patients who require urgent revascularization. Option D (conservative medical management) is not appropriate as it delays definitive treatment and increases morbidity/mortality risk.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of angina despite optimal medical therapy including aspirin, beta-blocker, nitrate, calcium channel blocker, and statin therapy over the last year. She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery five years ago due to triple-vessel disease involving the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA). A recent stress echocardiogram showed evidence of reversible ischaemia in the LAD territory.

What is the most appropriate management option for this patient?

A. Repeat CABG surgery
B. Percutaneous coronary intervention to the LAD
C. Medical therapy optimization
D. Enhanced external counterpulsation therapy
E. Coronary artery stenting

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient has recurrent angina despite optimal medical therapy and evidence of ischaemia in the LAD territory, which suggests significant graft failure or progression of native vessel disease requiring revascularization. Option A (repeat CABG surgery) may be considered if there are multiple graft failures or diffuse distal disease not amenable to PCI. Option C (medical therapy optimization) should always be done but unlikely to relieve symptoms in this case. Option D (enhanced external counterpulsation therapy) is a non-invasive treatment modality that may improve symptoms but not recommended as first-line treatment for patients with severe symptomatic CAD like this patient. Option E (coronary artery stenting) may be considered if PCI to the LAD can achieve complete revascularization.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion that has been ongoing for several months despite optimal medical therapy including aspirin, beta-blocker, nitrate, calcium channel blocker, and statin therapy over the last year. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to his left anterior descending (LAD) artery six years ago due to significant stenosis but had no further interventions since then. His echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 35% with regional wall motion abnormalities involving the anterior wall.

What is the most appropriate management option for this patient?

A. Repeat PCI to the LAD
B. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery
C. Medical therapy optimization
D. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)
E. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient has ongoing symptoms despite optimal medical therapy, significant stenosis in the past and now has evidence of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and regional wall motion abnormalities involving the anterior wall, which suggests diffuse CAD requiring complete revascularization via CABG surgery rather than repeat PCI to a single vessel. Option A (repeat PCI to the LAD) may not address other diseased vessels or improve overall prognosis compared to CABG surgery. Option C (medical therapy optimization) should always be done but unlikely to relieve symptoms in this case. Options D and E are indicated for patients with severe systolic dysfunction who meet specific criteria based on guidelines but not first-line treatment for symptomatic CAD like this patient.

Question
A 5-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a high-grade fever, red eyes, and swollen hands and feet. His parents report that he has been unwell for the past week with a persistent fever, rash, and irritability. On examination, the child is found to have bilateral conjunctivitis, cracked lips, and a diffuse erythematous rash over his trunk and extremities. He also has swelling of his hands and feet with desquamation of the skin on his fingers and toes.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Kawasaki disease
B. Measles
C. Scarlet Fever
D. Toxic Shock Syndrome
E. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presentation of this child is consistent with Kawasaki disease which is an acute febrile illness characterized by mucocutaneous inflammation affecting multiple organ systems including coronary arteries in some cases.

Question
A 3-year-old girl presents to her GP with a history of fever for five days associated with vomiting and diarrhea followed by development of a non-pruritic rash over her body especially involving her palms and soles. She was recently treated for otitis media at another clinic but did not improve much despite antibiotics.

On examination she appears irritable but alert; there are no signs of dehydration or respiratory distress; however she does have bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy along with mild pharyngeal erythema.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Kawasaki disease 
B. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease 
C. Roseola infantum 
D. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome 
E. Stevens-Johnson syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's clinical features suggest Kawasaki disease which can present as prolonged fever accompanied by other symptoms such as rash, lymphadenopathy, oral changes (e.g., strawberry tongue), and extremity changes (e.g., erythema, edema).

Question
A 7-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a high-grade fever for five days associated with vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. He has been diagnosed with Kawasaki disease in the past and was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.

On examination, he appears unwell but is alert; there are no signs of respiratory distress or dehydration; however he does have bilateral conjunctivitis along with diffuse erythematous rash over his trunk and extremities. His lips appear dry and cracked.

What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Repeat intravenous immunoglobulin therapy 
B. Start aspirin therapy 
C. Administer antibiotics 
D. Observe and reassess after 24 hours
E. Perform echocardiography

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient's history of Kawasaki disease puts him at risk for coronary artery aneurysms which can lead to long-term complications such as myocardial infarction or sudden death. Therefore, it is important to perform echocardiography to assess for any cardiac involvement despite previous treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with fatigue, fever, and night sweats for the past month. She reports a history of autoimmune disorders and has been on immunosuppressive therapy for several years. Her blood work reveals pancytopenia and a bone marrow biopsy shows dysplastic changes in all three lineages along with increased blasts. Flow cytometry analysis confirms a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with excess blasts-2 (EB-2). The patient is started on chemotherapy but develops severe neutropenia and sepsis requiring admission to the intensive care unit.

Which of the following supportive measures would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
B. Erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA)
C. Platelet transfusions
D. Red blood cell transfusions
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Patients with MDS may require supportive measures such as red blood cell or platelet transfusions, erythropoietin stimulating agents or G-CSF depending on their specific clinical presentation and disease characteristics. In patients with high-risk MDS or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), prophylactic use of G-CSF can reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia and infections associated with chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats over the past few months. His medical history is significant for hypertension and he takes medications for it regularly. On examination, there are no palpable lymph nodes or hepatosplenomegaly noted but there is mild pallor present. Blood tests reveal normocytic anaemia, leukocytosis with absolute lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. A peripheral blood smear shows smudge cells.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
B. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
C. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
D. Hodgkin's lymphoma
E. Mantle cell lymphoma

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of CLL can be variable but typically includes fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly in some cases. Peripheral blood findings may show leukocytosis with absolute lymphocytosis and smudge cells on a peripheral blood smear due to fragile neoplastic B-cells that are easily disrupted during sample preparation.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her gynaecologist with heavy menstrual bleeding for the past six months along with easy bruising and petechiae on her skin. She has no significant medical history but reports a family history of haematological malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in her younger brother who was treated successfully two years ago. Blood tests reveal anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated white cell count with blasts present on the peripheral blood smear.

Which of the following cytogenetic abnormalities is most commonly associated with ALL? 

A. t(9;22)(q34;q11)
B. t(15;17)(q22;q12)
C. t(8;21)(q22;q22)
D. inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22)
E. Hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes)

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Cytogenetic analysis plays an important role in risk stratification and treatment planning for patients with ALL as different genetic abnormalities are associated with varying prognosis and response to therapy. Hyperdiploidy, defined as having more than 50 chromosomes in the leukemic cells, is one of the most common cytogenetic abnormalities seen in ALL and is generally associated with a favourable outcome.

Question
A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. He has a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. On examination, he is jaundiced and has ascites.
Laboratory studies reveal elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count and prolonged prothrombin time.
An ultrasound shows evidence of portal hypertension and splenomegaly.
Which of the following complications is this patient at risk for? 
A. Hepatocellular carcinoma
B. Budd-Chiari syndrome
C. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
D. Acute pancreatitis
E. Cholecystitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is an infection in the fluid that accumulates in the abdomen due to liver failure. SBP can cause life-threatening complications such as sepsis and kidney failure.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort for several months. She has no significant past medical history but admits to drinking heavily on weekends.
On examination, she appears malnourished and has hepatosplenomegaly.
Laboratory studies reveal elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and coagulopathy.
A diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is made.
Which of the following medications should be avoided in this patient? 
A. Metronidazole
B. Prednisolone
C. Naltrexone
D. Disulfiram
E. Diazepam

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Benzodiazepines such as diazepam should be avoided in patients with alcoholic hepatitis because they can worsen hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver failure characterized by confusion, altered mental status and coma.

Question
A 50-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C presents to his GP with jaundice, abdominal pain and dark urine for the last week. He denies any alcohol or drug use.
On examination, he is icteric and has hepatomegaly.
Laboratory studies reveal elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and prolonged prothrombin time.
An ultrasound shows evidence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
Which of the following complications is this patient at risk for? 
A. Acute pancreatitis
B. Hepatocellular carcinoma
C. Esophageal varices bleeding
D. Cholangitis
E. Gallbladder perforation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk for developing esophageal varices due to increased pressure in the veins that supply blood to the liver (portal hypertension). These varices can rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding if not treated promptly.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a history of falling from a height of 10 feet while working on a construction site. He complains of severe pain in his right leg and is unable to bear weight. On examination, there is an obvious deformity in the midshaft region of the right femur with swelling and tenderness. X-rays show a comminuted fracture of the right femoral shaft with displacement.

Which one of the following management options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Conservative management
B. Intramedullary nailing
C. Plate fixation
D. External fixation
E. Amputation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The treatment for diaphyseal fractures depends on various factors such as age, bone quality, soft tissue condition, and fracture pattern. In young adults, intramedullary nailing is the preferred method due to its advantages over other methods like early mobilization, preservation of blood supply to bone fragments, and lower rates of non-union or malunion.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of left hip pain that has been progressively worsening over the past few months. She reports no significant trauma but does have a history of osteoporosis and falls frequently at home despite using walking aids. On examination, there is limited range of motion in the left hip joint with tenderness over greater trochanteric region.

What imaging modality would be most appropriate for further evaluation? 

A. X-ray pelvis 
B. MRI hip joint 
C. CT scan hip joint 
D. Ultrasound hip joint 
E. Bone scan

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients presenting with chronic hip pain without any clear history of trauma or acute onset symptoms, MRI is considered as the gold standard investigation for detecting occult fractures or soft tissue injuries like labral tears, tendinopathies or bursitis.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a history of being hit by a car while crossing the road. He complains of severe pain in his left leg and is unable to move it. On examination, there is an obvious deformity in the midshaft region of the left tibia with swelling and tenderness. X-rays show a displaced fracture of the left tibial shaft with extensive comminution.

Which one of the following management options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Conservative management
B. Intramedullary nailing
C. Plate fixation
D. External fixation 
E. Amputation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In cases where there is extensive soft tissue damage or contamination like open fractures, external fixation is preferred over other methods as it allows early mobilization and wound care without disturbing the healing process or causing further damage to surrounding tissues. It also provides stability to bone fragments and helps in maintaining alignment during healing.

Question
A 45-year-old marathon runner presents to the clinic with complaints of pain and swelling in his right ankle that has been worsening over the past few weeks. He reports no history of trauma or injury to the area. On examination, there is tenderness on palpation over the lateral malleolus, and an MRI scan reveals a partial tear of the peroneal tendon. The patient is advised to undergo conservative management initially, but after six weeks, he continues to experience persistent pain and difficulty with ambulation.

Which one of the following options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Surgical repair
B. Immobilization in a cast
C. Physical therapy
D. Platelet-rich plasma injection 
E. Corticosteroid injection

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Conservative treatment may be sufficient for some patients with peroneal tendon injuries; however, surgical intervention may be necessary if symptoms persist despite non-operative measures or if there is complete rupture of the tendon.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe pain and swelling in his left leg after falling from a ladder while cleaning gutters at home earlier that day. On examination, there is significant bruising and edema over his calf muscle, which feels tense and firm on palpation. There are no signs of neurovascular compromise distally.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Deep vein thrombosis
B. Ruptured Achilles tendon
C. Compartment syndrome 
D. Hamstring strain 
E. Tibial plateau fracture

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation described suggests acute compartment syndrome due to increased pressure within a closed fascial space leading to ischemia and tissue necrosis if not treated promptly.

Question

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with a history of gradual loss of central vision in his left eye over the past year. He reports difficulty reading and recognizing faces, and has noticed distortion in straight lines. On examination, visual acuity is 6/9 in the right eye and 6/60 in the left eye. Fundoscopy reveals drusen deposits and pigmentary changes in both maculae, with subretinal fluid and haemorrhages present only in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography confirms choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the left eye.
Which one of the following treatments would be most appropriate for this patient? 
A. Photodynamic therapy
B. Intravitreal dexamethasone implant
C. Laser photocoagulation
D. Oral prednisolone
E. Observation

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features suggest wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which can be treated with intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents or photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves administration of verteporfin followed by laser activation to selectively occlude CNV vessels while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents with sudden onset painless loss of vision in her right eye that began two days ago upon waking up from sleep. She denies any recent trauma or infection but mentions having hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which she takes medications regularly.
On examination, visual acuity is hand movements close to face on the affected side and 6/9 on the unaffected side. Fundoscopy reveals a pale optic disc with a cherry red spot at its center surrounded by retinal whitening extending into all four quadrants.
What is the MOST LIKELY diagnosis? 
A. Central retinal vein occlusion
B. Central retinal artery occlusion
C. Branch retinal vein occlusion
D. Branch retinal artery occlusion
E. Ischemic optic neuropathy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical features suggest central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), which is a medical emergency that requires immediate evaluation and treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss. Risk factors for CRAO include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with a history of progressive bilateral visual loss over the past year, worse in dim light conditions. He reports difficulty navigating in unfamiliar places and frequently bumping into objects at night.
On examination, visual acuity is 6/9 in both eyes but there is marked constriction of the visual fields bilaterally on confrontation testing. Fundoscopy reveals bone spicule pigmentation around the mid-periphery of both retinae with attenuated vessels and waxy pallor of the optic discs.
What is the MOST LIKELY diagnosis? 
A. Age-related macular degeneration
B. Glaucoma
C. Retinitis pigmentosa
D. Diabetic retinopathy
E. Macular telangiectasia type 2

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical features suggest retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of rod photoreceptor cells leading to night blindness followed by tunnel vision and eventually central vision loss as cone cells are affected later in the disease course. Bone spicule pigmentation, vessel attenuation, and optic disc pallor are typical findings on fundoscopy in RP patients.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with chronic diarrhoea, steatorrhoea and weight loss over the past year. She reports no abdominal pain or vomiting but has noticed an increase in flatulence. Her medical history is significant for a previous diagnosis of Crohn's disease which was treated with surgery several years ago. Physical examination reveals mild pallor and diffuse abdominal tenderness without any palpable masses or organomegaly.

Investigations reveal:

Haemoglobin: 10 g/dL (normal range: 12-16)
Serum albumin: 2.8 g/dL (normal range: 3.5-5)
Stool microscopy: positive for fat globules
Small bowel biopsy: villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia

Which one of the following is the most likely cause of her malabsorption? 

A. Whipple's disease 
B. Tropical sprue 
C. Short bowel syndrome 
D. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome 
E. Autoimmune enteropathy 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests malabsorption due to small intestinal pathology, possibly related to her previous history of Crohn's disease. However, the presence of steatorrhoea and villous atrophy on small bowel biopsy suggest a specific underlying cause such as Whipple's disease, which is caused by infection with Tropheryma whipplei bacteria and can lead to severe malabsorption if left untreated.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents with recurrent episodes of bloating, abdominal cramps and watery diarrhoea over the past six months that have been interfering with his work schedule and social life. He denies any recent travel or sick contacts but admits to consuming large amounts of raw vegetables and fruits as part of his vegan diet regimen.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Coeliac disease 
B. Giardiasis 
C. Lactose intolerance 
D. Whipple's disease 
E. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests malabsorption due to small intestinal pathology, possibly related to his vegan diet which may be high in fermentable carbohydrates that can promote bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine leading to symptoms such as bloating, cramps and diarrhoea. The low serum vitamin B12 level may also suggest impaired absorption due to SIBO.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with chronic diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue over the past year despite multiple courses of antibiotics and probiotics prescribed by her GP for suspected gastroenteritis or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). She reports no significant medical history but admits to consuming large amounts of alcohol on a daily basis.

Physical examination reveals mild pallor and diffuse abdominal tenderness without any palpable masses or organomegaly. Laboratory investigations reveal:

Haemoglobin: 9 g/dL (normal range: 12-16)
Serum albumin: 2 g/dL (normal range: 3.5-5)
Stool microscopy: negative for ova and parasites
Small bowel biopsy: villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes

Which one of the following is the most likely cause of her malabsorption? 

A. Crohn's disease 
B. Autoimmune enteropathy 
C. Tropical sprue 
D. Alcohol-related enteropathy 
E. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to various gastrointestinal complications including malabsorption due to enteropathy, which is characterized by villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes on small bowel biopsy. The clinical presentation of this patient with chronic diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue along with laboratory findings of anaemia and hypoalbuminemia suggest a diagnosis of alcohol-related enteropathy.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the clinic with complaints of fever, headache and joint pain for the past week. She recently returned from a trip to Nigeria where she did not take any prophylactic medications for malaria. On examination, her temperature is 39Â°C, pulse rate is 110 beats per minute and blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. Blood tests reveal thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. Thick and thin blood smears show ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum in red blood cells.
Which of the following antimalarial drugs would be most appropriate for treatment? 

A. Chloroquine
B. Mefloquine
C. Quinine
D. Atovaquone-proguanil
E. Artemether-lumefantrine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient has severe P.falciparum malaria which requires intravenous quinine as first-line therapy according to WHO guidelines.

Question
A 30-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of fever, chills and sweating over the past few months despite taking prophylactic medication during his recent visit to Ghana. He reports that he completed a full course of atovaquone-proguanil while there but missed some doses due to forgetfulness. On examination, he appears well with no significant findings except mild splenomegaly on palpation.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Recurrent vivax malaria
B. Recrudescent falciparum malaria 
C. Mixed infection with multiple species of Plasmodium 
D. Drug-resistant malaria 
E. Chronic brucellosis 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest recrudescence or relapse of P.falciparum malaria despite adequate prophylaxis due to incomplete adherence to medication.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents with a history of fever, headache and myalgia for the past week. She recently returned from a trip to Uganda where she took prophylactic medication as prescribed. On examination, her temperature is 38Â°C, pulse rate is 90 beats per minute and blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg. Blood tests reveal thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. Thick and thin blood smears show ring forms of Plasmodium ovale in red blood cells.
Which of the following statements about P.ovale malaria is true? 

A. It is associated with the highest risk of severe disease among all species of Plasmodium 
B. It has a shorter incubation period than other species of Plasmodium
C. It can cause relapses months or years after initial infection due to hypnozoites in the liver
D. It is transmitted exclusively by Anopheles mosquitoes 
E. Chloroquine resistance has been reported in most endemic areas

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: P.ovale malaria can cause relapses due to dormant hypnozoites in the liver which can reactivate months or even years later, making it important to treat with primaquine to prevent relapse.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his dermatologist with a pigmented lesion on his leg that has been gradually increasing in size over the past year. The lesion is asymmetrical, has an irregular border, and consists of multiple shades of pigment. On examination, there is no palpable lymphadenopathy or evidence of distant metastasis. A biopsy taken confirms malignant melanoma with an invasive depth of 3mm and a high mitotic rate. The patient undergoes wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy which reveals micrometastases in one lymph node.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient?

A. Observation
B. Adjuvant radiotherapy
C. Adjuvant chemotherapy
D. Immunotherapy
E. Palliative care

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's melanoma has a poor prognosis due to its depth and high mitotic rate, as well as the presence of micrometastases in one lymph node. Therefore, adjuvant therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve survival outcomes. Immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies, have shown promising results in treating advanced melanoma and are now being used in the adjuvant setting.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a pigmented lesion on her arm that she noticed several months ago but did not seek medical attention until now because it has started to itch and bleed intermittently. On examination, there is a 10mm diameter asymmetrically shaped lesion with variegated colouration and an irregular border consistent with malignant melanoma.

What is the next step in management?

A. Excisional biopsy
B. Shave biopsy
C. Punch biopsy
D. Incisional biopsy
E. No biopsy needed

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Suspicious pigmented lesions should be biopsied by excisional biopsy, which involves removing the entire lesion along with a margin of normal skin. This allows for accurate diagnosis and staging of melanoma, as well as complete removal if it is confirmed to be malignant. Shave or punch biopsies are not recommended due to the risk of incomplete sampling and inaccurate diagnosis.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to his GP with a pigmented lesion on his back that has been present for several years but has recently started to change in size and shape. On examination, there is an irregularly shaped lesion with variegated colouration and an asymmetrical border measuring 8mm in diameter. The patient has fair skin and a history of sunburns during childhood.

What is the most important modifiable risk factor for this patient?

A. Family history
B. Age
C. Gender
D. Sun exposure
E. Immunosuppression

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Sun exposure is the most important modifiable risk factor for developing melanoma, particularly in individuals with fair skin who burn easily and have a history of severe sunburns during childhood or adolescence. Other risk factors include family history, age over 50 years old, male gender, immunosuppression, and presence of numerous atypical moles (dysplastic nevi).

Question
A 68-year-old man with a history of alcoholism and chronic pancreatitis presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On examination, he appears malnourished, with muscle wasting and dry skin. His laboratory results show low serum albumin levels and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal pancreatic calcifications and evidence of cirrhosis. Which nutritional intervention is most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube
B. Parenteral nutrition via central venous catheter 
C. Oral supplements enriched in medium-chain triglycerides 
D. High-protein diet supplemented with branched-chain amino acids 
E. Low-fat diet supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation suggests acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis complicated by cirrhosis and possible hepatic encephalopathy, which may impair his ability to tolerate enteral feeding or oral supplements. Therefore, parenteral nutrition may be necessary to provide adequate nutrients while minimizing the risk of further complications.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of fatigue, weakness, hair loss, and brittle nails over the past few months. She reports a history of gastric bypass surgery 2 years ago for obesity but has not followed up regularly with her bariatric team since then. On examination, she appears pale and thin, with diffuse alopecia and koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails). Laboratory tests reveal microcytic anemia and low ferritin levels despite iron supplementation. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? 

A. Iron deficiency due to malabsorption after gastric bypass surgery
B. Vitamin B12 deficiency due to intrinsic factor deficiency
C. Folate deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake 
D. Zinc deficiency due to impaired absorption from the bypassed intestine 
E. Copper deficiency due to reduced intake and absorption from food 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Gastric bypass surgery can lead to malabsorption of iron, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, zinc, and copper due to bypassing or removing parts of the stomach and small intestine that are involved in nutrient absorption. Iron deficiency is a common complication that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, hair loss, and brittle nails. Supplementation with oral or intravenous iron may be necessary to correct the deficiency.

Question
A 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis presents to his nephrologist for routine follow-up. He reports poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss over the past few weeks despite compliance with his dialysis regimen. On examination, he appears cachectic and dehydrated, with dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor. His laboratory results show low serum albumin levels and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. What is the most appropriate intervention for this patient? 

A. Increase protein intake to improve nutritional status
B. Decrease fluid intake to prevent fluid overload
C. Initiate enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube 
D. Administer antiemetic medication for symptomatic relief 
E. Adjust dialysis prescription to optimize clearance of uremic toxins 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Malnutrition is a common complication of end-stage renal disease due to dietary restrictions, metabolic abnormalities, inflammation, and catabolism associated with chronic kidney failure. In this patient's case, his symptoms suggest inadequate dialysis clearance leading to accumulation of uremic toxins that impair appetite and cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, adjusting his dialysis prescription may be necessary to improve his nutritional status by reducing toxin load and restoring electrolyte balance while avoiding complications such as hypotension or arrhythmia.

Question
A 6-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a high fever, cough, and rash that started on his face and has now spread to his trunk and extremities. On examination, he has bilateral conjunctivitis, Koplik spots on his buccal mucosa, and a maculopapular rash that is confluent on his face but discrete on his trunk. His parents report that he was not vaccinated against measles due to personal beliefs. Which of the following complications is this patient at risk for? 

A. Acute otitis media
B. Encephalitis 
C. Hemolytic uremic syndrome 
D. Myocarditis 
E. Thrombocytopenia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Measles can cause several complications including pneumonia, bronchitis, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), acute otitis media, encephalitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), myocarditis and pericarditis.

Question
A 25-year-old woman who works in a hospital presents with a rash that began behind her ears and then spread down her body over the last few days along with other symptoms such as coughing and sneezing. She reports being vaccinated against measles during childhood but does not have any records or documentation of it.
Which of the following tests would be most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis? 

A. Serological testing for IgM antibodies against measles virus
B. Chest X-ray 
C. PCR testing for viral RNA in blood 
D. Skin biopsy 
E. Urine culture 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The diagnosis of measles can be confirmed by serological testing for IgM antibodies against measles virus. Chest X-ray may be useful in detecting complications such as pneumonia, but it is not used for diagnosis. PCR testing can also be used to detect viral RNA in blood or urine samples, but serological testing is the preferred method. Skin biopsy and urine culture are not indicated for the diagnosis of measles.

Question
A 2-year-old girl presents with a high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis and a maculopapular rash that started on her face and has now spread to her trunk and extremities over the last few days. She was vaccinated against measles at 12 months of age according to her parents' records.
Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this presentation? 

A. Primary vaccine failure 
B. Secondary vaccine failure 
C. Reinfection with wild-type measles virus
D. Atypical measles syndrome 
E. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine strain infection

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Secondary vaccine failure occurs when an individual who initially responded to vaccination loses immunity over time due to waning antibody levels or other factors such as immunosuppression or interference from maternal antibodies. Primary vaccine failure occurs when an individual fails to develop adequate immunity after vaccination, which can occur due to various reasons such as improper storage or administration of the vaccine or underlying immunodeficiency disorders. Reinfection with wild-type measles virus is possible but unlikely in a vaccinated individual with documented evidence of prior vaccination. Atypical measles syndrome is a rare complication that can occur in individuals who were previously exposed to wild-type measles virus before receiving the live attenuated vaccine, but it is not relevant in this case since the patient received MMR vaccine according to her parents' records.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in his left ear. He reports a history of recurrent episodes of dizziness over the past few months but never experienced these symptoms before. The patient denies any recent upper respiratory tract infections or head trauma.

On examination, he has horizontal nystagmus that is more pronounced when looking towards the left side. Pure-tone audiometry reveals a low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Meniere's disease
B. Labyrinthitis ossificans
C. Superior canal dehiscence syndrome
D. Ototoxicity
E. Acoustic neuroma

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with Meniere's disease, which is characterized by episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss typically affecting one ear only. Horizontal nystagmus may be present during an acute attack, and pure-tone audiometry often shows a low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss on the affected side.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of recurrent episodes of vertigo lasting for several hours accompanied by nausea and vomiting over the past year. She also reports experiencing ringing in her ears and feeling like her hearing is muffled during these attacks.

On examination, she has normal otoscopy findings bilaterally, and Weber's test lateralizes to the right ear while Rinne's test is positive (air conduction louder than bone conduction) in both ears.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Vestibular migraine
B. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)
C. Meniere's disease
D. Vestibular schwannoma
E. Cerebellar infarction

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with Meniere's disease, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo lasting for several hours accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Tinnitus and hearing loss may also be present during these attacks. Weber's test lateralizing to the right ear suggests a possible sensorineural hearing loss on that side.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of sudden onset of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in his left ear over the past few days. He reports no history of head trauma or recent upper respiratory tract infections.

On examination, he has horizontal nystagmus that is more pronounced when looking towards the left side. Pure-tone audiometry reveals a low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Labyrinthitis ossificans
B. Ototoxicity
C. Acoustic neuroma
D. Meniere's disease
E. Superior canal dehiscence syndrome

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with Meniere's disease, which is characterized by episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss typically affecting one ear only. Horizontal nystagmus may be present during an acute attack, and pure-tone audiometry often shows a low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss on the affected side. Head trauma or upper respiratory tract infections are common triggers for an acute attack but not always necessary for its development.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a severe headache, photophobia, and neck stiffness. He reports feeling unwell for the past week with fever and malaise. On examination, he has a temperature of 39Â°C and is tachycardic. There are no focal neurological deficits. Blood tests show elevated inflammatory markers.

A lumbar puncture is performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows an opening pressure of 25 cm H2O, protein level of 1.5 g/L (normal range: <0.45g/L), glucose level of 2 mmol/L (normal range: 2.5-4.4 mmol/L), white blood cell count of 500 cells/mm3 (90% neutrophils). Gram stain shows gram-negative diplococci.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Viral meningitis caused by enterovirus
C. Fungal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans
D. Tuberculous meningitis 
E. Chronic meningitis due to syphilis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and recent travel history suggest possible exposure to fungal pathogens that can cause meningitis such as Cryptococcus neoformans which is commonly found in soil contaminated with bird droppings especially in sub-Saharan Africa.The diagnosis can be confirmed through CSF analysis which typically shows high opening pressure, elevated protein levels and low glucose levels along with evidence of cryptococcal antigen on culture or serological testing .Treatment involves induction therapy with amphotericin B plus flucytosine followed by consolidation therapy with fluconazole.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of hot flushes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness for the past year. She has a history of hypertension and is currently on medication for it. On examination, her blood pressure is within normal limits, but she has atrophic changes in the vulva and vagina. What is the most appropriate treatment option? Should you recommend hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or non-hormonal treatments? Discuss the benefits and risks associated with each treatment option.

A. HRT
B. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
C. Clonidine
D. Gabapentin
E. Black cohosh

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's medical history of hypertension may make HRT contraindicated due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with its use in this population. Non-hormonal options such as SSRIs can be considered to manage vasomotor symptoms in women who cannot take or do not want to take HRT.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with postmenopausal bleeding that started three months ago after being amenorrhoeic for five years following natural menopause at age 52 years old. Her last cervical smear was six years ago, which was reported as negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy (NILM). Pelvic ultrasound reveals endometrial thickness of 12 mm, which raises suspicion for endometrial cancer despite no other concerning findings on imaging studies or physical exam.
What are the next steps? How would you investigate further? What management options should be discussed?

A. Endometrial biopsy
B. Dilatation and curettage (D&C)
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

E. Observation only

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Endometrial biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometrial cancer in women with postmenopausal bleeding. Further management options will depend on the results of this investigation.

Question
A 48-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of irregular periods, hot flushes, and night sweats that have been ongoing for six months. She has a history of breast cancer diagnosed two years ago and underwent mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Her last mammogram was reported as normal three months ago.
What are the treatment options? What factors should be considered when deciding on appropriate therapy? How would you manage potential interactions between hormonal treatments and previous breast cancer diagnosis?

A. HRT
B. Non-hormonal treatments
C. Tamoxifen
D. Aromatase inhibitors
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Women with a history of breast cancer may not be candidates for HRT due to an increased risk of recurrence associated with its use in this population. Other non-hormonal options can be considered to manage vasomotor symptoms in these patients, but careful consideration must be given to potential drug-drug interactions and their impact on disease outcomes. In some cases, observation alone may be the most appropriate option if benefits do not outweigh risks or if other medical conditions preclude certain therapies.

What is the most appropriate course of action? 

A. Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
B. Perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
C. Initiate intravenous unfractionated heparin
D. Restart warfarin immediately
E. Switch to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In this case, it is likely that the patient's DVT prophylaxis was insufficient during the period when she stopped taking warfarin but continued LMWH use leading up to surgery, which may have contributed to her MI due to inadequate anti-coagulation coverage. Intravenous unfractionated heparin should be initiated as soon as possible since it has rapid onset and can provide immediate anti-coagulation effects while awaiting further interventions such as PCI or tPA if necessary.

Question
A 60-year-old male patient presents with recurrent episodes of epistaxis over several months despite conservative management measures including nasal packing and cautery procedures by an otolaryngologist.

The patient reports no significant medical history except for hypertension controlled with amlodipine. Laboratory investigations show normal platelet count, but prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Mixing studies reveal that the patient's plasma corrects to normal when mixed with control plasma.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Von Willebrand disease
B. Hemophilia A
C. Factor V Leiden mutation
D. Lupus anticoagulant (LA)
E. Protein C deficiency

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation of recurrent epistaxis in combination with isolated prolongation of PT and aPTT suggests an underlying coagulation disorder such as LA, which can interfere with phospholipid-dependent clotting assays resulting in falsely prolonged test results. Additional testing for LA should be performed to confirm the diagnosis before considering treatment options.

Question
A 45-year-old female patient presents to the emergency department after experiencing sudden onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at work earlier that day.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been taking warfarin therapy for several years with stable INR levels between 2-3. On examination, she has left hemiparesis and facial droop consistent with acute ischemic stroke.

What is the most appropriate course of action? 

A. Administer intravenous alteplase within 4 hours of symptom onset
B. Perform emergent carotid endarterectomy 
C. Initiate intravenous unfractionated heparin 
D. Restart warfarin immediately 
E. Switch to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In this case, the patient meets criteria for administration of intravenous alteplase within 4 hours of symptom onset since she has no contraindications such as recent surgery or bleeding disorders, and her INR is within therapeutic range. The other options such as emergent carotid endarterectomy or anti-coagulation therapy with heparin or warfarin are not appropriate for acute ischemic stroke management and may even increase the risk of bleeding complications.

Question
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction is admitted to the hospital with chest pain. He is diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. He is started on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel. After one year of DAPT, he presents to his cardiologist for follow-up. His blood pressure is well-controlled at 130/80 mmHg, fasting glucose is 6.2 mmol/l, and fasting cholesterol is 3.5 mmol/l.

Which of the following options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Continue DAPT indefinitely
B. Discontinue clopidogrel and continue aspirin alone
C. Switch from clopidogrel to prasugrel
D. Add ticagrelor to current DAPT regimen 
E. Stop all antiplatelet therapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Current guidelines recommend that patients who have undergone PCI should receive DAPT for at least 12 months after stent placement unless there are contraindications or bleeding risks present. After one year, continuation of single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with aspirin alone may be considered in low-risk patients without prior bleeding events or other indications for prolonged DAPT.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of recurrent headaches over the past few weeks along with mild dizziness and tinnitus in her left ear. She has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia for which she takes multiple medications including aspirin as part of secondary prevention after a previous stroke two years ago.

What would be the most appropriate next step? 

A. Increase dose of aspirin 
B. Discontinue aspirin and start clopidogrel 
C. Refer for urgent neuroimaging 
D. Start antihypertensive medication 
E. Prescribe a benzodiazepine for symptom relief 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The symptoms described by the patient are concerning for possible intracranial pathology such as an intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage, which can be associated with antiplatelet therapy use. Urgent neuroimaging is necessary to rule out these possibilities before any changes in antiplatelet therapy or other medications are made.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of easy bruising and prolonged bleeding after minor injuries over the past few weeks. He has a history of atrial fibrillation for which he takes warfarin and has been recently started on low-dose aspirin as part of secondary prevention after a previous myocardial infarction.

What would be the most appropriate next step? 

A. Increase dose of warfarin 
B. Discontinue aspirin and monitor INR more closely 
C. Switch from warfarin to dabigatran 
D. Add clopidogrel to current regimen 
E. Stop all antithrombotic therapy 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Combination therapy with warfarin and antiplatelet agents increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially in older patients who may have age-related declines in renal function or other comorbidities that increase bleeding risk. In this case, discontinuing aspirin and monitoring international normalized ratio (INR) levels more closely may help reduce bleeding risk while still maintaining adequate anticoagulation control for atrial fibrillation management.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain and a high-grade fever. She reports having unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the past few weeks. On examination, she has cervical motion tenderness and bilateral adnexal tenderness on bimanual pelvic examination. Her laboratory investigations show an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. An ultrasound scan shows complex fluid collections in the pelvis, suggestive of tubo-ovarian abscesses.
What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Intravenous antibiotics alone
B. Surgical drainage of abscesses only
C. Intravenous antibiotics followed by surgical drainage if necessary
D. Oral antibiotics alone
E. Observation without any intervention

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease complicated by tubo-ovarian abscesses, which require prompt treatment to prevent further complications such as sepsis or infertility. The recommended management includes intravenous antibiotics followed by surgical drainage if necessary.

Question
A 24-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of chronic pelvic pain that has been ongoing for several months, associated with dyspareunia and abnormal vaginal discharge. She has no significant medical history but reports having unprotected sexual intercourse with a new partner recently. On examination, there is mild cervical motion tenderness and no other abnormalities are noted.
Which one of the following tests would be most useful in establishing the diagnosis? 

A. Endometrial biopsy 
B. Transvaginal ultrasound 
C. Urine culture 
D. Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) 
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical features described suggest possible pelvic inflammatory disease caused by sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea. The most appropriate test to establish the diagnosis is a chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which has high sensitivity and specificity.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents with acute onset of severe lower abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. She reports having unprotected sexual intercourse with her partner two weeks ago. On examination, there is marked tenderness in the right iliac fossa with rebound tenderness and guarding. Laboratory investigations show an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Appendicitis
B. Ectopic pregnancy
C. Ovarian torsion
D. Pelvic inflammatory disease 
E. Renal colic

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause significant morbidity if not treated promptly. The clinical features described suggest involvement of the right fallopian tube or ovary, leading to inflammation and abscess formation in the pelvis. Other differential diagnoses such as appendicitis or ectopic pregnancy should also be considered but are less likely based on this presentation.

Question
A 60-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and melena for the past 24 hours. He has a history of peptic ulcer disease and is on long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy. On examination, he appears pale and tachycardic. Blood tests reveal low haemoglobin levels and elevated serum amylase levels. An urgent upper GI endoscopy is performed which reveals multiple gastric ulcers with active bleeding.

Which one of the following is most likely responsible for this presentation? 

A. Helicobacter pylori infection
B. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use 
C. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
D. Stress-induced mucosal damage 
E. Gastric adenocarcinoma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease, which can be caused by various factors including H.pylori infection, NSAIDs use, stress-induced mucosal damage or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. However, given the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and long-term PPI therapy, NSAID use is the most likely cause of his current presentation.

Question
A 35-year-old female patient presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of epigastric pain that are relieved by food intake but worsen after meals or when lying down at night. She also reports nausea, bloating and early satiety over the past few weeks. Her medical history is unremarkable except for occasional use of non-prescription antacids for mild dyspepsia in the past year.
On examination, she appears well-nourished without any signs of anaemia or jaundice.
What would be an appropriate initial investigation? 

A. Upper GI endoscopy 
B. Abdominal ultrasound 
C. Fecal occult blood test 
D. Serum gastrin level measurement
E. Helicobacter pylori stool antigen test

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, which can be caused by various factors including H.pylori infection, NSAIDs use or stress-induced mucosal damage. An appropriate initial investigation would be to perform a non-invasive H.pylori stool antigen test, which has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting active infection.

Question
A 55-year-old male patient presents with recurrent episodes of epigastric pain that are relieved by food intake but worsen after meals or when lying down at night. He also reports nausea, vomiting and weight loss over the past few months. His medical history is significant for chronic alcohol abuse and smoking.
On examination, he appears malnourished with signs of anaemia and jaundice.
What would be an appropriate next step? 

A. Upper GI endoscopy 
B. Abdominal CT scan 
C. Liver function tests 
D. Serum gastrin level measurement
E. Colonoscopy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of advanced peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancer, which require further evaluation with upper GI endoscopy to assess the extent of mucosal damage and obtain biopsy samples for histological analysis. Other investigations such as liver function tests may be useful in ruling out other causes of jaundice, while colonoscopy is not indicated in this clinical scenario.

Question
A 38-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease presents to the clinic with recurrent perianal abscesses and fistulae. He has undergone multiple surgical procedures in the past for drainage of these abscesses but they keep recurring. On examination, there are multiple discharging orifices around his anus.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? Should he undergo another surgery? If so, what type? Or should he be started on medical therapy? What would be the best choice of medication?

A. Repeat surgical drainage
B. Placement of seton
C. Fistulotomy
D. Infliximab therapy
E. Adalimumab therapy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In this patient with recurrent perianal abscesses and fistulae, medical therapy with biologics such as infliximab or adalimumab may be considered before resorting to further surgeries which can lead to complications like fecal incontinence and impaired wound healing. Adalimumab is preferred over infliximab due to its better efficacy in treating perianal fistulae.

Question
A 27-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with pain and swelling around her anus that has been present for several days now. She reports difficulty sitting down and discomfort during bowel movements.

On examination, there is a tender lump felt near her anal opening that appears red and inflamed.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What other conditions should be considered? What would be the initial management plan?

A. Perianal abscess; consider pilonidal sinus; incision and drainage
B. Pilonidal sinus; consider Bartholin cyst; antibiotics
C. Anal fissure; consider hemorrhoids; topical glyceryl trinitrate
D. Hemorrhoids; consider anal cancer; excision
E. Anal cancer; consider anal fissure; biopsy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a perianal abscess. Other conditions that can present similarly include pilonidal sinus, Bartholin cyst, anal fissure, and hemorrhoids. Initial management would involve incision and drainage of the abscess along with antibiotics.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department (ED) with severe pain around his anus for the past few days. He reports difficulty passing stools due to the pain.

On examination, there is a large tender swelling felt near his anal opening that appears red and inflamed.

What investigations should be ordered? What is the most likely diagnosis? What would be the definitive treatment?

A. CT pelvis; perianal abscess; antibiotics
B. Endo-anal ultrasound; pilonidal sinus; excision
C. MRI pelvis; perianal fistulae; seton placement
D. Rigid sigmoidoscopy; rectal prolapse; surgery
E. Barium enema; colon cancer; resection

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In this patient presenting with severe pain around the anus and a large tender swelling on examination, perianal fistulae should be suspected as they can cause recurrent abscesses and chronic discharge from multiple orifices in the perineum. An MRI pelvis is considered the gold standard investigation for diagnosing these fistulae which may require surgical intervention such as seton placement for definitive treatment.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath that started suddenly while he was at rest.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents with a history of amenorrhea, galactorrhea and visual disturbances for the past six months. On examination, she has bilateral gynaecomastia and bitemporal hemianopia. Blood tests reveal elevated prolactin levels (1200 mIU/L) and low levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). An MRI shows a large pituitary tumour that is compressing the optic chiasm.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Craniopharyngioma
B. Prolactinoma
C. Acromegaly
D. Cushing's disease 
E. Non-functioning pituitary adenoma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests hyperprolactinaemia due to a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma or prolactinoma, which can cause amenorrhea, galactorrhea, visual disturbances and hypogonadism in both sexes. Elevated serum prolactin levels confirm the diagnosis of prolactinoma while an MRI will show a sellar mass that may be invasive or non-invasive.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents with symptoms suggestive of acromegaly including enlarged hands and feet, coarse facial features, sweating and fatigue for several years. His blood pressure is elevated at 170/100 mmHg but he has no other significant medical history apart from hypertension controlled on medication.
Blood tests reveal high insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and failure to suppress growth hormone (GH) after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). An MRI demonstrates a large sellar mass extending into the suprasellar region.

What is the next best step in management? 

A. Trans-sphenoidal surgery
B. Medical therapy with somatostatin analogues
C. Radiotherapy 
D. Dopamine agonist therapy
E. Observation and follow-up

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features of this patient suggest acromegaly due to a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma, which can cause enlargement of hands and feet, coarse facial features, sweating and fatigue. Elevated serum IGF-1 levels confirm the diagnosis while failure to suppress GH after OGTT indicates excess GH secretion. Trans-sphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment for macroadenomas causing mass effect or visual field defects.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents with a history of weight gain, hirsutism, acne and irregular menstrual periods for several years. On examination, she has central obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump and striae on her abdomen.
Blood tests reveal elevated cortisol levels that fail to suppress after overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ODST). An MRI demonstrates a sellar mass that is invading the cavernous sinus.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cushing's disease 
B. Adrenal carcinoma
C. Primary hyperaldosteronism
D. Pheochromocytoma
E. Non-functioning pituitary adenoma

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests Cushing's syndrome caused by ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma or Cushing's disease which can cause weight gain, hirsutism, acne and menstrual abnormalities in women along with other signs such as central obesity, moon facies and buffalo hump due to excess cortisol production from adrenal glands stimulated by ACTH secretion from the tumour cells in the pituitary gland. ODST confirms the diagnosis while an MRI shows a sellar mass that may be invasive or non-invasive.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 32 weeks gestation with a history of recurrent vaginal bleeding and previous caesarean section for placenta praevia. On examination, her cervix is closed, but there is evidence of an anterior low-lying placenta extending up to the internal os. The patient has been counselled about the risks associated with this condition.

What are the potential complications that can occur in this patient? 

A. Preterm labour
B. Placental abruption
C. Fetal growth restriction
D. Uterine rupture 
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Patients with a history of placenta praevia have an increased risk of preterm labour, fetal growth restriction, and placental abruption due to abnormal placentation and uterine scarring from previous caesarean sections or other uterine surgeries. Additionally, they are at risk for uterine rupture during delivery due to thinning of the lower segment of the uterus where the placenta is implanted.

Question
A 28-year-old primigravida presents at 36 weeks gestation with painless vaginal bleeding since last night. She denies any abdominal pain or contractions and reports good fetal movements.

On examination, she appears comfortable with stable vital signs and no signs of active bleeding per vaginum. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender on palpation with cephalic presentation noted on ultrasound scan.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Placenta accreta 
B. Placenta previa 
C. Abruptio placentae 
D. Vasa previa 
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Painless vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy should raise suspicion for placenta previa until proven otherwise by ultrasound imaging. Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta implants in the lower uterine segment and partially or completely covers the internal os, leading to painless vaginal bleeding as the cervix dilates during labour.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents at 34 weeks gestation with recurrent episodes of heavy vaginal bleeding over the past week. She has no significant medical history and denies any abdominal pain or contractions.

On examination, her vital signs are stable with mild pallor noted on conjunctival examination. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender on palpation with cephalic presentation noted on ultrasound scan. There is evidence of an anterior low-lying placenta extending up to the internal os.

A 45-year-old woman presents with progressive dyspnoea on exertion, fatigue and chest pain for the past six months. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension three years ago. Her medications include sildenafil, warfarin, prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine.

On examination, her oxygen saturation is 92% on room air; respiratory rate is 20/min; there are bilateral basal crepitations; jugular venous pressure is elevated at 8 cm above the sternal angle; and there is a loud P2 heart sound.

Which of the following investigations would be most useful in determining the severity of her pulmonary hypertension? 

A. Echocardiogram
B. Pulmonary function tests
C. Chest X-ray
D. CT scan of the chest
E. Right heart catheterisation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The gold standard investigation to diagnose and determine the severity of pulmonary hypertension is right heart catheterisation (RHC). It measures mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac output (CO) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). In this patient with SLE-associated pulmonary hypertension, RHC can help guide management decisions such as initiation or escalation of targeted therapy.

Question
A 56-year-old man presents with worsening shortness of breath over the past year along with peripheral oedema, palpitations and chest discomfort on exertion. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which he uses salbutamol inhaler as needed.

On examination, his blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg; pulse rate is regular at 110/min; respiratory rate is 24/min; there are bibasal crackles in his lungs; jugular venous pressure is elevated at 10 cm above the sternal angle; and there is a loud P2 heart sound.

Which of the following investigations would be most useful in determining the cause of his pulmonary hypertension? 

A. Echocardiogram
B. Pulmonary function tests
C. Chest X-ray
D. CT scan of the chest
E. Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: An echocardiogram can help determine the underlying cause of pulmonary hypertension by assessing for right ventricular dysfunction, valvular abnormalities or congenital heart disease. In this patient with COPD, an echocardiogram can also rule out chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which may require specific treatment such as surgical thromboendarterectomy or balloon pulmonary angioplasty.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with progressive dyspnoea on exertion, fatigue and syncope over the past year. She has no significant medical history and takes no medications.

On examination, her oxygen saturation is 95% on room air; respiratory rate is 18/min; there are no abnormal lung sounds; jugular venous pressure is normal; and there is a loud P2 heart sound.

Which of the following investigations would be most useful in diagnosing her condition? 

A. Echocardiogram
B. Pulmonary function tests
C. Chest X-ray
D. CT scan of the chest
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: An echocardiogram can diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by demonstrating increased right ventricular systolic pressure (>40 mmHg), dilated right atrium and/or ventricle, decreased left ventricular size and function, and absence of significant valvular or congenital heart disease. In this young patient with no significant medical history, PAH should be considered as a potential diagnosis and further workup including right heart catheterisation may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Question
A 2-week-old male infant is brought to the emergency department by his parents with a history of projectile vomiting after feeds that has gradually increased in frequency and force over the past few days. On examination, he appears dehydrated with sunken fontanelles, dry mucous membranes, and decreased skin turgor. His blood pressure is 70/40 mmHg, heart rate is 170 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 50 breaths per minute, and temperature is normal. Abdominal examination reveals an olive-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant. An ultrasound confirms a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis.
Which one of the following electrolyte abnormalities would be most likely present in this patient? 

A. Hypernatremia
B. Hyponatremia
C. Hypokalemia
D. Hyperkalemia
E. Hypocalcemia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Pyloric stenosis can lead to hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to loss of hydrochloric acid from the stomach through vomiting leading to renal compensation for acid-base balance which results in potassium wasting.

Question
A 3-month-old female infant presents with a history of non-bilious vomiting after feeding since birth which has progressively worsened over time and now occurs after every feed along with poor weight gain despite adequate caloric intake.
On examination, she appears well-nourished but dehydrated with dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor. Her abdomen is soft without any palpable masses or organomegaly.
What other clinical features should you look for to rule out pyloric stenosis? 

A. Presence of jaundice 
B. Absence of bowel sounds 
C. Distended bladder on abdominal palpation 
D. Visible peristalsis across the abdomen 
E. Palpable mass in the right lower quadrant 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Visible peristalsis across the abdomen is a hallmark of pyloric stenosis. Other features such as projectile vomiting, poor weight gain despite adequate caloric intake, and dehydration are also suggestive.

Question
A 4-week-old male infant presents with non-bilious vomiting after feeds that has gradually increased in frequency and force over the past few days along with decreased urine output and lethargy.
On examination, he appears dehydrated with sunken fontanelles, dry mucous membranes, and decreased skin turgor. His blood pressure is 80/40 mmHg, heart rate is 160 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 50 breaths per minute, and temperature is normal. Abdominal examination reveals an olive-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant. An ultrasound confirms a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis.
What would be your initial management? 

A. Administer intravenous fluids 
B. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics 
C. Perform nasogastric tube insertion 
D. Refer for surgical intervention immediately 
E. Administer antiemetics 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The initial management of pyloric stenosis includes correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances through intravenous fluid administration followed by surgical intervention if necessary. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of infection or sepsis which can occur due to prolonged vomiting leading to aspiration pneumonia or other complications. Nasogastric tube insertion may be considered to decompress the stomach but should not delay definitive treatment. Antiemetics may provide symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying pathology.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a history of progressive pain in his right arm and neck for the past three months. He describes the pain as a burning sensation that radiates down to his fingers, which is aggravated by movement and relieved by rest. On examination, there is tenderness over the cervical spine, reduced range of motion, and positive Spurling's test on the right side.

Explanation: The clinical features of recurrent headaches, pulsatile in nature, associated with nausea and vomiting, and bilateral papilloedema on fundoscopy are suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset severe headache that he describes as "the worst pain of his life". He has no significant medical history but reports taking aspirin daily for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. On examination, he is alert and oriented but appears uncomfortable due to the headache. His blood pressure is elevated, and there is no focal neurological deficit.

A CT scan of the head shows diffuse subarachnoid haemorrhage with no evidence of aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.

Which of the following is not a potential complication associated with this condition? 

A. Vasospasm 
B. Hydrocephalus 
C. Rebleeding 
D. Cerebral oedema 
E. Seizures 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Complications associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage include vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia (option A), hydrocephalus due to obstruction of CSF flow (option B), rebleeding (option C), and seizures (option E). While cerebral oedema can occur in other conditions causing raised intracranial pressure, it is not typically seen in subarachnoid haemorrhage.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the GP with a 2-week history of painful and swollen joints in her hands, wrists, knees, and ankles. She reports having had a recent episode of gastroenteritis following which she developed these symptoms. On examination, there is evidence of synovitis in multiple joints with associated tenderness and swelling. The patient also has conjunctivitis and urethritis.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Rheumatoid arthritis
B. Psoriatic arthritis
C. Reactive arthritis
D. Ankylosing spondylitis
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), which typically follows an infection elsewhere in the body such as gastroenteritis or sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia or gonorrhea. It commonly affects young adults and involves inflammation of multiple joints along with extra-articular manifestations like conjunctivitis, uveitis, balanitis/cervicitis, and skin lesions.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the rheumatology clinic with a 3-month history of recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling involving his knees, ankles, feet, and fingers that last for several days before resolving spontaneously without treatment. He also reports experiencing low-grade fever, fatigue, weight loss, and eye redness during some episodes.

On examination today, there are no active joint signs but he has mild tenderness over his Achilles tendon insertion bilaterally.

Which investigation would be most helpful in confirming the suspected diagnosis? 

A. Synovial fluid analysis 
B. HLA-B27 testing 
C. MRI scan of sacroiliac joints 
D. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies 
E. Serum uric acid levels

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's history is suggestive of undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (SpA), which can present with recurrent episodes of peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and extra-articular features like fever, fatigue, and uveitis. HLA-B27 testing is a useful investigation in such cases as it has a high negative predictive value for SpA (i.e., if the test is negative, SpA is unlikely). However, a positive result does not confirm the diagnosis but increases the likelihood of developing SpA.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe pain and swelling in his right knee that started suddenly while playing football earlier today. He reports no previous history of joint problems or recent infections.

On examination, there is marked effusion in the right knee with associated warmth and tenderness. There are no signs of systemic illness or other joint involvement.

Which feature on further evaluation would suggest an alternative diagnosis? 

A. Positive rheumatoid factor 
B. Elevated serum uric acid levels 
C. Negative anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) 
D. Normal C-reactive protein (CRP) level 
E. Absence of HLA-B27 gene 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute monoarticular arthritis, which can have various causes including infection (septic arthritis), crystal deposition disease (gout or pseudogout), trauma/bleeding into the joint space, or autoimmune/inflammatory conditions like RA or reactive arthritis. The absence of HLA-B27 gene rules out reactive arthritis as a possible cause since this genetic marker is strongly associated with this condition along with other forms of SpA like ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis.

Question
A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe left testicular pain that started five hours ago during his basketball match. The pain radiates to the lower abdomen. He experienced two episodes of vomiting before presenting to the emergency department.

On examination, the left testis is retracted upwards and tender on palpation. The right testis is normal. The cremasteric reflex is absent on the left.

What is the most appropriate step in his management? 

A. Admit for next day bilateral orchidopexy
B. Observe for 4 hours
C. Perform an urgent ultrasound scan of the testes and prescribe IV antibiotics
D. Urgent bilateral orchidopexy
E. Urgent left testicular orchidopexy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Testicular torsion requires immediate surgical intervention as it can lead to ischemia and necrosis of the affected testicle if not treated promptly within a few hours of symptom onset. In this case, since there are no anticipated delays in treatment, urgent surgery should be performed without delay to save the affected testicle from further damage or loss.

Question
A 20-year-old man presents with acute scrotal pain that has been ongoing for several hours after sexual intercourse with his partner last night. On examination, he has tenderness and swelling in both testicles but more pronounced on the right side than on the left side.

Which of these conditions could cause bilateral testicular involvement? 

A) Epididymitis 
B) Orchitis 
C) Testicular torsion 
D) Varicocele 
E) Hydrocele

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Bilateral involvement suggests a systemic infection such as mumps virus causing orchitis rather than a localised event like torsion or epididymitis which typically affects one side only.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe left testicular pain that started two hours ago. The pain radiates to the lower abdomen and he has vomited twice since then. He reports no history of trauma or previous episodes of similar pain.

Explanation: The clinical features described suggest compressive optic neuropathy due to TED which requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent visual loss. Orbital decompression surgery is indicated when there is evidence of optic nerve compression or severe proptosis causing exposure keratopathy or diplopia unresponsive to conservative measures such as high-dose corticosteroids or radiation therapy.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents to his GP with a painless lump in the neck that has been gradually increasing in size over the past year. He has no significant past medical history and is a non-smoker. On examination, there is a 3-cm firm, non-tender nodule on the right side of the anterior triangle of the neck, in the area of the thyroid. Investigations reveal elevated levels of thyroglobulin and calcitonin. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy reveals papillary architecture with some follicles present but also shows areas of necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration.
Which of the following best fits with this patient's diagnosis? 

A. Non-toxic multi-nodular goitre
B. Papillary thyroid carcinoma
C. Medullary thyroid carcinoma
D. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma
E. Follicular thyroid carcinoma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation along with elevated levels of thyroglobulin and calcitonin suggests an aggressive form of thyroid cancer such as anaplastic thyroid carcinoma which is known for its rapid growth, poor prognosis and necrotic features seen on fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to her GP with a palpable mass in her neck that she noticed while applying makeup one morning. She reports no other symptoms or significant past medical history apart from occasional headaches and anxiety attacks for which she takes paracetamol occasionally when needed. On examination, there is a solitary 2 cm nodule on the left lobe of her thyroid gland that moves up on swallowing but does not appear tender or fixed to surrounding structures.
What would be your next step? 

A. Refer for urgent surgical evaluation
B. Repeat ultrasound scan after six months 
C. Order TSH receptor antibodies test 
D. Perform fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)
E. Start the patient on a trial of levothyroxine

Correct Answer: D 

Explanation: The presence of a solitary thyroid nodule warrants further investigation with fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) to determine if it is benign or malignant. This will help guide management and treatment options.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents to his GP with a painless lump in his neck that has been gradually increasing in size over the past year. He reports no other symptoms but has a significant past medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A). On examination, there is a firm, non-tender nodule on the left side of the anterior triangle of the neck, in the area of the thyroid. Investigations reveal elevated levels of calcitonin.
What would be your next step? 

A. Refer for urgent surgical evaluation
B. Repeat ultrasound scan after six months 
C. Order TSH receptor antibodies test 
D. Perform fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)
E. Start the patient on a trial of levothyroxine

Correct Answer: A 

Explanation: Patients with MEN2A have an increased risk of developing medullary thyroid carcinoma which secretes calcitonin leading to elevated levels seen on investigations such as serum calcitonin assay and urinary catecholamines and metanephrines tests. Surgical intervention is recommended for these patients due to high risk of malignancy and potential spread to surrounding structures if not treated promptly.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis including palpitations, sweating, and tremors. On examination, he has a heart rate of 140 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg. Blood tests reveal a TSH level of <0.01 mU/L (normal range: 0.27-4.20 mU/L) and free T4 level of >60 pmol/L (normal range: 10-23 pmol/L). The patient is started on beta-blockers for symptom control but remains persistently hyperthyroid despite treatment.

Which one of the following investigations would be most useful in determining the underlying cause of this patient's thyrotoxicosis? 

A. Thyroid ultrasound
B. Radioactive iodine uptake scan
C. Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin levels
D. Antithyroglobulin antibody levels
E. Fine needle aspiration biopsy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with Graves' disease, which accounts for approximately 80% of cases of thyrotoxicosis in the UK. Measurement of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) levels can help confirm the diagnosis by detecting the presence of antibodies that stimulate thyroid hormone production and release from the gland.

Question
A 55-year-old female is referred to your endocrine clinic with symptoms suggestive of thyrotoxicosis including weight loss, heat intolerance, and palpitations. Blood tests show a suppressed TSH level (<0.01 mU/L) and elevated free T4 level (>60 pmol/L). An ultrasound scan reveals multiple nodules within her thyroid gland.

Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate to further evaluate these nodules? 

A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
B. Computed tomography (CT) scan
C. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
D. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy
E. Radioactive iodine uptake scan

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Thyroid nodules are a common finding on ultrasound scans and can be benign or malignant. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the gold standard investigation for evaluating thyroid nodules, as it allows for cytological examination of cells obtained from the nodule to determine whether they are cancerous or not.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents with symptoms suggestive of thyrotoxicosis including weight loss, palpitations, and tremors. Blood tests show a suppressed TSH level (<0.01 mU/L) and elevated free T4 level (>60 pmol/L). She is started on carbimazole therapy but develops agranulocytosis after several weeks of treatment.

Which one of the following alternative treatments would be most appropriate in this patient? 

A. Levothyroxine replacement therapy
B. Radioactive iodine ablation therapy
C. Beta-blocker therapy alone
D. Surgical thyroidectomy
E. Corticosteroid therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Carbimazole is an antithyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism by inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis and release from the gland. However, it can cause serious side effects such as agranulocytosis, which requires immediate cessation of treatment and consideration of alternative therapies such as radioactive iodine ablation or surgical thyroidectomy depending on the individual patient's circumstances and preferences.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and high-grade fever for the past three days.

Question
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by certain types of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. TSS can affect anyone, but it is most commonly associated with menstruating women who use tampons. Other risk factors include recent surgery, skin infections, and the use of contraceptive devices.

A 25-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with a high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, and a rash that started on her palms and soles before spreading to the rest of her body. She reports using a menstrual cup for the first time during her current period. On examination, she appears unwell with a temperature of 40Â°C, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 22/min and SpO2 of 96% on room air.

Which one of the following is correct regarding toxic shock syndrome? 

A. The diagnosis is based solely on clinical presentation.
B. Blood culture is positive in all cases.
C. Treatment includes antibiotics and surgical debridement.
D. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) should be given routinely.
E. Tampon use is not a risk factor for TSS.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The diagnosis of TSS requires both clinical criteria (fever >38.9Â°C; hypotension; diffuse macular erythroderma; involvement of three or more organ systems) and laboratory criteria (evidence of renal impairment; liver involvement; thrombocytopenia; coagulopathy). Blood cultures are often negative in TSS because it is toxin-mediated rather than an invasive infection. Treatment involves prompt removal of any foreign bodies or infected tissues followed by antibiotic therapy directed against S.aureus or S.pyogenes depending on culture results. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be considered in severe cases, but there is limited evidence to support its use. Tampon use is a well-established risk factor for TSS.

Question
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but potentially fatal condition that can occur as a result of infection with certain types of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The condition can affect anyone, but it is most commonly associated with menstruating women who use tampons. Other risk factors include recent surgery, skin infections, and the use of contraceptive devices.

A 30-year-old woman presents to her GP with flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. She reports using tampons during her current period and has noticed an unusual odour from them. On examination, she appears unwell with a temperature of 39Â°C and blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg.

Which one of the following is correct regarding toxic shock syndrome? 

A. It only occurs in menstruating women.
B. It always involves skin rash.
C. It is caused by bacterial invasion rather than toxin production.
D. Treatment includes antiviral medication.
E. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to close contacts.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: While TSS is most commonly associated with menstruating women who use tampons, it can also occur in men and non-menstruating women who have other risk factors such as skin infections or surgical wounds. Skin rash is present in most cases but may not be apparent early on in the illness course. TSS is caused by toxins produced by certain bacteria rather than direct tissue invasion by these organisms. Treatment involves prompt removal of any foreign bodies or infected tissues followed by antibiotic therapy directed against S.aureus or S.pyogenes depending on culture results; antiviral medications are not effective against TSS. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given to close contacts of patients with confirmed or suspected TSS.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: While TSS is most commonly associated with menstruating women who use tampons, it can also occur in men and non-menstruating women who have other risk factors such as skin infections or surgical wounds. Skin rash is present in most cases but may not be apparent early on in the illness course; some patients may present without any obvious skin lesions at all. TSS is caused by toxins produced by certain bacteria rather than direct tissue invasion by these organisms. Treatment involves prompt removal of any foreign bodies or infected tissues followed by antibiotic therapy directed against S.aureus or S.pyogenes depending on culture results; antifungal medications are not effective against TSS. Early recognition and treatment are critical for improving outcomes in patients with TSS.

Question
A 60-year-old male patient with a history of chronic kidney disease is admitted to the hospital for an elective surgery. The patient's preoperative haemoglobin level was found to be 8 g/dL, and he was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells during the procedure. Two hours after the transfusion, the patient develops fever, chills, and shortness of breath. His temperature is 38.5Â°C, heart rate is 110 bpm, respiratory rate is 28/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. On examination, there are bilateral crackles heard in his lungs.
Which one of the following transfusion reactions is most likely responsible for this clinical presentation? 

A. Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)
B. Acute haemolytic reaction
C. Delayed haemolytic reaction
D. Febrile non-haemolytic blood transfusion reaction
E. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)

Correct Answer: E

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a history of sudden onset severe pain in his right shoulder and arm after lifting a heavy object at work. On examination, you note swelling and tenderness over the anterior aspect of the upper arm. He has weakness on abduction and external rotation of the shoulder joint. There is also sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the forearm.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Rotator cuff tear
B. Biceps tendon rupture
C. Brachial plexus injury 
D. Suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome
E. Axillary nerve injury

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with biceps tendon rupture, which commonly occurs due to sudden overload or trauma to the muscle-tendon unit during activities such as lifting heavy objects or performing forceful eccentric contractions against resistance. Patients often report a tearing sensation followed by acute pain in the affected area, along with swelling and ecchymosis over the anterior aspect of the upper arm. Weakness on abduction and external rotation of the shoulder joint may be present due to loss of function of both short head (flexion) and long head (abduction/external rotation) components of biceps muscle, while sensory loss over lateral aspect of forearm can occur due to involvement of musculocutaneous nerve that innervates biceps brachii muscle.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents with a complaint of numbness and tingling in her left hand for several weeks following an episode where she fell onto her outstretched hand while playing basketball. She reports difficulty gripping objects with her left hand and notes that her symptoms worsen at night.

Which one of the following is most likely? 

A. Carpal tunnel syndrome
B. Cubital tunnel syndrome
C. Radial nerve entrapment 
D. Pronator teres syndrome 
E. Thoracic outlet syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, which results from compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel at the wrist. Patients often report numbness, tingling, or pain in the distribution of the median nerve (digits 1-3 and half of digit 4), along with weakness or clumsiness of hand function. Symptoms may be worse at night due to prolonged wrist flexion during sleep exacerbating pressure on the median nerve.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents to his GP with a complaint of chronic shoulder pain that has been worsening over several months despite conservative management including physiotherapy and analgesics.

On examination, there is tenderness over the acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) and painful arc on abduction between 60-120 degrees.

Which one of the following is most likely? 

A. Rotator cuff tear
B. Adhesive capsulitis
C. Glenohumeral instability 
D. ACJ osteoarthritis 
E. Biceps tendonitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with ACJ osteoarthritis, which commonly occurs due to degenerative changes in the articular surfaces of clavicle and acromion bones that form this joint complex. Patients often report pain localized over ACJ region that worsens with overhead activities or direct pressure on affected area, along with limited range of motion particularly in abduction beyond 90 degrees (painful arc). Tenderness over ACJ can also be elicited on palpation while other causes such as rotator cuff tear or adhesive capsulitis may have more diffuse or deep-seated pain patterns.

A. Rapid antigen detection test (RADT) 
B. Throat culture 
C. Blood culture 
D. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing 
E. Serologic testing

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: While RADT may provide rapid results within minutes, it has lower sensitivity compared to throat culture which remains the gold standard for diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Blood culture is not indicated in this scenario as the patient does not appear to have systemic symptoms or signs of sepsis.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents with worsening shortness of breath, cough productive of yellow sputum, and fever for the past week. He has been prescribed antibiotics by his primary care physician but reports no improvement in his symptoms. On examination, he appears tired and tachypneic with bilateral wheezing on auscultation.
Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for this patient's exacerbation? 

A. Haemophilus influenzae 
B. Staphylococcus aureus 
C. Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
D. Klebsiella pneumoniae 
E. Streptococcus pneumoniae

Explanation: In patients with COPD, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of acute exacerbations and may be resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics due to its ability to form biofilms and acquire resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms such as conjugation and transformation.

Question
A 68-year-old male presents to his GP with a history of urinary incontinence for the past year. He reports that he has been experiencing leakage of urine during physical activities such as running, jumping or lifting weights. He also complains of nocturia and urgency. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

On examination, digital rectal examination reveals an enlarged prostate gland with no nodules or induration. Urinalysis shows no evidence of infection or hematuria. Post-void residual volume measured by bladder scan is 150 mL.

What is the most likely cause of this patientâs urinary incontinence? 

A. Overflow incontinence
B. Stress incontinence 
C. Mixed incontinence 
D. Urge incontinence 
E. Functional incontinence

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) which occurs due to weakness or damage to the pelvic floor muscles that support the urethra and bladder neck leading to involuntary loss of urine on exertion or effortful activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting heavy objects etc., while voiding remains normal.

Question
A 78-year-old woman presents with a complaint of recurrent episodes of urge urinary incontinence over the last few months despite regular pelvic floor muscle exercises and dietary modifications.
Her medical history includes hypertension, osteoporosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She takes multiple medications including diuretics, calcium supplements, bronchodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs).

Which medication from her current regimen could be contributing to her symptoms? 

A. Diuretics
B. Calcium supplements
C. Bronchodilators
D. ACEIs
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Diuretics are known to increase urine production and frequency, which can exacerbate symptoms of urge urinary incontinence (UUI), especially in older adults with reduced bladder capacity or detrusor overactivity.

Question
A 62-year-old male presents with a history of recurrent episodes of post-micturition dribble for the past year despite regular pelvic floor muscle exercises and alpha-blocker therapy.
His medical history is significant for BPH, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. He has no history of diabetes mellitus or neurological disorders.

On examination, digital rectal examination reveals an enlarged prostate gland without any nodules or induration. Urinalysis shows no evidence of infection or hematuria. Post-void residual volume measured by bladder scan is 50 mL.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's post-micturition dribble? 

A. Urethral stricture 
B. Detrusor underactivity 
C. Bladder outlet obstruction 
D. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction 
E. Prostatic urethral stenosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of overflow urinary incontinence due to incomplete emptying of the bladder caused by obstruction at the level of the prostatic urethra leading to increased residual urine volume and subsequent leakage after voiding cessation.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of renal colic over the past year. He has a history of hyperparathyroidism and has undergone parathyroidectomy in the past. An abdominal x-ray shows multiple radio-opaque stones in both kidneys, and an ultrasound confirms bilateral hydronephrosis. His serum calcium level is within normal limits, but his serum uric acid level is elevated. What is the most likely composition of the patient's renal calculi? 

A. Calcium oxalate
B. Uric acid
C. Cystine
D. Struvite 
E. Xanthine

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's history of hyperparathyroidism increases his risk for calcium-containing stones; however, his normal serum calcium levels make this less likely. Bilateral hydronephrosis suggests obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction or distal ureters, which can be caused by large or multiple stones that are not easily passed through the urinary tract. Elevated serum uric acid levels suggest a higher likelihood of uric acid stone formation, especially when combined with a low urine pH and dehydration due to chronic kidney disease.

Question
A 50-year-old female presents with acute onset right flank pain associated with nausea and vomiting for the past 24 hours. She has no significant medical history except for hypertension controlled on medication and occasional use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for headaches. On examination, she appears uncomfortable and tachycardic with tenderness over her right costovertebral angle region without rebound tenderness or guarding. Urinalysis reveals microscopic haematuria and pyuria without any bacterial growth on culture after 48 hours of incubation time.
What is the next best step in management? 

A. Start empiric antibiotics
B. Order a CT scan without contrast
C. Order a CT scan with contrast
D. Start intravenous fluids and analgesia 
E. Perform an urgent urological intervention

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis, which can be diagnosed by clinical findings of fever, flank pain, and urinary symptoms combined with laboratory evidence of pyuria and bacteriuria. However, the absence of bacterial growth on urine culture suggests that this may be due to atypical organisms such as mycobacteria or fungi, or non-infectious causes such as renal calculi or tumours. A CT scan with contrast is the most sensitive test for detecting renal calculi and other structural abnormalities in the urinary tract.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of nephrolithiasis over the past year despite dietary modifications and increased fluid intake. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled on oral hypoglycaemic agents and hypertension treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). His serum creatinine level is within normal limits, but his urinalysis shows microscopic haematuria without proteinuria or pyuria.
What is the most likely cause of his recurrent kidney stones? 

A. Hypercalciuria
B. Hyperoxaluria
C. Hypocitraturia
D. Hyperuricosuria 
E. Drug-induced nephropathy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk for hyperoxaluria due to increased oxalate synthesis from glycolic acid metabolism in the liver, especially when combined with ACEI use that reduces renal blood flow and promotes tubular reabsorption of calcium ions leading to supersaturation of urine with calcium oxalate crystals formation resulting in recurrent kidney stones formation even after lifestyle modifications are made like increasing fluid intake and dietary modifications.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a fever, chills, and flank pain on his left side. He has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, he is febrile with a temperature of 39Â°C and appears unwell. His blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg, heart rate is 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness over the left costovertebral angle. Laboratory investigations show an elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein level.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute pyelonephritis
B. Renal abscess
C. Nephrolithiasis
D. Prostatitis 
E. Bladder cancer

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presentation of fever, chills, flank pain, and elevated inflammatory markers suggest a renal abscess as the most likely diagnosis in this patient with risk factors for urinary tract infections such as diabetes mellitus.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of dysuria and frequency that have been ongoing for several months despite multiple courses of antibiotics prescribed by different healthcare providers. She has no significant past medical history or allergies but reports using spermicidal contraceptives during sexual intercourse with her partner who has not had any symptoms of genitourinary infection.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Refer to urology for cystoscopy 
B. Prescribe prophylactic antibiotics 
C. Order urine culture and sensitivity testing 
D. Perform pelvic ultrasound 
E. Test for sexually transmitted infections

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a painful rash on her left arm that has been present for 5 days. She reports feeling unwell and having a fever for the past week. On examination, there is a vesicular rash on her left upper arm with surrounding erythema and tenderness. The patient is diagnosed with herpes zoster.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient? Should she be treated with antiviral therapy? If so, what is the optimal duration of treatment? What other complications should be monitored? How can post-herpetic neuralgia be prevented?

A. Administer oral aciclovir for 7 days
B. Administer intravenous aciclovir for 14 days
C. Administer oral valaciclovir for 10 days
D. No antiviral therapy required
E. Refer to dermatology for further assessment

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Antiviral therapy should be initiated as soon as possible in patients presenting within 72 hours of onset of symptoms to reduce the severity and duration of acute pain associated with herpes zoster infection and prevent complications such as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). Oral valaciclovir or famciclovir are preferred over aciclovir due to their higher bioavailability and more convenient dosing schedules. Treatment should be continued for at least 7-10 days or until all lesions have crusted over, whichever is longer. Patients should also receive analgesics and topical agents to manage pain and itching associated with the rash, as well as regular follow-up to monitor for potential complications such as bacterial superinfection, ocular involvement, or neurological sequelae.

To prevent PHN, which can occur in up to one-third of patients after resolution of acute symptoms, early initiation of antiviral therapy is crucial, along with the use of adjunctive therapies such as gabapentin or pregabalin. Vaccination with the herpes zoster vaccine is also recommended for individuals aged 50 years and older to reduce the risk of developing herpes zoster and PHN.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents to his general practitioner with a painful rash on his left chest wall that has been present for 3 days. The patient reports feeling generally unwell and having a fever for the past week. On examination, there is a vesicular rash on his left chest wall in a dermatomal distribution with surrounding erythema and tenderness. The patient is diagnosed with herpes zoster.

What are the potential complications associated with herpes zoster? How can they be prevented? What is the role of corticosteroids in the management of acute herpes zoster? Should this patient receive antiviral therapy? If so, what is the optimal duration of treatment?

A. Administer oral aciclovir for 7 days
B. Administer intravenous aciclovir for 14 days
C. Administer oral valaciclovir for 10 days
D. No antiviral therapy required
E. Refer to dermatology for further assessment

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Potential complications associated with herpes zoster include post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), bacterial superinfection, ocular involvement (e.g., keratitis, uveitis), neurological sequelae (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis), and visceral dissemination (rare). To prevent these complications, early initiation of antiviral therapy within 72 hours of onset of symptoms is crucial, along with pain management using analgesics and topical agents.

The role of corticosteroids in the management of acute herpes zoster remains controversial due to conflicting evidence regarding their efficacy in reducing pain and preventing PHN. However, some guidelines recommend their use in selected patients with severe pain or high risk of PHN.

In this patient, antiviral therapy with oral valaciclovir should be initiated as soon as possible and continued for at least 7-10 days or until all lesions have crusted over, whichever is longer. The patient should also receive analgesics and topical agents to manage pain and itching associated with the rash, as well as regular follow-up to monitor for potential complications.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to her general practitioner with a painful rash on her right forehead that has been present for 5 days. She reports feeling generally unwell and having a fever for the past week. On examination, there is a vesicular rash on her right forehead in a dermatomal distribution involving the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The patient is diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO).

What are the potential ocular complications associated with HZO? How can they be prevented? What is the optimal management of acute HZO? Should this patient receive antiviral therapy? If so, what is the optimal duration of treatment?

A. Administer oral aciclovir for 7 days
B. Administer intravenous aciclovir for 14 days
C. Administer oral valaciclovir for 10 days
D. No antiviral therapy required
E. Refer to ophthalmology for further assessment

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Ocular complications associated with HZO include corneal involvement (e.g., keratitis), uveitis, glaucoma, cataract formation, and optic neuritis. To prevent these complications, early initiation of antiviral therapy within 72 hours of onset of symptoms is crucial along with prompt referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation and management.

The optimal management of acute HZO includes antiviral therapy with oral valaciclovir or famciclovir for at least 7-10 days or until all lesions have crusted over, whichever is longer. Patients should also receive topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics to reduce inflammation and prevent complications such as corneal scarring or adhesions.

In this patient, antiviral therapy with oral valaciclovir should be initiated as soon as possible and continued for at least 7-10 days or until all lesions have crusted over, whichever is longer. The patient should also be referred to an ophthalmologist for further assessment and management of potential ocular complications.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe pain and swelling in his right leg. He reports having a history of varicose veins, but denies any recent trauma or surgery. On examination, there is marked tenderness and erythema over the entire right leg, with palpable cords along the course of superficial veins. The patient's vital signs are stable, but laboratory studies reveal an elevated D-dimer level.

Which of the following options is most appropriate for this patient?

A. Immediate anticoagulation with heparin
B. Surgical intervention to remove affected veins
C. Compression stockings and observation
D. Thrombolytic therapy
E. Duplex ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient has likely developed acute superficial thrombophlebitis (STP) secondary to his underlying varicose veins, which can predispose to clot formation within these dilated vessels due to stasis and endothelial damage. Given the presence of extensive inflammation and palpable cords on exam, immediate anticoagulation with heparin is recommended to prevent extension into deep venous system or pulmonary embolism.

Question
A 58-year-old woman presents for evaluation of her longstanding varicose veins that have become increasingly symptomatic over time, including heaviness, aching, itching and occasional bleeding from ruptured vessels. She has no significant past medical history other than hypertension controlled on medication.

On examination, she has prominent tortuous veins involving both legs without evidence of skin changes or ulcers. Ankle-brachial index is normal bilaterally.

Which of the following options represents first-line treatment for this patient? 

A. Endovenous laser ablation 
B. Sclerotherapy 
C. Radiofrequency ablation 
D. Conservative management with compression stockings 
E. Surgical ligation and stripping

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Conservative management with compression stockings is the first-line treatment for symptomatic varicose veins, as it can improve venous return, reduce symptoms, prevent complications such as thrombophlebitis or skin changes, and delay progression of disease. Endovenous laser ablation, sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation and surgical ligation/stripping are reserved for patients who have failed conservative measures or have more severe disease.

Question
A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of recurrent episodes of leg swelling and discomfort over the past few months. He reports a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg several years ago that was treated with anticoagulation therapy. On examination, there is mild pitting edema involving both legs up to mid-calf level without erythema or tenderness. There are no visible varicosities.

Which of the following options is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? 

A. Recurrent DVT 
B. Chronic venous insufficiency 
C. Lymphedema 
D. Arterial insufficiency 
E. Congestive heart failure

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient has chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which results from valvular incompetence within deep or superficial veins leading to retrograde blood flow and increased hydrostatic pressure within lower extremity vasculature causing edema, pain and other symptoms similar to those seen in varicose veins but without visible dilated vessels on exam. CVI can be caused by prior DVTs, trauma, surgery or congenital abnormalities among others and may require further evaluation with duplex ultrasound imaging to determine extent of involvement and appropriate management strategies including compression therapy or endovascular intervention if indicated based on severity of symptoms.

Question
A 29-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic for her routine check-up at 28 weeks gestation. She has a past medical history of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and was diagnosed with vasa praevia on her 20-week anomaly scan. The patient is asymptomatic, but you note that she has not had any additional scans since her diagnosis.

What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?

A. Immediate hospital admission until delivery
B. Serial ultrasound scans every two weeks until delivery
C. Elective caesarean section at 36 weeks gestation
D. Induction of labour at term
E. Expectant management

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Vasa praevia is a rare obstetric complication where fetal vessels cross or run in close proximity to the internal cervical os without being protected by placental tissue or umbilical cord Wharton's jelly, which can lead to fetal exsanguination if these vessels rupture during labour or membrane rupture before onset of labour. In cases where vasa praevia is identified prenatally, elective caesarean section should be performed before the onset of labour to minimize fetal morbidity and mortality.

Question
A 32-year-old primigravida presents at 34 weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. Her past medical history is unremarkable, and there are no significant findings on examination except for mild uterine contractions.

An emergency ultrasound shows a low-lying placenta with velamentous cord insertion and suspected vasa praevia.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Administer corticosteroids and antibiotics
B. Perform an immediate caesarean section 
C. Monitor maternal vital signs closely 
D. Insert an intrauterine pressure catheter 
E. Prepare for induction of labour

Correct Answer: B 

Explanation: In cases of suspected vasa praevia, an immediate caesarean section should be performed to minimize fetal morbidity and mortality. Administering corticosteroids and antibiotics or monitoring maternal vital signs closely may not prevent fetal exsanguination if the vessels rupture during labour.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents at 36 weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding. She has a past medical history significant for placenta previa diagnosed on her 20-week anomaly scan. The patient is asymptomatic, but you note that she has not had any additional scans since her diagnosis.

An emergency ultrasound shows a low-lying placenta with suspected vasa praevia.

What is the most appropriate management plan? 

A. Immediate hospital admission until delivery 
B. Serial ultrasound scans every two weeks until delivery
C. Elective caesarean section at 38 weeks gestation 
D. Induction of labour at term 
E. Expectant management

Correct Answer: C 

Explanation: In cases where both placenta previa and vasa praevia are identified prenatally, elective caesarean section should be performed before the onset of labour to minimize fetal morbidity and mortality due to potential complications from both conditions. Serial ultrasound scans or expectant management may increase the risk of fetal exsanguination if these vessels rupture during labour or membrane rupture before onset of labour.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pityriasis rosea 
B. Guttate psoriasis 
C. Drug eruption 
D. Secondary syphilis 
E. Viral exanthem 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical picture described is consistent with pityriasis rosea, a self-limited inflammatory skin condition that typically affects young adults and presents with a herald patch followed by multiple smaller lesions in a Christmas tree pattern on the trunk and extremities. It can be mistaken for other viral exanthems but does not have associated systemic symptoms or mucosal involvement.

Question
A 7-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother due to a rash that started on his face and has now spread to involve his trunk, arms, and legs over the past 2 days. He reports feeling itchy but otherwise well. On examination, there are multiple erythematous macules and papules that have coalesced into larger plaques with central clearing on the cheeks, forehead, nose, chin, and periorbital regions as well as scattered lesions on the upper chest and back.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Varicella-zoster virus
B. Measles virus
C. Rubella virus
D. Parvovirus B19
E. Human herpesvirus-6

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical picture described is consistent with rubella (German measles), a contagious viral illness that presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia/arthritis, and a characteristic rash starting on the face before spreading to the trunk and limbs within 24 hours. The rash consists of discrete pink-red macules that may coalesce into confluent areas with sparing of the palms/soles and face/hairline junctions. Vaccination has greatly reduced the incidence of rubella in developed countries but outbreaks still occur in unvaccinated populations or those with waning immunity.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of watery diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. He reports feeling generally unwell and has not been able to tolerate any food or drink for the past 24 hours. His medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease stage 3.
On examination, his temperature is 38.5 oC, blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate is 110 beats per minute and he appears dehydrated with dry mucous membranes.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? 

A. Norovirus
B. Rotavirus 
C. Adenovirus 
D. Astrovirus 
E. Sapovirus

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests viral gastroenteritis as the most likely diagnosis, given the acute onset of symptoms including fever, vomiting and diarrhoea in an otherwise healthy individual with no recent travel history or exposure to contaminated food/water sources. Norovirus is one of the most common causes of viral gastroenteritis in adults and can lead to severe dehydration in vulnerable populations such as those with pre-existing medical conditions.

Question
A previously healthy 25-year-old woman presents to her GP with a week-long history of intermittent abdominal cramps, bloating and loose stools which have become progressively worse over time. She denies any recent travel or sick contacts but reports having eaten sushi from a local restaurant several days prior to symptom onset.
On examination, she appears well hydrated with normal vital signs and no evidence of dehydration or weight loss.
Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for her symptoms? 

A. Vibrio parahaemolyticus
B. Listeria monocytogenes
C. Yersinia enterocolitica
D. Clostridium perfringens
E. Aeromonas hydrophila

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests a possible foodborne illness, given the recent consumption of sushi and symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a common cause of seafood-associated gastroenteritis and can lead to watery diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and fever.

Question
A 40-year-old man presents to his GP with a 2-week history of persistent diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. He reports having recently returned from a trip to Southeast Asia where he consumed street food on several occasions.
On examination, he appears dehydrated with dry mucous membranes and reduced skin turgor.
Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for his symptoms? 

A. Entamoeba histolytica 
B. Cryptosporidium parvum 
C. Cyclospora cayetanensis 
D. Rotavirus 
E. Adenovirus

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests a possible parasitic infection acquired during travel to an endemic area, given the prolonged duration of symptoms and exposure history. Cyclospora cayetanensis is a protozoan parasite commonly associated with contaminated water or food sources in tropical regions and can lead to chronic diarrhoea, weight loss and dehydration if left untreated.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a history of fever, malaise, and abdominal pain for the past week. He reports no significant medical history but admits to having unprotected sex with multiple partners in the last six months. On examination, he is found to be icteric and has hepatomegaly on palpation. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and serological testing confirms acute hepatitis B infection.

Which of the following is true regarding this patient's prognosis? 

A. The patient will require antiviral therapy for at least 6 months.
B. The patient may develop chronic hepatitis B infection.
C. The patient is at increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
D. The patient should receive a liver transplant immediately.
E. None of the above.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Patients with acute hepatitis B are at an increased risk of developing chronic infection, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This risk is higher in patients who are co-infected with HIV or other viral infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). Therefore, close monitoring of these patients is essential to detect any progression towards chronicity or development of HCC.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort for the past month. She denies any significant medical history but admits to consuming alcohol regularly for several years. On examination, she has mild jaundice and tender hepatomegaly on palpation.

Which one of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Abdominal ultrasound
B. Liver biopsy
C. Hepatitis serology
D. CT scan abdomen
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abdomen

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of liver disease along with a history of alcohol consumption, an abdominal ultrasound is the most appropriate initial investigation. It can detect liver enlargement, focal lesions, and evidence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension. Further investigations such as liver biopsy may be required to establish a definitive diagnosis.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents with complaints of fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss for the past two months. He reports no significant medical history but admits to injecting drugs regularly for several years. On examination, he has mild jaundice and hepatomegaly on palpation.

Which one of the following viral infections should be suspected? 

A. Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
B. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
C. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
D. Hepatitis D virus (HDV)
E. Hepatitis E virus (HEV)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients with a history of intravenous drug use presenting with symptoms suggestive of hepatitis along with hepatomegaly and jaundice, HCV infection should be suspected as it is commonly associated with this risk factor. Testing for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and determine the genotype for further management options such as antiviral therapy.

Question
A 62-year-old female presents to the ophthalmologist with a complaint of difficulty seeing objects on her left side. She reports that she has noticed this problem for several months, but it has become progressively worse over time. On examination, visual acuity is normal in both eyes, and there is no evidence of optic disc swelling or retinal abnormalities. However, confrontation testing reveals a left homonymous hemianopia.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's visual field defect? 

A. Optic nerve lesion
B. Chiasmal lesion
C. Posterior cerebral artery infarction
D. Occipital lobe lesion
E. Migraine aura

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of a homonymous hemianopia suggests a lesion in the occipital lobe, which is responsible for processing visual information from both eyes.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of headaches and blurred vision in his right eye for the past week. He reports that he has also been experiencing episodes of dizziness and nausea during this time period. On examination, visual acuity is normal in both eyes, but there is evidence of an inferior altitudinal field defect in the right eye.

Which one of the following conditions should be suspected? 

A. Multiple sclerosis 
B. Pituitary adenoma 
C. Glaucoma 
D. Retinitis pigmentosa 
E. Ischemic optic neuropathy 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: An inferior altitudinal field defect suggests involvement of the superior optic radiations or parietal lobe, which can occur due to compression by a pituitary adenoma.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents to her ophthalmologist with complaints of difficulty reading and recognizing faces on her left side for several weeks now.On examination,she was found to have a right homonymous hemianopia.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's visual field defect? 

A. Optic nerve lesion
B. Chiasmal lesion
C. Posterior cerebral artery infarction
D. Occipital lobe lesion
E. Migraine aura

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presence of a homonymous hemianopia suggests a posterior cerebral artery infarction, which can result in damage to the occipital cortex and subsequent visual field loss on the opposite side of the body.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the GP with a history of chronic alcoholism and malnourishment. He reports experiencing fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty walking. On examination, he has bilateral lower limb weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes. Laboratory investigations reveal low serum vitamin B12 levels.
Which one of the following is most likely responsible for his symptoms? 

A. Vitamin D deficiency
B. Vitamin E deficiency
C. Vitamin K deficiency 
D. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency
E. Vitamin C deficiency

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Chronic alcoholism can lead to thiamine deficiency due to poor dietary intake and impaired absorption in the gut. Thiamine plays an important role in energy metabolism and nerve function, hence its deficiency can cause neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of hair loss over the past few months along with dry skin and brittle nails. She mentions that she follows a strict vegan diet for ethical reasons but does not take any supplements or fortified foods.
On examination, there are areas of alopecia on her scalp and thinning of hair at the periphery.
Which one of the following vitamins is most likely deficient? 

A. Vitamin D
B. Vitamin E
C. Vitamin K 
D. Vitamin B7 (biotin)
E. Vitamin B3 (niacin)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Biotin is essential for healthy hair growth as it helps in protein synthesis necessary for keratin production which forms hair strands, nails, and skin cells.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of joint pain and stiffness especially in his hands over the past few weeks along with generalised fatigue and weight loss.
On examination, there is tenderness and swelling of the metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated serum levels of inflammatory markers.
Which one of the following vitamins has been shown to have a role in reducing inflammation? 

A. Vitamin D
B. Vitamin E
C. Vitamin K 
D. Vitamin B12
E. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation by scavenging free radicals produced during cellular metabolism or exposure to toxins, radiation, or pollutants. It has been shown to be beneficial in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis where joint inflammation plays a major role in disease progression.

Question
A 65-year-old male presents to the GP with a six-month history of progressive fatigue, weakness, and numbness in his hands and feet. He has a past medical history significant for gastric bypass surgery five years ago. On examination, he appears pale, and his tongue is beefy red. Blood tests reveal macrocytic anaemia with low levels of vitamin B12 and folate. The GP suspects pernicious anaemia.

What diagnostic test would confirm this diagnosis? 

A. Schilling's test
B. Serum gastrin level
C. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies
D. Anti-parietal cell antibodies
E. Bone marrow biopsy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition that results in vitamin B12 deficiency due to the lack of intrinsic factor production by parietal cells in the stomach lining, which impairs absorption of vitamin B12 from food sources. The presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies confirms the diagnosis.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion for several months. She reports no gastrointestinal symptoms or neurological deficits but states that she follows a strict vegan diet for ethical reasons and takes no supplements regularly.

Blood tests show macrocytic anaemia with low serum vitamin B12 levels but normal folate levels.

What other laboratory finding is expected? 

A. Elevated homocysteine levels 
B. Low homocysteine levels 
C. High methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels 
D. Low MMA levels 
E. Normal MMA and homocysteine levels

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in converting methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA via its coenzyme form adenosylcobalamin; thus, its deficiency leads to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in blood and urine. Elevated MMA levels are a sensitive and specific marker for vitamin B12 deficiency.

Question
A 58-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of numbness, tingling, and weakness in his legs that have been progressing over several months. He reports no gastrointestinal symptoms but admits to heavy alcohol consumption for years.

Blood tests reveal macrocytic anaemia with low serum vitamin B12 levels but normal folate levels. The GP suspects alcoholic neuropathy.

What other investigation is necessary? 

A. Serum copper level
B. Serum zinc level
C. Serum thiamine level
D. Serum magnesium level
E. Serum calcium level

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Chronic alcoholism can lead to malnutrition and subsequent vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause peripheral neuropathy similar to diabetic neuropathy or pernicious anaemia. However, thiamine deficiency is also common in chronic alcoholics and can cause Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome; thus, it is essential to measure serum thiamine levels before treating with high doses of vitamin B12 alone as this may worsen neurological symptoms due to underlying thiamine deficiency.

Question
A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, distension and vomiting. On examination, his abdomen is tender and tympanic on percussion. His medical history includes chronic constipation and previous episodes of volvulus requiring surgical intervention. CT scan reveals a sigmoid volvulus with evidence of bowel ischemia. The patient is taken for surgery where a segmental resection of the affected colon is performed.

Which one of the following statements regarding sigmoid volvulus is correct? 

A. It typically affects younger patients.
B. It is more common in females than males.
C. It can be managed conservatively in most cases.
D. Colonoscopy should be avoided in suspected cases due to risk of perforation.
E. Recurrence rates are low after surgical intervention.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Sigmoid volvulus occurs when there is twisting or torsion of the sigmoid colon around its mesentery leading to obstruction and ischemia of the affected section of bowel. It commonly affects elderly patients with a history of chronic constipation or prior episodes of volvulus, as seen in this case scenario. Females are more commonly affected than males due to anatomical differences in pelvic structure and hormonal factors affecting colonic motility. Conservative management may be attempted initially but definitive treatment usually requires endoscopic decompression or surgical intervention depending on severity and recurrence rates remain high even after successful treatment.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, bloating, nausea and vomiting over several months that have been increasing in frequency and intensity despite conservative measures such as dietary modifications and laxatives. She has no significant past medical history apart from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosed several years ago which has been well controlled until recently when her symptoms worsened significantly.

On examination, she appears uncomfortable but vital signs are stable; abdominal exam reveals distension and tenderness in the left lower quadrant. CT scan shows a closed loop obstruction with evidence of volvulus involving the sigmoid colon.

Which one of the following is an important risk factor for sigmoid volvulus? 

A. Previous abdominal surgery
B. Smoking
C. High-fibre diet
D. Regular exercise
E. Normal bowel habits

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Several factors have been identified as predisposing to sigmoid volvulus, including a history of chronic constipation, IBS or other motility disorders affecting colonic function; advanced age; neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease or spinal cord injuries that affect gut innervation; and previous abdominal surgery which can lead to adhesions and altered anatomy increasing the risk of torsion. Smoking has not been consistently associated with increased risk while high-fibre diet and regular exercise are protective against constipation but do not necessarily prevent volvulus from occurring.

Question
A 30-year-old male presents with acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting after eating a large meal at a fast-food restaurant. He reports no significant medical history apart from occasional episodes of heartburn and reflux treated with antacids over-the-counter.

On examination, he appears uncomfortable and restless; vital signs reveal tachycardia and hypotension; abdominal exam reveals diffuse tenderness without rebound or guarding but there is tympany on percussion.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute pancreatitis 
B. Gastric outlet obstruction 
C. Mesenteric ischemia 
D. Sigmoid volvulus 
E. Perforated peptic ulcer

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation in this case suggests an acute abdomen requiring urgent evaluation and management to avoid potential complications such as sepsis or perforation if left untreated. The differential diagnosis includes several conditions that can cause similar symptoms such as acute pancreatitis, gastric outlet obstruction, mesenteric ischemia or perforated peptic ulcer. However, the history of a large meal followed by sudden onset of symptoms and physical exam findings of diffuse abdominal tenderness with tympany on percussion are highly suggestive of sigmoid volvulus which can occur in patients with underlying motility disorders or anatomical abnormalities affecting colonic function.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath and chest pain at 36 weeks gestation. She has a history of previous venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is currently taking low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). On examination, she is tachypnoeic and hypoxic. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram confirms bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli. What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Continue LMWH therapy
B. Switch to unfractionated heparin (UFH)
C. Start warfarin immediately
D. Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
E. Perform an inferior vena cava filter insertion

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with VTE during pregnancy or puerperium, therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH or UFH should be continued until delivery and then switched to oral anticoagulants if required postpartum. However, in cases of acute massive PE, switching from LMWH to UFH may be necessary due to its shorter half-life and reversibility.

Question
A 25-year-old primigravida at 32 weeks gestation presents with painful swelling in her left leg that started two days ago. The ultrasound scan shows extensive deep vein thrombosis extending from the popliteal vein up into the common femoral vein. Which one of the following statements regarding anticoagulation in pregnancy is correct? 

A. Warfarin can be used safely after the first trimester
B. Low molecular weight heparin does not cross the placenta
C. Unfractionated heparin requires monitoring of anti-Xa levels
D. Direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in pregnancy 
E. Anticoagulation can be stopped at 6 weeks postpartum

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Unfractionated heparin is the preferred anticoagulant in pregnancy due to its large size, which prevents it from crossing the placenta. However, it requires monitoring of anti-Xa levels to ensure therapeutic efficacy and avoid bleeding complications.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite being on long-term warfarin therapy. She is currently pregnant at 16 weeks gestation. Further investigation reveals that she has protein S deficiency. What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Continue warfarin throughout pregnancy
B. Switch to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
C. Administer aspirin prophylaxis 
D. Perform inferior vena cava filter insertion
E. Consider early delivery at 34 weeks gestation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with recurrent VTE while on oral anticoagulation or those with severe thrombophilia, LMWH should be used for both primary and secondary prophylaxis during pregnancy and puerperium as it provides more predictable anticoagulation than unfractionated heparin and does not cross the placenta like warfarin does.

Question
A 45-year-old woman with a history of chronic alcoholism presents to the emergency department with acute confusion, ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. She is unable to provide any history due to her altered mental status. On examination, she has horizontal nystagmus, bilateral ptosis and an unsteady gait. Her blood tests reveal low levels of thiamine but normal liver function tests. CT scan of the brain shows no abnormalities. Which one of the following is true? 

A. This patient does not have Wernicke's encephalopathy as there are no structural abnormalities on CT scan.
B. The diagnosis can be confirmed by MRI showing characteristic changes in the mammillary bodies.
C. Treatment should begin immediately with high dose intravenous thiamine followed by oral supplementation.
D. If left untreated, this condition can progress to Korsakoff's syndrome which is irreversible.
E. All of the above are correct.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Wernicke's encephalopathy is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment with high dose intravenous thiamine to prevent progression to Korsakoff's syndrome which is characterized by permanent memory loss and confabulation. While MRI may show characteristic changes in the mammillary bodies, it is not necessary for diagnosis and treatment should not be delayed while waiting for imaging results.

Question
A 60-year-old man with a long-standing history of alcohol abuse presents with confusion, diplopia and difficulty walking for several days. His wife reports that he has been drinking heavily over the past few weeks and has lost weight recently due to poor appetite. On examination, he has horizontal nystagmus, bilateral ptosis and an unsteady gait consistent with cerebellar dysfunction. He also has mild dysarthria but no other focal neurological deficits are noted. Laboratory investigations reveal low serum levels of thiamine and elevated liver enzymes. Which one of the following is true? 

A. This patient has hepatic encephalopathy due to his alcohol abuse.
B. The diagnosis can be confirmed by EEG showing diffuse slowing of brain waves.
C. Treatment should begin with lactulose to reduce ammonia levels in the blood.
D. Wernicke's encephalopathy can occur in patients with normal liver function tests.
E. All of the above are incorrect.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: While this patient may also have hepatic dysfunction, his presentation is more consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy which can occur even in patients with normal liver function tests. EEG findings may show nonspecific abnormalities but are not diagnostic for this condition. Treatment should begin immediately with high dose intravenous thiamine followed by oral supplementation, and lactulose would not be indicated in this case.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute confusion, ataxia and ophthalmoplegia after undergoing gastric bypass surgery for obesity two weeks ago. He reports that he has been unable to eat or drink much since the procedure due to nausea and vomiting. On examination, he has horizontal nystagmus, bilateral ptosis and an unsteady gait consistent with cerebellar dysfunction. Laboratory investigations reveal low serum levels of thiamine and electrolyte imbalances including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Which one of the following is true? 

A. This patient does not have Wernicke's encephalopathy as it typically occurs only in chronic alcoholics.
B. The diagnosis can be confirmed by CT scan showing characteristic changes in the mammillary bodies.
C. Treatment should begin immediately with high dose intravenous thiamine followed by oral supplementation.
D. If left untreated, this condition can progress to Korsakoff's syndrome which is irreversible.
E. All of the above are incorrect.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Wernicke's encephalopathy can occur in patients with malnutrition or other conditions that lead to thiamine deficiency, not just chronic alcoholics. While MRI may show characteristic changes in the mammillary bodies, CT scan would not be diagnostic for this condition. Treatment should begin immediately with high dose intravenous thiamine followed by oral supplementation to prevent progression to Korsakoff's syndrome which is characterized by permanent memory loss and confabulation.

Question
A 6-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department with a persistent cough that has been present for over two weeks. The mother reports that the child has had some difficulty breathing and feeding, and there have been episodes of vomiting after coughing fits. On examination, you note tachypnoea, intercostal recession, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflation and peribronchial cuffing.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Bronchiolitis
B. Pneumonia 
C. Asthma 
D. Pertussis 
E. Cystic fibrosis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this infant is consistent with pertussis (whooping cough), which can be severe in infants under six months old who are not yet fully vaccinated against it. The characteristic features include paroxysmal cough followed by an inspiratory 'whoop', post-tussive emesis, and apnea spells in young infants. Diagnosis can be confirmed by PCR or culture from nasopharyngeal swabs or blood samples taken during the catarrhal stage of illness.

Question
A 10-year-old boy presents to his GP with a persistent dry cough that has lasted for more than four weeks despite treatment with antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. He denies any fever, runny nose or sore throat but complains of fatigue and occasional chest pain when he coughs hard enough.

Which one of these investigations would be most helpful? 

A. Spirometry
B. High-resolution CT scan
C. Sweat chloride test
D. Echocardiogram
E. Skin prick testing

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with chronic cough lasting more than three weeks without an obvious cause, high-resolution CT scan (HRCT) of the chest may help identify underlying structural abnormalities such as bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. These conditions can mimic the symptoms of whooping cough and may require further investigation or referral to a specialist.

Question
A 16-year-old girl presents with a persistent cough that has lasted for more than six weeks since she had a cold. She reports no fever, night sweats, weight loss or haemoptysis but is concerned about missing school due to her symptoms. Her chest x-ray is normal, and spirometry shows mild airflow obstruction with reversibility after inhalation of salbutamol.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Post-viral cough
B. Asthma 
C. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
D. Tuberculosis 
E. Pertussis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Post-viral cough is a common cause of chronic cough in adolescents and adults following an upper respiratory tract infection caused by viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus or adenovirus. The cough usually resolves within eight weeks without specific treatment but can be disruptive to daily activities and quality of life. Treatment options include reassurance, hydration, and symptomatic relief with antitussives or bronchodilators if necessary.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In this patient with pre-existing CKD, acute tubular necrosis is the most likely cause of AKI due to sepsis-induced hypoperfusion leading to ischemic injury in already compromised kidneys.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a rash that has been spreading rapidly over her body for the past 24 hours. She reports feeling generally unwell with a fever, headache and muscle pain. On examination, there is an erythematous maculopapular rash across her trunk and limbs which appears to be spreading in a centrifugal pattern. The patient also has conjunctivitis and oral ulcers.

Which of the following is most likely to be seen on blood tests? 

A. Elevated liver enzymes
B. Low white cell count
C. High platelet count
D. Raised creatinine kinase levels
E. Positive ANA test

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which can lead to multi-organ failure if not treated promptly. TSS is caused by toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, which can enter the bloodstream through wounds or mucosal surfaces such as the vagina during menstruation or childbirth. Blood tests may show raised creatinine kinase levels due to muscle breakdown, as well as elevated liver enzymes and low white cell counts.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents to his GP with a painful rash on his left chest wall that started 2 days ago. He describes it as burning and stabbing in nature, worse at night and aggravated by clothing rubbing against it. There are clusters of vesicles on an erythematous base distributed along the T4 dermatome.

Which of the following would be most effective in reducing his symptoms? 

A. Topical corticosteroids 
B. Oral acyclovir 
C. Intravenous immunoglobulin 
D. Amitriptyline 
E. Capsaicin cream 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient has shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. Oral antiviral therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir can shorten the duration and severity of symptoms if started within 72 hours of rash onset, but it is unlikely to provide complete pain relief. Topical corticosteroids may reduce inflammation but are not recommended for use on active lesions due to the risk of bacterial superinfection. Capsaicin cream can be effective in some patients but may cause burning and irritation at the application site. Intravenous immunoglobulin has no proven benefit in treating shingles. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, can help relieve neuropathic pain associated with shingles by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to her GP with a persistent rash that she has had for several weeks despite using over-the-counter creams and emollients. She reports that it is very itchy and has spread from her hands to her arms, legs and trunk. On examination, there are erythematous papules and plaques with excoriation marks scattered across her body.

Which of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Skin biopsy 
B. Patch testing 
C. Complete blood count 
D. Chest X-ray 
E. Serum protein electrophoresis 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's clinical presentation suggests chronic eczema (atopic dermatitis), which is characterized by pruritic, dry skin lesions that tend to occur in flexural areas such as the elbows, knees and wrists. Patch testing may be useful in identifying allergic triggers such as nickel or fragrances, but this patient does not have a history suggestive of contact dermatitis. A complete blood count would not be specific for eczema but could reveal eosinophilia in some cases. A chest X-ray and serum protein electrophoresis would be more appropriate for investigating systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis or multiple myeloma, which can present with skin lesions but are less likely given the patient's age and clinical features. A skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis of eczema by showing spongiosis (intercellular edema) and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the epidermis and dermis.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to the clinic with a history of alcohol addiction and multiple failed attempts at quitting. He reports experiencing intense cravings for alcohol, which he finds difficult to resist. His family has expressed concern about his drinking habits, as he often drinks alone and in secret.

After conducting a thorough assessment, you diagnose him with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Which medication would be most appropriate for managing his symptoms? 

A. Naltrexone
B. Acamprosate
C. Disulfiram
D. Topiramate
E. Baclofen

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that works by blocking the pleasurable effects of alcohol on the brain, thereby reducing cravings and decreasing the likelihood of relapse. It can be taken orally or via injection and is generally well-tolerated.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after overdosing on heroin. She is unresponsive and requires intubation for airway protection. Her medical history is significant for chronic pain due to fibromyalgia, for which she has been prescribed opioids.

Upon further investigation, it is discovered that she has been obtaining additional opioids from various sources without her doctor's knowledge or consent.

What term describes this behaviour? 

A. Substance abuse 
B. Substance dependence 
C. Addiction 
D. Tolerance 
E. Withdrawal

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Substance dependence refers to a pattern of drug use characterized by tolerance (the need for increasing amounts of the substance to achieve the desired effect), withdrawal symptoms upon cessation, and compulsive drug-seeking behavior despite negative consequences.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents with severe anxiety and panic attacks following abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines, which he had been taking regularly for several months under medical supervision.

Which type of substance withdrawal does this patient most likely have? 

A. Alcohol withdrawal 
B. Opioid withdrawal 
C. Stimulant withdrawal 
D. Sedative-hypnotic withdrawal 
E. Cannabinoid withdrawal

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Benzodiazepines are a class of sedative-hypnotic drugs commonly used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. Abrupt discontinuation can lead to a range of withdrawal symptoms, including rebound anxiety, insomnia, tremors, and seizures in severe cases. Gradual tapering is recommended to minimize the risk of withdrawal complications.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the allergy clinic with a history of recurrent episodes of angioedema and urticaria for the past six months. She reports that these symptoms occur without any identifiable trigger, and they are not associated with any other systemic symptoms. Her medical history is significant for asthma, which is well-controlled on inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Physical examination reveals diffuse erythematous rash over her trunk and extremities, along with swelling of her lips and tongue.
What is the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient? 

A. Serum tryptase levels
B. Skin prick test
C. Patch testing
D. Food challenge test
E. Radioallergosorbent test (RAST)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests an underlying mast cell-mediated disorder such as idiopathic angioedema or hereditary angioedema (HAE). Measurement of serum tryptase levels can help differentiate between these two conditions.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to his General Practitioner with complaints of nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy eyes, and cough for the past month. He reports that he has had similar symptoms every spring since childhood but never sought medical attention before now. He denies any fever or shortness of breath but admits to occasional wheezing during exercise.
On physical examination, there is no evidence of respiratory distress or cyanosis; however, there are bilateral expiratory wheezes heard on auscultation.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Allergic rhinitis
B. Non-allergic rhinitis
C. Asthma exacerbation
D. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
E. Pulmonary embolism

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's history and physical examination findings suggest an acute exacerbation of asthma. The presence of wheezing and cough, along with a history of seasonal allergies, supports the diagnosis.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations. He reports that he has a history of multiple drug allergies but is unable to recall the names or details of these medications. On examination, his blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation on room air is 88%. There are diffuse crackles heard on auscultation bilaterally.
What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. Intramuscular adrenaline injection
B. High-flow oxygen therapy
C. Inhaled bronchodilators
D. Intravenous corticosteroids
E. Nebulized magnesium sulfate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests an acute severe asthma attack or anaphylaxis due to a medication allergy. The first step in management should be high-flow oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation while further evaluation and treatment are initiated.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset numbness and tingling in her right arm, hand and fingers. She reports that she woke up with these symptoms and they have persisted for the past hour. On examination, there is decreased sensation to light touch in a dermatomal distribution over the C6-C8 nerve roots on the right side. There is no motor weakness or reflex changes noted. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but denies any recent trauma or injury to her neck or shoulder region. What is the most likely cause of her symptoms? 

A. Thoracic outlet syndrome
B. Cervical disc herniation 
C. Brachial plexus neuropathy 
D. Carpal tunnel syndrome 
E. Raynaud's phenomenon 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The sudden onset of numbness and tingling in a specific dermatomal distribution suggests an acute neurological event such as cervical disc herniation which can compress spinal nerves leading to altered sensation in specific regions supplied by those nerves.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents with complaints of progressive numbness and tingling in his feet bilaterally for the past six months along with difficulty walking due to unsteadiness on his feet. He also reports occasional bladder dysfunction and erectile dysfunction for the same duration. On examination, he has reduced vibration sense at both ankles, absent ankle reflexes bilaterally, spasticity in both lower limbs and positive Babinski sign bilaterally indicating upper motor neuron involvement. MRI spine shows multiple T2-hyperintense lesions involving thoracic cord segments suggestive of demyelinating disease.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Multiple sclerosis 
B. Diabetic neuropathy 
C. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 
D. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 
E. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of progressive sensory symptoms along with motor dysfunction and bladder/bowel involvement in a young patient along with MRI findings suggestive of demyelination point towards the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of numbness and tingling in both hands for the past six months, which is worse at night and wakes him up from sleep. He also reports weakness in grip strength and difficulty holding objects such as a pen or fork. On examination, there is decreased sensation to light touch over the median nerve distribution bilaterally along with positive Tinel's sign at the wrist on tapping over the median nerve. There is also reduced grip strength bilaterally compared to normal values.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Ulnar neuropathy 
B. Radial neuropathy 
C. Carpal tunnel syndrome 
D. Cubital tunnel syndrome 
E. Brachial plexus injury 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation of numbness and tingling in specific dermatomal distribution along with weakness in grip strength points towards carpal tunnel syndrome which occurs due to compression of median nerve at the level of wrist leading to altered sensation and muscle weakness distal to that region supplied by median nerve.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with secondary amenorrhoea for the past 6 months. She reports a history of heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea since menarche, which was at the age of 12 years. She has been trying to conceive for the past year without success. On examination, there is no evidence of hirsutism or acne, but she has multiple small fibroids on ultrasound scan.
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Asherman's syndrome
B. Endometrial cancer
C. Leiomyosarcoma
D. Adenomyosis
E. Fibroid uterus

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history suggests endometriosis as a possible cause of her symptoms, while the presence of multiple small fibroids on ultrasound makes adenomyosis more likely.

Question
A 24-year-old female athlete presents with primary amenorrhoea and delayed puberty. Her height is below average for her age group, and she has a BMI of 16 kg/m² despite consuming a high-calorie diet due to her training regimen. There are no signs of virilization or other syndromic features on examination.
What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Turner syndrome
B. Kallmann syndrome
C. Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)
D. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
E. Hypothalamic hypogonadism

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The combination of delayed puberty, low BMI, and strenuous exercise suggest hypothalamic hypogonadism as the underlying cause.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with secondary amenorrhoea for six months after having regular periods previously; she denies any recent weight loss or gain or significant stressors in her life over this period? She also complains about hot flushes and night sweats. On examination, there is no evidence of hirsutism or acne.
What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Premature ovarian failure
B. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
C. Hypothalamic hypogonadism
D. Hyperprolactinemia
E. Thyroid dysfunction

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of hot flushes and night sweats suggests a hormonal cause for the patient's symptoms, while the absence of hirsutism or acne makes PCOS less likely. Premature ovarian failure should be considered as a possible cause in this scenario.

Question
A 32-year-old woman with a history of multiple allergies presents to the emergency department after being stung by a bee while gardening. She develops symptoms of anaphylaxis, including difficulty breathing and swelling of the face and throat. Despite receiving adrenaline and other supportive measures, her condition deteriorates rapidly, and she requires intubation.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's refractory anaphylaxis?

A. Delayed administration of adrenaline
B. Inadequate dosing of adrenaline
C. Failure to administer corticosteroids
D. IgE-mediated mast cell activation
E. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell activation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Refractory anaphylaxis can occur when there is persistent or recurrent hypotension despite appropriate treatment with adrenaline and other supportive measures. This may be due to non-IgE-mediated mast cell activation, which can occur in some patients with severe allergic reactions.

Question
A 25-year-old man with a known allergy to peanuts accidentally ingests a small amount of peanut butter while eating at a restaurant. He develops mild symptoms of anaphylaxis, including hives and itching, but does not experience any respiratory distress or hypotension.

Which of the following medications would be most appropriate for treating this patient's mild anaphylactic reaction?

A. Adrenaline IM injection
B. Hydrocortisone IV infusion
C. Chlorphenamine oral tablet
D. Ranitidine IV injection
E. Salbutamol inhaler

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Mild cases of anaphylaxis can often be managed with antihistamines such as chlorphenamine (also known as diphenhydramine). Adrenaline should only be used for moderate to severe cases where there is significant respiratory distress or hypotension.

Question
A 40-year-old woman with a history of multiple allergies presents to the emergency department after being stung by a wasp while hiking. She develops symptoms of anaphylaxis, including difficulty breathing and swelling of the face and throat. She is given adrenaline IM injection and other supportive measures, but her condition continues to deteriorate.

Which of the following would be most appropriate for managing this patient's refractory anaphylaxis?

A. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
B. Plasmapheresis
C. High-dose corticosteroids
D. Methotrexate IV infusion
E. Cyclosporine oral tablet

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Refractory anaphylaxis can be difficult to manage, and may require more aggressive interventions such as plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). These treatments aim to remove or neutralize circulating allergens or antibodies that are contributing to the ongoing allergic reaction.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the neurology clinic with a 6-month history of progressive loss of smell, which has now become complete. He also reports experiencing occasional episodes of dizziness and nausea but denies any headaches or visual disturbances. On examination, he has no nasal obstruction or discharge, and his cranial nerves are otherwise intact.

What is the most likely cause of anosmia in this patient? 

A. Chronic rhinosinusitis
B. Cocaine abuse 
C. Frontotemporal dementia 
D. Idiopathic olfactory dysfunction 
E. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest a progressive onset of anosmia without any associated nasal pathology or drug use, making idiopathic olfactory dysfunction less likely. Chronic rhinosinusitis may cause partial loss of smell but not complete anosmia unless there is an underlying anatomical abnormality such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which can present with unilateral anosmia and other neurological symptoms like dizziness and nausea. However, given the absence of other localizing features on examination, frontotemporal dementia should be considered as a potential diagnosis.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of persistent foul-smelling breath for several months despite good oral hygiene practices. She also reports difficulty tasting food and has lost weight unintentionally over the past few weeks due to decreased appetite.

On examination, she has no obvious dental caries or gingivitis but demonstrates reduced sense of smell on testing using common odors like coffee beans and cinnamon powder.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Anosognosia
B. Atrophic rhinitis
C. Chronic sinusitis
D. Olfactory groove meningioma
E. Tonsilloliths

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests atrophic rhinitis, a rare condition characterized by progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa leading to persistent foul-smelling breath (ozena) and reduced sense of smell (anosmia). Chronic sinusitis may also cause similar symptoms but is more commonly associated with nasal congestion and discharge. Olfactory groove meningioma can present with anosmia but usually has other neurological features like headache or visual disturbances. Tonsilloliths are calcified deposits in the tonsils that may cause bad breath but do not affect olfaction. Anosognosia refers to a lack of awareness or insight into one's own medical condition and is not relevant here.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to the ENT clinic with complaints of sudden onset loss of smell following an upper respiratory tract infection two weeks ago. He reports no history of head trauma, drug use, or exposure to toxic chemicals.

On examination, he demonstrates complete loss of smell on testing using common odors like coffee beans and cinnamon powder. MRI scan shows bilateral hyperintense signals in the olfactory bulbs without any evidence of mass lesions.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute viral rhinosinusitis
B. Alzheimer's disease 
C. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension 
D. Post-infectious olfactory dysfunction 
E. Traumatic brain injury

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests post-infectious olfactory dysfunction, which can occur following viral infections affecting the upper respiratory tract such as acute viral rhinosinusitis. This typically manifests as a sudden onset loss of smell that may be partial or complete and often resolves spontaneously within several months although some cases may persist indefinitely. Alzheimer's disease does not typically present with isolated anosmia as an early symptom while idiopathic intracranial hypertension may cause papilledema and headaches along with visual changes rather than olfactory deficits. Traumatic brain injury may cause anosmia but usually has other neurological features like cognitive impairment or motor deficits.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to her GP with symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks that have been ongoing for the past year. She describes feeling constantly on edge, experiencing palpitations, sweating, and shortness of breath whenever she is in a crowded place or has to speak in public. She also reports having intrusive thoughts about harming herself or others, which cause her significant distress. On further questioning, it becomes apparent that she has a fear of germs and contamination, leading her to avoid touching certain objects or shaking hands with people. Which one of the following medications would be most appropriate as first-line treatment for this patient? 

A. Clonazepam
B. Duloxetine
C. Escitalopram
D. Haloperidol
E. Quetiapine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered first-line pharmacological treatment for anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Escitalopram is an SSRI commonly used in the management of these conditions due to its favorable side effect profile.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to his psychiatrist with symptoms suggestive of OCD, including recurrent intrusive thoughts about causing harm to himself or others and compulsions such as checking locks repeatedly before leaving home or washing his hands excessively throughout the day. He reports that these symptoms have significantly impacted his ability to function at work and maintain relationships with family and friends over the past few years despite trying various treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). What would be the next best step in managing this patient? 

A. Augmenting current medication regimen with an antipsychotic agent 
B. Referring him for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
C. Switching to a different class of antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
D. Recommending deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery
E. Continuing with CBT and optimizing the dose of SSRIs

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In cases where patients do not respond adequately to first-line treatments for OCD, augmentation with an atypical antipsychotic agent such as risperidone or quetiapine may be considered. These agents have been shown to improve symptoms in some patients by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of excessive fear and avoidance of certain situations such as flying, heights, and enclosed spaces that interfere with her daily life. She reports feeling anxious and panicky whenever she is exposed to these triggers, leading her to avoid them altogether or endure them with extreme discomfort. On further questioning, it becomes apparent that she has experienced similar symptoms since childhood but never sought help before due to embarrassment and shame. Which one of the following psychotherapeutic approaches would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Psychodynamic therapy 
B. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)
C. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
D. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)
E. Interpersonal therapy (IPT)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment approach for anxiety disorders such as specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It involves identifying negative thought patterns and beliefs that contribute to anxiety symptoms and replacing them with more adaptive ones through exposure-based techniques like systematic desensitization or flooding coupled with cognitive restructuring exercises.

Question
A 62-year-old man with a history of alcoholic liver disease presents to the emergency department with worsening abdominal distension and shortness of breath. On examination, he has a tense abdomen with shifting dullness and reduced air entry in both lung bases. His vital signs are stable but his oxygen saturation is low at 88% on room air. Chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusions and ultrasound confirms the presence of ascites.
What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. Large volume paracentesis
B. Intravenous albumin infusion
C. Diuretic therapy
D. Antibiotic prophylaxis 
E. Urgent referral for liver transplant evaluation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests that he has developed hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) secondary to his advanced cirrhosis, which carries a high mortality rate if left untreated. Intravenous albumin infusion is the first-line treatment for HRS as it improves renal perfusion and reduces systemic inflammation.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with progressive abdominal distension over several months associated with increasing fatigue and weight loss despite an adequate diet intake. She denies any significant medical or surgical history except for occasional alcohol use on weekends.
On examination, there is marked ascites present causing moderate abdominal discomfort without any tenderness or organomegaly palpable.
Which investigation would be most useful in establishing the underlying cause? 

A. Serum protein electrophoresis 
B. Abdominal CT scan 
C. Serum CA-125 level 
D. Upper GI endoscopy 
E. Ascitic fluid cytology

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In patients presenting with new-onset ascites, diagnostic paracentesis should always be performed to determine whether the fluid is transudative or exudative in nature, as well as to identify potential infectious or malignant causes. Ascitic fluid cytology is particularly useful in patients with suspected malignancy, as it has a high sensitivity for detecting malignant cells.

Question
A 58-year-old man with known alcoholic liver disease presents to the clinic with increasing abdominal distension and discomfort over several weeks. He reports no other symptoms but admits to continued alcohol use despite counselling from his primary care physician.
On examination, there is marked ascites present causing moderate abdominal discomfort without any tenderness or organomegaly palpable. Laboratory investigations reveal a serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) of 10 g/L (normal <11g/L).
What is the most likely cause of this patient's ascites? 

A. Portal hypertension 
B. Malignancy 
C. Nephrotic syndrome 
D. Tuberculosis peritonitis 
E. Heart failure

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The low SAAG value suggests that the underlying cause of this patient's ascites is not related to portal hypertension or cirrhosis, which typically have a high SAAG value (>11 g/L). Other causes of exudative ascites include malignancy, tuberculosis peritonitis, and pancreatitis; however, given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and lack of other clinical features suggestive of these conditions, tuberculosis peritonitis is the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of hearing voices for the past two weeks. He reports that he hears multiple voices, some of which are familiar and others unfamiliar, commenting on his actions and thoughts. The patient also reports feeling paranoid and believes that people are out to get him. Upon further evaluation, it is noted that the patient has a history of substance abuse and has been using methamphetamine for the past six months.

Which one of the following is correct? 

A. Schizophrenia
B. Substance-induced psychotic disorder
C. Bipolar disorder
D. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features
E. Delusional disorder

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder as there is evidence of recent drug use and no prior psychiatric history or family history of mental illness.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of hearing voices for the past month. She reports hearing a voice that sounds like her deceased mother telling her what to do throughout the day. She also reports feeling guilty about not being able to take care of her mother before she passed away due to financial constraints. There is no significant medical or psychiatric history.

Which one of the following is correct? 

A. Second person hallucination
B. Third person hallucination 
C. Command hallucination

On further questioning, she reveals that she has been experiencing recurrent thoughts about harming herself but denies any intent or plans to do so. She also admits to having a history of childhood trauma and abuse.

What is the most appropriate treatment?

A. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
B. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
C. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)
D. Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy (EMDR)
E. Group psychotherapy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of borderline personality disorder (BPD), which is often associated with childhood trauma and self-harm behaviours. DBT is a specialized form of psychotherapy that has been shown to be effective in treating BPD by targeting emotional dysregulation and interpersonal difficulties.

Question
A 10-year-old boy is brought to see a child psychiatrist by his parents, who report that he has been having behavioural problems for several years. They describe him as being very aggressive towards other children and adults, often hitting or biting them when he gets angry. He also has difficulty controlling his emotions, frequently throwing tantrums over seemingly minor issues. The parents have tried various disciplinary measures at home but nothing seems to work.
The child psychiatrist conducts a comprehensive assessment of the boy's behaviour and history. She notes that he was born prematurely at 32 weeks' gestation and spent several weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory distress syndrome. His developmental milestones were delayed, with him not walking until 18 months of age and not speaking until almost 3 years old.
Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this child's behavioural difficulties?

A. Conduct disorder
B. Oppositional defiant disorder
C. Autism spectrum disorder
D. Intellectual disability
E. Fetal alcohol syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The symptoms described in this case are consistent with conduct disorder, which is characterized by persistent patterns of antisocial behavior such as aggression towards people or animals, destruction of property, theft, lying, and violation of rules or laws.

Question
A 7-year-old girl is referred to a pediatrician by her school after teachers raised concerns about her behaviour in class. They report that she is easily distracted and has trouble paying attention during lessons, often daydreaming or fidgeting instead of completing tasks. She also struggles with social interactions, preferring to play alone rather than engaging with other children.
Upon further investigation, the pediatrician learns that the girl was adopted from an orphanage in a developing country when she was 2 years old. She had experienced significant neglect and malnutrition during her early years, which may have contributed to her current behavioural difficulties.
Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this child's symptoms?

A. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
B. Autism spectrum disorder
C. Reactive attachment disorder
D. Intellectual disability
E. Specific learning disorder

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The symptoms described in this case are consistent with reactive attachment disorder, which can occur in children who have experienced significant disruptions in early caregiving relationships such as institutional care or neglect.

Question
A 9-year-old boy is brought to see a child psychologist by his parents, who report that he has been having severe behavioural problems at home and school for several years. They describe him as being highly aggressive towards other people and animals, often hitting or biting them without provocation. He also engages in self-injurious behaviour such as head-banging or scratching himself until he bleeds.
The child psychologist conducts a comprehensive assessment of the boy's behaviour and history. She notes that he was born prematurely at 28 weeks' gestation and spent several months in the neonatal intensive care unit due to multiple medical complications including respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this child's behavioural difficulties?

A. Conduct disorder
B. Oppositional defiant disorder
C. Autism spectrum disorder
D. Intellectual disability
E. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The symptoms described in this case are consistent with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, which is characterized by severe recurrent temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion to the situation or provocation, along with persistent irritability or anger between outbursts. This disorder is often comorbid with other conditions such as ADHD, anxiety disorders, and intellectual disability. The child's history of prematurity and neonatal complications may also contribute to his behavioural difficulties.

Question
A 42-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a painful and swollen left leg after being bitten by an unknown insect while hiking in a forested area.

A. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 
B. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram
C. Blood transfusion 
D. Intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation 
E. Discharge with outpatient follow-up 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient is haemodynamically unstable and requires urgent IV fluid resuscitation to restore intravascular volume and maintain organ perfusion.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with a history of recurrent episodes of melaena over the past year, for which he has been taking iron supplements. He denies any abdominal pain or vomiting but reports feeling fatigued and weak.
On examination, his blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg, pulse rate is 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, and there are no signs of active bleeding.
What investigation should be performed first? 

A. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 
B. Colonoscopy 
C. Capsule endoscopy 
D. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis 
E. Faecal occult blood test 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presence of melaena suggests an upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding; however, it is important to rule out lower gastrointestinal bleeding as well by performing a faecal occult blood test before proceeding with invasive investigations such as endoscopy or colonoscopy.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with heavy vaginal bleeding, two weeks after delivering her first child via caesarean section. She reports that she has been experiencing intermittent spotting since delivery but it has now increased in volume and is associated with clots. Her vital signs are stable and a pelvic examination reveals an enlarged uterus with no obvious source of bleeding from the cervix or vagina.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's postpartum haemorrhage? 

A. Uterine atony
B. Coagulopathy
C. Placenta accreta
D. Cervical laceration
E. Vaginal hematoma

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The history of previous caesarean section increases the risk for placenta accreta, which occurs when the placenta implants too deeply into the uterine wall and can result in significant postpartum hemorrhage.

Question
A 28-year-old G1P0 woman presents to labour ward at term gestation in active labour. After a prolonged second stage of labour, she delivers vaginally without any complications noted during delivery or immediate postpartum period. However, on day three after delivery, she develops sudden onset severe vaginal bleeding associated with abdominal pain and fever.
Which one of the following conditions should be suspected? 

A. Endometritis 
B. Retained products of conception 
C. Uterine rupture 
D. Invasive cervical cancer 
E. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

Correct Answer: A

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of asthma presents to the emergency department with acute onset breathlessness and wheezing. He reports that he has not been taking his inhalers regularly due to financial constraints over the past few months. On examination, he is tachypneic with respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral expiratory wheeze without crackles or rhonchi.

Which one of the following treatments should be initiated first? 

A. Inhaled salbutamol 
B. Intravenous corticosteroids 
C. Oxygen therapy 
D. Nebulized ipratropium bromide 
E. Magnesium sulfate infusion

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation with severe hypoxemia requires immediate initiation of oxygen therapy as the first line treatment before other interventions such as bronchodilators or corticosteroids can be considered.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with multiple bruises on her arms and legs. She reports that she has been experiencing easy bruising for the past few months, without any obvious trauma or injury. On further questioning, she reveals a history of heavy menstrual bleeding and occasional nosebleeds. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which she takes medications regularly.

On examination, there are multiple ecchymoses on both upper and lower limbs. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Which of the following laboratory investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?

A. Platelet aggregation studies
B. Coagulation factor assays
C. Bone marrow biopsy
D. Serum protein electrophoresis
E. Genetic testing for von Willebrand disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of an underlying coagulopathy, given the presence of easy bruising, heavy menstrual bleeding, and occasional nosebleeds. While platelet function tests may help rule out thrombocytopenia as a cause of bleeding, they are unlikely to provide much information in this case since the patient's platelet count is likely to be normal based on her clinical presentation. Similarly, genetic testing for von Willebrand disease may be considered if other diagnostic tests are inconclusive; however, it would not be the first-line investigation in this scenario.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with complaints of recurrent episodes of spontaneous bruising over his arms and legs for the past year. He denies any recent trauma or falls but reports that he occasionally experiences mild epistaxis and gum bleeding while brushing his teeth.

On examination, there are multiple ecchymoses noted over both upper and lower limbs bilaterally. There is no evidence of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?

A. Serum protein electrophoresis
B. Coagulation factor assays
C. Bone marrow biopsy
D. Platelet aggregation studies
E. Genetic testing for inherited thrombocytopenia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of an underlying bleeding disorder, given the presence of recurrent episodes of spontaneous bruising and mild mucosal bleeding. While coagulation factor assays and platelet function tests may help rule out specific causes of bleeding, they are unlikely to provide much information in this case since the patient's clinical presentation is non-specific. Similarly, genetic testing for inherited thrombocytopenia may be considered if other diagnostic tests are inconclusive; however, it would not be the first-line investigation in this scenario.

Question
A 20-year-old woman presents with complaints of multiple bruises over her arms and legs for the past few weeks. She reports that she has been feeling fatigued and weak lately but denies any history of trauma or injury.

On examination, there are multiple ecchymoses noted over both upper and lower limbs bilaterally. There is no evidence of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Which one of the following laboratory investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?

A. Complete blood count with differential
B. Serum ferritin levels
C. Vitamin B12 levels
D. Thyroid function tests
E. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of an underlying hematological disorder, given the presence of fatigue and weakness along with easy bruising without any obvious cause or injury. A complete blood count with differential can help identify abnormalities such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or pancytopenia which could point towards a specific diagnosis. While serum ferritin levels, vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function tests, and ESR may be useful in ruling out other causes of fatigue and weakness, they are unlikely to provide much information regarding the patient's bruising.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with extensive burns following a house fire. The patient has sustained full-thickness burns to his chest, abdomen, and both arms. He is intubated and ventilated due to inhalation injury. His urine output is low despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, and he develops acute kidney injury.
Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)
B. Haemodialysis
C. Peritoneal dialysis
D. Renal biopsy
E. Conservative management

Correct Answer: A

What is the risk of this patient having a child with Down syndrome? 

A. 1 in 100
B. 1 in 250
C. 1 in 500
D. 1 in 750
E. 1 in 1000

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The risk of Down syndrome is increased with maternal age and the use of ART, but also increases if there is a family history of the condition. In this case, the patient’s sister had a child with Down syndrome, which increases her risk to approximately 1 in 250 pregnancies.

Question
A 72-year-old woman presents to her GP with a 6-month history of constipation, abdominal pain and bloating. She reports that she has tried increasing her fluid intake and dietary fibre but without any improvement in symptoms. On examination, there is an abdominal mass palpable on deep palpation. Blood tests reveal elevated CA-125 levels.

Which one of the following is correct?

A. Chronic idiopathic constipation
B. Colorectal cancer
C. Diverticular disease
D. Ovarian cancer
E. Simple constipation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation is suggestive of ovarian cancer as it commonly causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, abdominal pain and bloating due to tumour growth or metastasis to the bowel. Elevated CA-125 levels are also indicative of ovarian cancer.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with a 1-month history of constipation, rectal bleeding and weight loss. He has no family history of malignancy and initial blood tests are normal except for low haemoglobin levels.

Which one of the following is correct?

A. Chronic idiopathic constipation
B. Colorectal cancer
C. Diverticular disease
D. Irritable bowel syndrome
E. Simple constipation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is concerning for colorectal cancer given the presence of rectal bleeding, weight loss and low haemoglobin levels which may indicate anaemia from chronic blood loss.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to her GP with a long-standing history of constipation since childhood despite adequate dietary fibre intake and hydration status.
On examination, there is evidence of anal fissures and haemorrhoids.

Which one of the following is correct? 

A. Improve dietary fluid and fibre 
B. Stool softeners (lactulose or docusate) 
C. Manual evacuation under general anaesthetic
D. Enema
E. Stimulant laxatives

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of anal fissures and haemorrhoids suggests that the patient may be straining during defecation which can worsen constipation. Stool softeners such as lactulose or docusate can help to soften the stool and make it easier to pass, reducing the need for straining.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the GP for contraception advice. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which were diagnosed during her last pregnancy, and she is currently on warfarin therapy. She is in a stable relationship with her partner and wants to start using contraception again. Her medical history includes hypertension, which is well controlled with lisinopril.

Which of the following contraceptive methods would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Combined oral contraceptive pill
B. Progesterone-only pill
C. Copper intrauterine device
D. Hormonal intrauterine system
E. Condoms

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The use of combined hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated in women with a history of DVT or PE due to an increased risk of recurrence. Progesterone-only pills are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared to non-users but may be considered in some cases where other options are not suitable or acceptable to the patient. Copper IUDs do not contain hormones and can be used safely by women who have had a previous DVT/PE while taking anticoagulants such as warfarin; however, they may cause heavier periods which could exacerbate anaemia if present. Hormonal intrauterine systems release progestogen locally into the uterus and have been shown to be safe in women at high risk of VTE, including those taking anticoagulants.

Question
A 19-year-old female university student attends the sexual health clinic requesting emergency contraception after having unprotected sex with her boyfriend last night. She reports that her last menstrual period was two weeks ago and that her cycles are usually regular.

Which of the following options would be most appropriate? 

A. Levonorgestrel 1.5mg single dose
B. Ulipristal acetate 30mg single dose
C. Combined oral contraceptive pill taken as per instructions for emergency contraception 
D. Copper intrauterine device insertion within 5 days of unprotected sex
E. No intervention required

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate are both effective options for emergency contraception, but ulipristal acetate is more effective than levonorgestrel when used up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. The combined oral contraceptive pill can also be used as an emergency contraceptive, but it requires taking multiple pills over a period of time which may not be practical or acceptable to the patient in this scenario. A copper IUD can be inserted up to five days after unprotected sex and provides ongoing contraception if desired; however, it requires a visit to a healthcare provider and may not be suitable for all women.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with a request for contraception advice following the birth of her second child six weeks ago via caesarean section. She is currently breastfeeding exclusively and has not yet had a menstrual period since giving birth.

Which of the following would be the most appropriate method of contraception? 

A. Combined hormonal contraceptives
B. Progesterone-only pill
C. Copper intrauterine device
D. Hormonal intrauterine system
E. Barrier methods (condoms/diaphragm)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Women who are breastfeeding should avoid using combined hormonal contraceptives until at least six months postpartum due to concerns about potential effects on milk production and infant growth; however, progesterone-only pills can be used safely during lactation if needed for contraception. Copper IUDs are highly effective and do not contain hormones that could affect breast milk composition or quantity, making them a good option for breastfeeding women. Hormonal intrauterine systems release progestogen locally into the uterus and are also safe for use during lactation, but may cause irregular bleeding which could be confusing or distressing for some women. Barrier methods can be used as a temporary measure until more effective contraception is established, but they require consistent and correct use to be effective.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a persistent cough that has been ongoing for several months. He reports occasional episodes of hemoptysis and weight loss over the past few weeks. The patient is an ex-smoker, having quit smoking 10 years ago after smoking for 30 years. On examination, there are no focal chest signs, but there is dullness on percussion at the right base.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
B. Bronchiectasis
C. Lung cancer
D. Pulmonary fibrosis
E. Tuberculosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The history of persistent cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, and previous smoking history raises suspicion for lung cancer.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Intussusception
B. Hirschsprung disease
C. Meckel diverticulum
D. Pyloric stenosis
E. Malrotation with midgut volvulus

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests malrotation with midgut volvulus as the most likely diagnosis given the presence of an abdominal mass and symptoms consistent with intestinal obstruction.

Question
A mother brings her 2-week-old infant son to see you at your clinic because he has been crying excessively since birth, particularly after feeding sessions. She reports that he arches his back and appears uncomfortable during feeds, sometimes spitting up milk afterwards. The infant was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery at term without complications and has gained weight appropriately since birth. On examination, there are no abnormalities detected except for mild gastro-oesophageal reflux noted on auscultation.
What would be your next step? 

A. Prescribe ranitidine 
B. Order an upper gastrointestinal series 
C. Recommend frequent burping during feedings 
D. Advise switching to formula milk 
E. Refer to paediatric gastroenterology specialist 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Frequent burping during feedings can help alleviate symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants. Medications are generally not recommended for mild cases, and further investigations such as an upper gastrointestinal series or referral to a specialist may be considered if symptoms persist.

Question
A 4-month-old baby girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents with a history of excessive crying and irritability for the past week. The parents report that their daughter cries inconsolably, especially in the evenings, and has difficulty sleeping. They also noticed that she pulls up her legs towards her chest during these episodes. There are no signs of fever or vomiting, and the child's growth parameters are within normal limits. On examination, there is no abdominal distension or tenderness.
What would be your initial management? 

A. Prescribe simethicone drops 
B. Order stool tests 
C. Recommend switching to formula milk 
D. Refer to paediatric gastroenterology specialist 
E. Reassure and provide support 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Infantile colic is a common condition characterized by excessive crying in otherwise healthy infants without any identifiable cause or underlying medical condition. Management involves reassurance and support for parents as well as providing advice on coping strategies such as swaddling, rocking, or using white noise machines.

Question
A 2-month-old baby boy is brought to the hospital by his parents who are concerned about their child's bluish skin and lips. The baby was born at term via normal vaginal delivery, following an uneventful pregnancy. On examination, there is a loud systolic murmur heard over the precordium with a palpable thrill. An echocardiogram reveals that the patient has pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS). 

Which of the following statements regarding PA/IVS is true? 

A. It is associated with a left-to-right shunt.
B. It presents with cyanosis from birth.
C. Echocardiography shows increased pulmonary blood flow.
D. Treatment involves surgical closure of the patent ductus arteriosus.
E. It can be managed conservatively without surgery.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS) is characterized by complete obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract, resulting in absent or severely hypoplastic pulmonary arteries and no direct communication between the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation. This leads to cyanosis from birth due to decreased oxygen saturation in systemic venous blood returning to the heart through persistent fetal channels such as foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus.

Question
A 4-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with complaints of fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and recurrent episodes of bluish discoloration of her fingers and toes during cold weather or emotional stress since early childhood. She was born at term via normal vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy but had frequent respiratory infections during infancy and required hospitalization for pneumonia twice before age 3 years old.

On examination, she appears pale and has clubbing of her fingers and toes bilaterally. Her arterial oxygen saturation is 85% at rest and drops to 70% during a 6-minute walk test. A chest X-ray shows enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and right ventricular hypertrophy.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Tetralogy of Fallot
B. Transposition of the great arteries
C. Pulmonary hypertension
D. Eisenmenger syndrome
E. Patent ductus arteriosus

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical features are consistent with Eisenmenger syndrome, which occurs when a congenital heart defect that causes left-to-right shunting (such as ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus) leads to irreversible pulmonary vascular disease due to chronic exposure to increased blood flow and pressure in the lungs. This results in reversal of the shunt direction, causing cyanosis and clubbing due to decreased oxygen saturation in systemic arterial blood.

Question
A 1-month-old baby girl is brought to the hospital by her parents who noticed bluish discoloration of her skin since birth, especially during feeding or crying episodes. She was born prematurely at 32 weeks via emergency caesarean section for fetal distress after an uneventful pregnancy but required mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome for 2 weeks after birth.

On examination, she appears small for gestational age with poor weight gain despite adequate caloric intake from formula feeds. Her arterial oxygen saturation is 80% on room air and increases to 90% with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannulae.

Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? 

A. Persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn (PPHN)
B. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)
C. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
D. Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF)
E. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn (PPHN) is a life-threatening condition characterized by persistent elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance and right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus or foramen ovale, leading to hypoxemia and cyanosis. It can be caused by various factors such as meconium aspiration syndrome, sepsis, congenital heart disease, or prematurity with respiratory distress syndrome. In this case, the patient's history of premature birth and respiratory distress syndrome suggests PPHN as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with recurrent epistaxis for the past month. He has a history of hypertension, and his medications include aspirin and clopidogrel. On examination, there is no obvious bleeding source in either nostril, but he has telangiectasias on his nasal mucosa.

Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate?

A. CT angiography
B. Nasal endoscopy
C. Platelet function assay
D. Coagulation profile
E. Bone marrow biopsy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Given the patient's age, medical history, and medication use, it is important to rule out any underlying pathology that may be contributing to his recurrent epistaxis. While CT angiography can identify vascular abnormalities or tumors, it may not provide enough detail to visualize small lesions on the nasal mucosa. A platelet function assay may also be useful in assessing potential bleeding disorders related to antiplatelet therapy; however, this patient's presentation suggests a local cause of bleeding rather than a systemic disorder affecting platelets. A coagulation profile could help identify clotting factor deficiencies or other hematologic conditions that predispose to bleeding; however, given the lack of obvious bleeding sources on exam, this investigation may not yield significant findings. Therefore, nasal endoscopy is likely the best initial investigation as it allows direct visualization of the nasal cavity and identification of any structural or mucosal abnormalities that may be causing recurrent epistaxis.

Question
A 42-year-old woman presents with a 2-day history of persistent epistaxis from her right nostril despite attempts at compression and cauterization by her GP. She reports feeling generally unwell with fatigue and joint pain over the past few weeks.

On examination, she appears pale and has petechiae on her arms and legs bilaterally.

Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate?

A. CT angiography
B. Nasal endoscopy
C. Complete blood count with differential
D. Coagulation profile
E. Liver function tests

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is concerning for a bleeding disorder, such as thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, given her persistent epistaxis and petechiae on exam. A complete blood count with differential can help identify any abnormalities in platelet count or morphology that may be contributing to the bleeding, as well as assess for potential leukemic or lymphoproliferative disorders that can cause mucosal bleeding. While nasal endoscopy may reveal an obvious source of bleeding, it is important to rule out systemic causes before proceeding with local interventions such as cauterization or packing. CT angiography may be useful if there is suspicion of a vascular abnormality causing the epistaxis; however, this investigation does not address the underlying hematologic issue.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of recurrent episodes of unilateral epistaxis over the past year. He reports no other symptoms and has no significant medical history.

On examination, there are no visible abnormalities in either nostril, but he has telangiectasias on his nasal septum.

Which of the following management options would be most appropriate?

A. Observation only
B. Topical corticosteroids
C. Antifibrinolytic therapy
D. Endoscopic laser treatment
E. Surgical excision of telangiectasias

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests idiopathic posterior epistaxis due to telangiectasias on his nasal septum which are not visible on anterior rhinoscopy alone; therefore, further imaging or endoscopic evaluation may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis and guide management decisions (such as CT angiography or nasal endoscopy). While observation alone may be appropriate for mild or infrequent episodes of epistaxis, this patient's recurrent bleeding suggests a need for intervention. Topical corticosteroids and antifibrinolytic therapy are not typically effective in treating posterior epistaxis due to telangiectasias. Endoscopic laser treatment is a minimally invasive option that can effectively target the source of bleeding; however, it requires specialized equipment and expertise. Surgical excision of the telangiectasias is likely the most definitive management option in this case, as it directly addresses the underlying pathology causing the recurrent epistaxis.

Question

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: An EEG should be performed in patients presenting with new-onset or worsening seizures, especially if there is concern for medication noncompliance or drug toxicity. MRI brain scans are more useful in identifying structural abnormalities that may be causing seizures, while lumbar puncture is indicated if there is suspicion of an underlying infection such as meningitis. Blood glucose and electrolyte levels should also be checked to rule out metabolic causes of seizures.

Question
A 28-year-old man with a history of epilepsy presents to the emergency department after experiencing a generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting approximately two minutes. He has no known triggers for his seizures and reports being compliant with his antiepileptic medication (levetiracetam). On examination, he is noted to have mild confusion but no other focal neurological deficits. His blood tests are significant for hypoglycemia (glucose level 2.8 mmol/L).

Which one of the following would be most appropriate as initial management? 

A. IV lorazepam 
B. IV phenytoin
C. Oral diazepam 
D. Dextrose infusion 
E. Sodium bicarbonate infusion

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Hypoglycemia can cause seizures and must be treated promptly with dextrose infusion to prevent further episodes and potential brain damage from prolonged hypoglycemia-induced seizures. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam are used for acute seizure management but are not indicated in this case since the patient's seizure has already terminated by the time he presents to the hospital. Phenytoin is typically reserved for refractory status epilepticus and may not be necessary in this case given that the patient's seizure has resolved spontaneously without intervention. Sodium bicarbonate infusion is not indicated unless there is evidence of metabolic acidosis on arterial blood gas analysis, which was not provided in this scenario.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP with concerns about her husband's behavior. He has become increasingly paranoid and believes that their neighbors are spying on them through hidden cameras in the house.

B. Dry age-related macular degeneration 
C. Central serous chorioretinopathy
D. Optic neuritis 
E. Retinitis pigmentosa

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of bilateral painless visual decline affecting central vision with subretinal fluid and drusen deposits on fundoscopy is consistent with wet AMD, which is characterized by neovascularization leading to leakage of blood and fluid into the retina causing rapid deterioration of vision if left untreated.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to the clinic with bilateral breast enlargement that has been present for several years. He reports no pain or discharge from his nipples, but is concerned about the cosmetic appearance of his chest. On examination, there is firm glandular tissue palpable behind both nipples and no other abnormalities are noted.
Which of the following conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis?

A. Klinefelter syndrome
B. Testicular cancer
C. Hyperthyroidism
D. Liver cirrhosis
E. Idiopathic gynaecomastia

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The most common cause of gynaecomastia in males is idiopathic, accounting for up to 75% of cases. However, it is important to consider other causes such as hormonal imbalances (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome), testicular cancer, liver disease, and certain medications (e.g., spironolactone). 

Question
A 16-year-old boy presents with unilateral breast enlargement that has been present for several months. He reports tenderness and discomfort in the affected breast and denies any nipple discharge or trauma to the area.
What is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?

A. Breast cancer
B. Fibroadenoma
C. Inflammatory breast disease
D. Gynaecomastia due to puberty 
E. Male breast abscess

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Unilateral breast enlargement in adolescent males is usually due to benign physiological changes during puberty known as pubertal gynaecomastia which typically resolves within two years without treatment unless it persists beyond this time frame or becomes symptomatic requiring medical attention.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with bilateral breast enlargement that has been present for several years. He reports no pain or discharge from his nipples, but is concerned about the cosmetic appearance of his chest. On examination, there is firm glandular tissue palpable behind both nipples and no other abnormalities are noted.
Which of the following medications should be considered as a possible cause?

A. Metformin
B. Atorvastatin
C. Omeprazole
D. Finasteride
E. Ramipril

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Medications such as finasteride (used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia) have been associated with gynaecomastia in some patients due to its anti-androgenic effects which can lead to an imbalance between estrogen and testosterone levels causing breast tissue growth in males. 

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of gross haematuria and severe abdominal pain. She has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and recurrent urinary tract infections. On examination, her blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, and she appears pale and diaphoretic. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the left flank region. Blood tests reveal elevated creatinine levels (230 μmol/L) and low haemoglobin levels (8 g/dL). Urine dipstick test shows large amounts of blood with no proteinuria or leukocyturia.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? 

A. Acute pyelonephritis
B. Renal cell carcinoma
C. Glomerulonephritis
D. Bladder stones 
E. Renal artery embolism

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presentation is consistent with renal artery embolism as it typically presents with sudden onset of flank pain, hematuria, and decreased kidney function due to obstruction of arterial flow to the affected kidney. The presence of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk for vascular disease such as renal artery embolism.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with persistent microscopic haematuria on routine urine dipstick testing over the past year without any other associated symptoms or medical conditions. He has a history of smoking for over 40 years but quit smoking six months ago after being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Physical examination is unremarkable except for mild obesity (BMI = 32 kg/m²). Investigations reveal normal serum creatinine levels, negative ANCA antibodies, normal complement C3/C4 levels, negative dsDNA antibodies, and a normal chest X-ray.
What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. CT urogram
B. Cystoscopy 
C. Renal biopsy
D. Urine cytology 
E. Repeat urine dipstick testing in 6 months

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's risk factors for urologic malignancy (age, male sex, smoking history) and persistent microscopic haematuria warrant further investigation with a CT urogram to evaluate the upper urinary tract and bladder.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of visible haematuria over the past year associated with mild lower abdominal pain during menstruation. She has no significant medical history and is not taking any medications or supplements. Physical examination is unremarkable except for mild tenderness on palpation of the suprapubic region during menses. Blood tests reveal normal serum creatinine levels, negative ANCA antibodies, normal complement C3/C4 levels, negative dsDNA antibodies, and a normal pelvic ultrasound.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? 

A. Endometriosis
B. Interstitial cystitis
C. Glomerulonephritis
D. Bladder cancer 
E. Nephrolithiasis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of cyclic haematuria associated with menstrual pain suggests endometriosis involving the bladder or ureters as a possible cause of haematuria in this patient without other significant medical conditions or risk factors for urologic malignancy. Further evaluation with MRI or laparoscopy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and management planning.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of haemoptysis and chest pain. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for which she was on anticoagulation therapy until 3 months ago when she stopped taking her medication due to financial constraints. On examination, she is tachycardic and hypotensive. There are bilateral crepitations heard in both lung fields. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) reveals multiple filling defects in the main pulmonary artery and its branches.
What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Thrombolysis
B. Anticoagulation therapy
C. Surgical embolectomy
D. Inferior vena cava filter placement
E. Observation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient has acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention. The options for treatment include systemic thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, or catheter-directed therapies such as mechanical thrombectomy or catheter-based fibrinolysis.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with recurrent episodes of haemoptysis over the last year associated with weight loss and night sweats. He has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heavy smoking for more than 40 years before quitting 5 years ago. On examination, he has decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe with dullness to percussion and clubbing of fingers.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Tuberculosis
B. Lung cancer
C. Bronchiectasis 
D. Pulmonary fibrosis 
E. Aspergillosis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's symptoms are suggestive of lung cancer, especially given his significant smoking history and persistent haemoptysis despite cessation of smoking. The presence of clubbing and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe suggests a possible malignancy.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of haemoptysis over the last month associated with cough, fever, and fatigue. She has no significant past medical history and does not smoke. On examination, she is tachypnoeic with bilateral crepitations heard in both lung fields. Chest X-ray shows diffuse infiltrates throughout both lung fields.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pneumonia
B. Pulmonary embolism 
C. Wegener's granulomatosis 
D. Goodpasture syndrome 
E. Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's symptoms are suggestive of an autoimmune disease such as Wegener's granulomatosis, which can present with haemoptysis, cough, fever, and diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray. Other potential causes of haemoptysis such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism should also be considered but may have different clinical presentations or imaging findings compared to this case.

Question
A 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being involved in a high-speed car accident. He was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the vehicle, landing on his head. On arrival, he is unresponsive with fixed dilated pupils. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 3. CT scan of the head shows diffuse cerebral oedema.

What is the most likely cause of his current condition?

A. Extradural haematoma
B. Acute subdural haematoma
C. Diffuse axonal injury
D. Intracerebral haemorrhage
E. Traumatic brainstem injury

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's history of high-speed car accident with ejection and subsequent unresponsiveness with fixed dilated pupils suggest severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The CT scan showing diffuse cerebral oedema points towards diffuse axonal injury (DAI), which occurs due to shearing forces that disrupt white matter tracts throughout the brain.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after falling down a flight of stairs at home and hitting her head on multiple steps during descent. She has no loss of consciousness but complains of headache, nausea, and dizziness since then. Her neurological examination reveals mild confusion, left-sided weakness, and papilledema on fundoscopy.

What is the most likely diagnosis based on this presentation?

A. Epidural haematoma
B. Subdural haematoma
C. Cerebral contusion
D. Traumatic intracranial aneurysm rupture
E. Post-traumatic hydrocephalus

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's history suggests TBI resulting from blunt force trauma to the head caused by falling down stairs and hitting her head multiple times during descent, leading to subdural haematoma (SDH). The presence of papilledema on fundoscopy indicates raised intracranial pressure due to SDH.

Question
A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being hit in the head with a baseball bat during a mugging attempt. He was initially unconscious but regained consciousness before arrival at the hospital. On examination, he has a large scalp laceration overlying the right parietal region and no other significant findings. CT scan of the head shows an acute subdural haematoma with midline shift.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient?

A. Observation only
B. Immediate surgical evacuation of haematoma
C. Medical management with anticoagulants
D. Serial imaging every 6 hours
E. Steroid therapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's history and CT findings suggest acute subdural haematoma (ASDH) with midline shift, which requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent further neurological deterioration or death. Observation alone or medical management with anticoagulants are not appropriate options for ASDH, and serial imaging may delay necessary intervention. Steroid therapy has no role in managing ASDH and can be harmful in TBI patients by increasing infection risk and delaying wound healing.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a severe headache that started suddenly while he was at work. He describes it as the worst headache of his life and rates it as 10/10 in severity. The pain is located behind his left eye and radiates to the back of his head. He also reports nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. On examination, his blood pressure is elevated at 180/110 mmHg, heart rate is 100 beats per minute, and temperature is normal. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits but there are bilateral papilledema and neck stiffness.

Which of the following investigations should be performed first? 

A. Non-contrast CT scan of the head
B. Lumbar puncture
C. MRI of the brain
D. Carotid Doppler ultrasound
E. Echocardiogram

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation raises concern for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to sudden onset severe headache associated with nausea/vomiting, photophobia/phonophobia, neck stiffness, and papilledema on fundoscopy which indicates raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Although non-contrast CT scan has high sensitivity for detecting SAH within the first few hours after symptom onset, lumbar puncture remains the gold standard investigation when initial imaging is negative or equivocal because it can detect even small amounts of blood in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Question
A 27-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of recurrent headaches over several months that have been increasing in frequency and intensity recently despite taking paracetamol regularly without much relief. She describes them as throbbing pain on one side of her head accompanied by nausea/vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. The headaches usually last for several hours up to a day and are preceded by visual aura consisting of flashing lights or zigzag lines. She has no significant past medical history but her mother also suffers from similar headaches.

What is the most appropriate first-line prophylactic treatment? 

A. Amitriptyline
B. Topiramate
C. Propranolol
D. Sodium valproate
E. Verapamil

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with migraine headache, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of unilateral throbbing pain associated with nausea/vomiting, photophobia/phonophobia, and often preceded by visual or other sensory aura in some patients. First-line prophylactic treatment options include beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline), antiepileptic drugs (e.g., topiramate, sodium valproate), calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil), or botulinum toxin injections depending on individual patient factors such as comorbidities, side effect profile, and response to previous treatments.

Question
A 62-year-old male presents to his general practitioner complaining of persistent dull headache that he describes as pressure-like sensation across his forehead and temples for the past few months without any specific triggers or relieving factors. He denies any focal neurological symptoms or signs but reports occasional dizziness and ringing in his ears especially when standing up quickly from sitting position. His past medical history includes hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease for which he takes multiple medications including aspirin.

Which of the following investigations should be performed? 

A. Non-contrast CT scan of the head
B. MRI of the brain
C. Carotid Doppler ultrasound
D. Electroencephalogram (EEG)
E. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient's presentation raises concern for secondary causes of headache such as medication overuse, hypertension, or orthostatic hypotension due to his multiple comorbidities and medications. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a useful investigation in patients with suspected hypertension-related headaches because it can detect fluctuations in blood pressure throughout the day and night that may not be apparent on office measurements alone. Other investigations such as non-contrast CT scan or MRI of the brain are unlikely to reveal any significant pathology given the chronicity and nonspecific nature of this patient's symptoms.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the ENT clinic with a complaint of hearing loss in both ears for the past year. He reports that he has difficulty understanding conversations, especially in noisy environments. The patient denies any history of ear infections or trauma and has no family history of hearing loss. Otoscopy reveals normal external auditory canals and tympanic membranes bilaterally. Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, worse at higher frequencies.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's hearing loss? 

A. Presbycusis
B. Meniere's disease
C. Acoustic neuroma
D. Ototoxicity from chemotherapy
E. Autoimmune inner ear disease

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presentation is consistent with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, which is commonly seen in presbycusis; however, given the rapid onset and absence of risk factors such as noise exposure or ototoxic medications, autoimmune inner ear disease should be considered as a possible cause.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of sudden-onset right-sided hearing loss associated with tinnitus and vertigo that started two days ago. She reports feeling unsteady on her feet and has vomited twice since the onset of symptoms but denies any headache or focal neurological deficits.
What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Start empiric antibiotics 
B. Order an urgent MRI scan 
C. Refer to audiology for audiometry testing 
D. Administer intravenous steroids 
E. Perform a lumbar puncture 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical picture suggests acute vestibular syndrome secondary to either labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis, which requires urgent imaging (preferably MRI) to rule out central causes such as stroke.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of progressive left-sided hearing loss over several months accompanied by tinnitus and occasional vertigo. The patient reports a history of noise exposure from working in construction but denies any otalgia, otorrhoea, or ear infections.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Otosclerosis
B. Meniere's disease
C. Acoustic neuroma
D. Noise-induced hearing loss 
E. Presbycusis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Given the history of noise exposure and symptoms consistent with sensorineural hearing loss, noise-induced hearing loss should be considered as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. On examination, a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur is heard at the right upper sternal border that radiates to the carotids. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. An electrocardiogram shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? 

A. Mitral valve prolapse
B. Aortic regurgitation
C. Mitral stenosis
D. Pulmonary stenosis 
E. Tricuspid regurgitation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests acute aortic regurgitation (AR) due to infective endocarditis or aortic dissection in an older male with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. The classic physical finding of AR is a high-pitched decrescendo diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border that may radiate to the apex or along the left sternal border; however, in acute severe AR, there may be an early diastolic murmur followed by a mid-diastolic rumble due to increased flow across the mitral valve during ventricular filling.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with palpitations and fatigue for several weeks. She reports no chest pain or shortness of breath but feels lightheaded when standing up quickly from sitting position. On examination, there is an irregularly irregular rhythm with no murmurs on auscultation but jugular venous distension is noted.

What would be your next step? 

A. Administer intravenous adenosine 
B. Perform transesophageal echocardiography 
C. Order a 24-hour Holter monitor 
D. Prescribe beta-blockers 
E. Refer for electrophysiology study 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia in adults, which may present with palpitations, fatigue, lightheadedness, or syncope due to loss of effective atrial contraction and irregular ventricular response. A 12-lead electrocardiogram should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and assess for underlying structural heart disease or electrolyte abnormalities. A 24-hour Holter monitor is indicated to evaluate the frequency, duration, and pattern of AF episodes as well as associated symptoms and potential triggers.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents with chest pain that started suddenly while playing basketball. He describes it as a sharp stabbing pain that worsens with deep breaths or coughing but improves when he leans forward. On examination, there is a high-pitched scratching sound heard best at the left lower sternal border during systole and diastole.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute myocardial infarction
B. Pericarditis
C. Pulmonary embolism
D. Aortic dissection 
E. Mitral valve prolapse

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests acute pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium surrounding the heart that can cause chest pain, dyspnea, fever, malaise, and friction rub on auscultation due to rubbing between inflamed layers of pericardium during cardiac cycle. The pain is typically pleuritic in nature and relieved by sitting up or leaning forward; however, it may also radiate to the neck, shoulders, back or arms mimicking other conditions such as acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolism. An electrocardiogram may show diffuse ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression in all leads except aVR, which is characteristic of pericarditis.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with a complaint of hoarseness and voice change for the past 6 months. She has also noticed difficulty in swallowing solid food and occasional coughing while eating. The patient denies any history of smoking or alcohol consumption but reports that she works as a teacher, which requires her to speak loudly for long periods.

On examination, there is no palpable neck lymphadenopathy or thyroid enlargement. Flexible nasolaryngoscopy reveals a mass lesion involving the left vocal cord.

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Referral to an ENT surgeon for biopsy
B. CT scan of the chest and abdomen
C. MRI of the head and neck
D. PET-CT scan
E. Referral to a speech therapist

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of a mass lesion involving the vocal cords raises suspicion for laryngeal cancer, especially in patients with risk factors such as prolonged hoarseness, dysphagia, and occupational exposure to irritants like teachers who use their voice excessively. Biopsy is necessary for confirmation of diagnosis and further management.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a complaint of hoarse voice that started suddenly after he had been shouting at his son during a football match two days ago. He has no other symptoms and denies any history of smoking or alcohol consumption.

On examination, there are no palpable neck lymph nodes or masses, but flexible nasolaryngoscopy shows evidence of left-sided vocal cord paresis.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's hoarseness? 

A. Laryngeal trauma 
B. Vocal cord nodules 
C. Laryngeal papillomatosis 
D. Laryngeal carcinoma 
E. Neurological disorder

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Sudden onset unilateral vocal cord paresis is most commonly caused by a neurological disorder, such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or stroke. Laryngeal trauma can also cause hoarseness but usually presents with bilateral vocal cord dysfunction. Vocal cord nodules and papillomatosis are chronic conditions that present with gradual onset of hoarseness.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his GP with a complaint of progressive hoarseness for the past year. He has no other symptoms and denies any history of smoking or alcohol consumption. His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

On examination, there are no palpable neck lymph nodes or masses, but flexible nasolaryngoscopy reveals diffuse thickening of both vocal cords.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Laryngeal cancer 
B. Vocal cord polyps 
C. Reinke's edema 
D. Granulomatous disease 
E. Hypothyroidism

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Diffuse thickening of both vocal cords suggests Reinke's edema, which is a benign condition associated with long-term exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Laryngeal cancer typically presents with unilateral involvement and focal lesions on imaging studies. Vocal cord polyps are localized growths that may require surgical removal. Granulomatous diseases like sarcoidosis can also cause hoarseness but usually involve multiple organ systems. Hypothyroidism can cause voice changes due to decreased thyroid hormone levels affecting the larynx muscles' function but typically presents with other systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight gain.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents to her general practitioner (GP) with a history of loss of libido for the past year. She reports that she has always had a low sex drive, but it has become worse over time. She is currently in a stable relationship and feels guilty about not being able to satisfy her partner's sexual needs. On further questioning, she denies any history of trauma, depression or anxiety. Her menstrual cycles are regular and she does not have any other medical problems.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms? 

A. Hypothyroidism
B. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
C. Hyperprolactinemia
D. Premature ovarian failure
E. Androgen insensitivity syndrome

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's age and regular menstrual cycles make PCOS unlikely as a cause of her symptoms. Hyperprolactinemia can cause loss of libido, but it usually presents with other symptoms such as galactorrhea and irregular periods which are absent in this case. Hypothyroidism can also cause loss of libido, but there are no other clinical features suggestive of thyroid dysfunction in this case. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects females who have XY chromosomes instead of XX chromosomes; however, it typically presents with primary amenorrhea rather than loss of libido.

Premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as premature menopause, is defined as cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40 years leading to decreased estrogen levels which may result in reduced sexual desire among other things.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of decreased libido for the past six months along with difficulty maintaining an erection during intercourse despite having normal morning erections and no significant stressors at work or home.
 
On examination, he appears anxious but otherwise healthy. His blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate are within normal limits. He has no significant past medical history or family history of note.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms? 

A. Hypogonadism
B. Hyperthyroidism
C. Depression
D. Peyronie's disease
E. Multiple sclerosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's age, normal morning erections and lack of stressors make depression an unlikely cause for his symptoms. Peyronie's disease is a condition where scar tissue forms inside the penis leading to curvature during erection; it can cause pain but not loss of libido or difficulty maintaining an erection. Hyperthyroidism can also lead to decreased libido, but there are no other clinical features suggestive of thyroid dysfunction in this case.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system; it can cause sexual dysfunction among other things but typically presents with other neurological symptoms which are absent in this case.

Hypogonadism refers to a deficiency in testosterone production which can result from primary testicular failure or secondary to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction and may present with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and fatigue.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of low sex drive for the past year along with occasional hot flashes and night sweats despite being on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for hypogonadism diagnosed two years ago.
 
On examination, he appears anxious but otherwise healthy. His blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate are within normal limits. He has no significant past medical history except for hypertension controlled on medication.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms? 

A. Testosterone resistance syndrome
B. Klinefelter syndrome
C. Adrenal insufficiency
D. Prostate cancer
E. Opioid-induced hypogonadism

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Testosterone resistance syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome are genetic disorders that affect testosterone production; however, they typically present earlier in life with other clinical features such as gynecomastia or small testes. Adrenal insufficiency can cause decreased libido but is unlikely given the patient's normal blood pressure and lack of other symptoms.

Prostate cancer can also lead to decreased libido, but it typically presents with urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency and nocturia which are absent in this case.

Opioid-induced hypogonadism is a well-known complication of long-term opioid use and may result in decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and fatigue despite being on HRT for hypogonadism.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with a complaint of sudden, painless loss of vision in his right eye. On examination, the red reflex is absent in the affected eye and there is a grey haze obscuring the retina. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but denies any other medical problems or recent trauma. Which one of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? 

A. Retinal artery occlusion
B. Retinal vein occlusion
C. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
D. Optic neuritis 
E. Vitreous detachment

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The sudden onset of painless visual loss, absence of red reflex, and grey haze on fundoscopy are all suggestive of vitreous hemorrhage secondary to retinal artery occlusion (RAO). RAO occurs when an embolus lodges in the central retinal artery or its branches, leading to ischemia and infarction of the inner layers of the retina.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her ophthalmologist complaining of floaters and blurred vision in her left eye that has been worsening over several weeks. On examination, there is no red reflex present in the affected eye and she has multiple cotton wool spots scattered throughout the retina along with areas of neovascularization at the optic disc. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Diabetic retinopathy 
B. Central serous chorioretinopathy 
C. Age-related macular degeneration 
D. Hypertensive retinopathy 
E. Sickle cell retinopathy 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presence of cotton wool spots and neovascularization suggests sickle cell retinopathy as a possible cause for this patient's symptoms, particularly if she has a history of sickle cell disease or trait. Sickle cell retinopathy is characterized by occlusion of small blood vessels in the retina, leading to ischemia and infarction of the inner layers.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to his GP with a complaint of gradually worsening vision in both eyes over several months. On examination, there is no red reflex present in either eye and he has multiple drusen scattered throughout the macula along with areas of geographic atrophy. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Diabetic retinopathy 
B. Central serous chorioretinopathy 
C. Age-related macular degeneration 
D. Hypertensive retinopathy 
E. Sickle cell retinopathy 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presence of drusen and geographic atrophy suggests age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as a possible cause for this patient's symptoms, particularly if he is older than 50 years old and has other risk factors such as smoking or family history of AMD. AMD is a progressive disease that affects the central part of the retina (macula), leading to loss of visual acuity and distortion of images.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the ENT clinic with a 6-month history of progressive loss of smell. She reports that she is unable to smell strong odours such as coffee and perfume, but can still detect some weak odours like garlic and onions. She denies any nasal congestion or discharge, facial pain, or headache. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

What is the most likely cause of her olfactory dysfunction?

A. Chronic rhinosinusitis
B. Idiopathic anosmia
C. Nasal polyps
D. Neurodegenerative disorder
E. Viral upper respiratory tract infection

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of hyposmia (reduced sense of smell) which has been present for more than three months, indicating chronicity. The fact that she can still detect some weak odours suggests partial loss rather than total anosmia (complete loss). Given her age and absence of other nasal symptoms, neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents to his GP with a complaint of sudden onset complete loss of smell over the past week without any preceding illness or trauma to the head or nose. He also complains of difficulty distinguishing between sweet and salty tastes on his tongue despite having no prior taste problems.

On examination, there is no evidence of nasal obstruction or discharge, and cranial nerve examination reveals normal visual acuity, extraocular movements, facial sensation and motor function.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's olfactory dysfunction? 

A. Anosmia due to COVID-19 infection 
B. Congenital anosmia 
C. Head injury causing damage to olfactory nerves 
D. Sinonasal tumour obstructing olfactory clefts 
E. Toxic exposure leading to olfactory nerve damage

Correct Answer: A 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset complete loss of smell and difficulty distinguishing between sweet and salty tastes are highly suggestive of anosmia due to COVID-19 infection. This is a common symptom associated with COVID-19, especially in young adults who may be otherwise asymptomatic or have mild respiratory symptoms.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the neurology clinic with a complaint of recurrent episodes of smelling unpleasant odours that no one else can detect. These episodes last for several minutes before resolving spontaneously. He reports that he has also experienced occasional déjà vu sensations during these episodes but denies any other neurological symptoms.

On examination, there is no evidence of nasal obstruction or discharge, and cranial nerve examination reveals normal visual acuity, extraocular movements, facial sensation and motor function.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Focal aware seizure 
B. Idiopathic phantosmia 
C. Migraine aura without headache 
D. Olfactory hallucination due to medication side effect 
E. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure

Correct Answer: B 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with idiopathic phantosmia (olfactory hallucinations), which is a rare condition characterized by the perception of unpleasant odours in the absence of any external stimuli. It typically affects middle-aged individuals and can be associated with migraine headaches or head trauma. There is no specific treatment for this condition, although some patients may benefit from cognitive-behavioural therapy or use of olfactory training techniques to improve their sense of smell over time.

Question
A 65-year-old male presents to the Emergency Department with severe dizziness and syncope. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. On examination, his blood pressure is found to be low at 80/50 mmHg, and he appears pale and clammy. His heart rate is elevated at 120 beats per minute, but there are no murmurs or gallops on cardiac auscultation. Blood tests reveal anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation? 

A. Acute myocardial infarction
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Septic shock
D. Hypovolemic shock
E. Cardiogenic shock

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests hypovolemic shock due to acute blood loss from an underlying pathology such as gastrointestinal bleeding or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm leading to low blood pressure (hypotension), tachycardia (elevated heart rate), pallor, and cool skin due to decreased perfusion.

Question
A 30-year-old female presents with recurrent episodes of lightheadedness and fainting spells for several months now after standing up from a sitting position or prolonged standing still in one place while working as a cashier at a supermarket checkout counter for long hours daily without any breaks in between shifts. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath but reports palpitations occasionally.

On examination her lying blood pressure is measured as 110/70 mmHg which drops down to 80/60 mmHg within three minutes of standing upright.

What would be the next step in management? 

A. Referral to a neurologist 
B. Prescribe fludrocortisone 
C. Recommend increasing fluid and salt intake 
D. Prescribe midodrine 
E. Recommend compression stockings

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with orthostatic hypotension, which can be managed by increasing fluid and salt intake to expand intravascular volume.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents to the GP with a history of recurrent episodes of dizziness and syncope for several months now. He has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease for which he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) two years ago.

Question
A 57-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of vaginal dryness, painful intercourse and urinary incontinence. She has been experiencing these symptoms for the past year since she went through menopause. The patient is interested in exploring treatment options that can help alleviate her symptoms but is concerned about the risks associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). 

Which one of the following non-hormonal treatments would be most effective in treating this patient's symptoms? 

A. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
B. Clonidine
C. Gabapentin
D. Ospemifene
E. Low-dose vaginal estrogen

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: While HRT is an effective treatment option for menopausal symptoms, it may not be suitable for all patients due to various risk factors such as a history of breast cancer or blood clots. In such cases, non-hormonal treatments are recommended. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that works by mimicking the effects of estrogen on the body without increasing the risk of breast cancer or endometrial hyperplasia.

Question
A 52-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of hot flushes, night sweats and mood changes which have been affecting her quality of life for several months now. She has no significant medical history and takes no regular medications except for occasional paracetamol when needed for pain relief.

Which one of the following investigations should be ordered initially? 

A. Thyroid function tests
B. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels
C. Prolactin levels 
D. Luteinizing hormone (LH) levels 
E. Serum calcium levels

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Menopause is diagnosed based on clinical features such as amenorrhea and vasomotor symptoms. However, in some cases, laboratory investigations may be required to confirm the diagnosis or rule out other causes of menopausal-like symptoms. FSH levels are elevated during menopause due to decreased ovarian function and can help confirm the diagnosis.

Question
A 58-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of joint pain and stiffness which have been affecting her for several months now.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with a history of muscle pain and weakness for the past six months. He has difficulty getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, and lifting objects. He also reports having trouble swallowing food and liquids. On examination, there is proximal muscle weakness in his upper and lower limbs (MRC grade 3/5). There is no sensory loss or reflex abnormalities noted.

Blood tests reveal elevated creatine kinase levels. Electromyography shows myopathic changes, while muscle biopsy reveals endomysial inflammation and necrosis.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Inclusion body myositis
B. Polymyositis
C. Dermatomyositis
D. Myotonic dystrophy type 1
E. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests inclusion body myositis (IBM), which typically affects older adults and involves both proximal and distal muscles, including those involved in swallowing (dysphagia). Elevated creatine kinase levels are common in IBM, as well as electromyographic findings consistent with myopathy and histopathological features such as endomysial inflammation and necrosis seen on muscle biopsy.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with severe muscle pain that started two days ago after she had been exercising at the gym for several hours without proper hydration or rest breaks. She describes her symptoms as diffuse muscle tenderness accompanied by swelling, stiffness, and weakness in her arms, legs, back, neck, and shoulders.

On examination, there is marked tenderness over multiple muscle groups but no joint swelling or erythema noted. Muscle strength testing shows normal results except for mild weakness in her deltoid muscles bilaterally.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Fibromyalgia
B. Viral myositis
C. Polymyalgia rheumatica
D. Rhabdomyolysis
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history of prolonged and intense exercise, coupled with the presence of diffuse muscle pain, swelling, stiffness, and weakness suggests rhabdomyolysis - a condition characterized by the breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers that release their contents into the bloodstream leading to electrolyte imbalances, acute kidney injury, and other complications.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with a two-month history of progressive muscle weakness in his lower limbs accompanied by cramps and fasciculations (involuntary twitching) in his thighs and calves. He also reports difficulty swallowing food and liquids.

On examination, there is marked wasting of his thigh muscles bilaterally (MRC grade 2/5), while his calf muscles are hypertrophied. There is no sensory loss or reflex abnormalities noted.

Blood tests reveal normal creatine kinase levels. Electromyography shows evidence of chronic denervation and reinnervation in affected muscles.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
B. Spinal muscular atrophy type III
C. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type II
D. Hereditary motor neuropathy type V
E. Inclusion body myositis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type II (CMT2), which is an inherited peripheral neuropathy affecting primarily distal limb muscles but can involve proximal muscles as well in some cases leading to muscle weakness and wasting over time. Hypertrophy of calf muscles is a characteristic feature seen in CMT2 patients due to compensatory mechanisms for weakened ankle dorsiflexors during walking. Normal creatine kinase levels rule out primary myopathies as a cause of muscle weakness. Electromyography findings in CMT2 show chronic denervation and reinnervation patterns in affected muscles.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents with a history of recurrent joint pain and swelling, particularly in her hands and feet. She reports that the symptoms are worse in the morning and improve throughout the day. On examination, there is tenderness over multiple small joints, and X-rays reveal erosions at the metacarpophalangeal joints.

Further investigations reveal elevated levels of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. The patient is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and started on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Which of the following DMARDs would be most appropriate as first-line therapy for this patient?

A. Methotrexate
B. Leflunomide
C. Sulfasalazine
D. Hydroxychloroquine
E. Azathioprine

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Methotrexate is considered the first-line DMARD for RA due to its efficacy, safety profile, and low cost.

Question

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her dermatologist with a complaint of discolored and thickened nails on both hands and feet. She reports that the condition has been present for several years, but it has recently worsened. On examination, there is yellowish discoloration of all nails with subungual hyperkeratosis and onycholysis in some fingers.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Lichen planus
B. Psoriasis
C. Onychomycosis
D. Darier’s disease
E. Alopecia areata

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with onychomycosis, which is a fungal infection of the nail bed and plate causing discoloration, thickening, and separation from the nail bed (onycholysis). Lichen planus may cause nail pitting or ridging but not discoloration or thickening as seen in this case. Psoriasis can also cause nail changes such as pitting, oil spots, and lifting off of the nail plate (onycholysis), but typically does not cause yellowish discoloration as seen here. Darier’s disease is an inherited disorder characterized by skin lesions but does not commonly affect nails. Alopecia areata causes hair loss rather than nail abnormalities.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to his general practitioner complaining of painful swelling around his fingernails for two weeks duration after he had a minor injury while playing football with friends at work.
On examination, there is erythema and tenderness overlying the lateral aspect of his right index finger proximal interphalangeal joint with fluctuance noted along the radial side of his distal phalanx.

What is the most appropriate management option? 

A. Incision and drainage 
B. Oral antibiotics 
C. Topical antibiotics 
D. Splinting and observation 
E. Referral to a hand surgeon

Correct Answer: A 

Explanation: The patient is presenting with paronychia, which is an infection of the nail fold. Incision and drainage are the most appropriate management options in cases where there is fluctuance or pus present. Oral antibiotics may be used if the infection is severe or systemic symptoms are present but are not typically first-line treatment for uncomplicated paronychia. Topical antibiotics have limited efficacy in treating deeper infections such as this case. Splinting and observation may be appropriate for mild cases without signs of abscess formation, but incision and drainage should still be considered if there is no improvement after 48 hours. Referral to a hand surgeon would be necessary only in complicated cases.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents to her dermatologist with complaints of painful red nodules on her fingers that have been present for several months. She reports that she has also noticed some changes in her nails, including pitting and ridging.
On examination, there are tender erythematous nodules overlying the distal interphalangeal joints of both hands with loss of angle between the nail fold and nail plate noted on some fingers.

Which one of the following conditions is most likely? 

A. Rheumatoid arthritis
B. Psoriatic arthritis
C. Systemic lupus erythematosus
D. Sarcoidosis
E. Gout

Correct Answer: B 

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with psoriatic arthritis, which commonly causes joint pain and swelling along with nail changes such as pitting and ridging. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause similar joint symptoms but does not typically affect nails in this way. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause joint pain but usually affects larger joints rather than distal interphalangeal joints. Sarcoidosis can cause skin nodules but is not commonly associated with nail changes. Gout typically affects the big toe joint and does not cause nail changes.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to the ENT clinic with a history of nasal obstruction for the past 10 years. She has tried multiple over-the-counter medications and home remedies but nothing seems to work. On examination, there is a large mass in her left nostril obstructing the airway completely.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Allergic Rhinitis
B. Vasomotor Rhinitis
C. Chronic Rhinosinusitis
D. Nasal Polyps
E. Septal Deviation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral nasal obstruction and anosmia following URTI suggest vasomotor rhinitis, which can be triggered by various irritants such as dust, smoke or changes in temperature/humidity rather than allergens like allergic rhinitis.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents with a history of recurrent nasal obstruction and epistaxis for the past few years. He has been using topical decongestants frequently to relieve his symptoms but they only provide temporary relief. On examination, there is a large mass in his right nostril obstructing the airway completely. CT scan shows that the mass is originating from the maxillary sinus and invading into the nasal cavity. What is the most appropriate management option? 

A. Endoscopic resection
B. Radiotherapy
C. Chemotherapy 
D. Maxillectomy 
E. Observation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest an aggressive tumour originating from the maxillary sinus which has invaded into the nasal cavity, making it difficult to manage conservatively or with radiotherapy alone. Therefore, maxillectomy would be considered as the best initial management option to remove all visible disease and prevent further spread of cancer cells.

Question

On examination, he has bilateral ptosis, ophthalmoplegia affecting extraocular muscles except for those innervated by the trochlear nerve (IV), facial diplegia, neck flexor weakness, proximal limb weakness more than distal limb weakness with preserved deep tendon reflexes.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Myasthenia gravis 
B. Guillain-Barré syndrome 
C. Botulism 
D. Polymyositis 
E. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical features described suggest botulism as a potential diagnosis. Botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions leading to flaccid paralysis.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with a six-month history of night sweats, weight loss and fatigue. He has no significant past medical history and is not taking any medications. On examination, he has palpable lymph nodes in his neck, axilla and groin. Blood tests reveal elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and anemia. CT scan shows multiple enlarged lymph nodes throughout the body, including mediastinal involvement. Biopsy of one of the lymph nodes reveals diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line treatment for this patient? 

A. Chemotherapy with R-CHOP
B. Corticosteroids 
C. Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab 
D. Radiotherapy to affected areas 
E. Surgical excision of affected lymph nodes

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: DLBCL is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that requires prompt treatment with chemotherapy such as R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone). Corticosteroids may be used in conjunction with chemotherapy but are not considered first-line therapy on their own. Immunotherapy may be used in certain cases but is not typically first-line treatment for DLBCL. Radiotherapy or surgical excision may be used as adjuncts to chemotherapy but are not typically used as sole treatments.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a three-month history of night sweats and intermittent fevers up to 38°C along with weight loss and fatigue. She denies any cough or shortness of breath but reports occasional chest pain that worsens when lying down flat at night. Physical exam reveals dullness to percussion over the left lung base and decreased breath sounds on auscultation in that area; there are no palpable lymph nodes. Chest X-ray shows a large left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Thoracentesis is performed and reveals exudative fluid with high levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Tuberculosis 
B. Lung cancer 
C. Lymphoma 
D. Heart failure 
E. Pulmonary embolism

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The combination of night sweats, fevers, weight loss, fatigue and pleural effusion should raise suspicion for tuberculosis (TB), especially in endemic areas or in patients with risk factors such as HIV infection or recent travel to TB-endemic regions. Elevated ADA levels in pleural fluid are highly suggestive of TB but can also be seen in other conditions such as empyema or rheumatoid arthritis. Diagnosis requires isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from sputum or other specimens; treatment involves a combination of antibiotics for several months.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents with a one-month history of night sweats, fever up to 39°C and non-productive cough along with diffuse rash on his trunk and extremities that started two weeks ago. He denies any weight loss or lymphadenopathy but reports occasional joint pain and swelling in his knees and ankles that started around the same time as the rash. Physical exam reveals bilateral knee effusions without erythema or warmth; there are no palpable lymph nodes or hepatosplenomegaly. Blood tests reveal elevated acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); chest X-ray is normal but CT scan shows mild hilar lymphadenopathy without pulmonary infiltrates. Skin biopsy reveals leukocytoclastic vasculitis consistent with cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV). Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause? 

A. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
B. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
C. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) 
D. Behcet's disease 
E. Sarcoidosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: CSVV can be a manifestation of various systemic vasculitides, including GPA (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis), which typically presents with upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sinusitis or otitis media along with pulmonary infiltrates and/or nodules; hilar lymphadenopathy is also common. Joint involvement may occur in up to 50% of patients but is usually not severe or erosive like in RA. Other possible causes of CSVV include infections, drugs or malignancies; however, the absence of any infectious or neoplastic features on workup makes these less likely in this case.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of bilateral nipple discharge for the past 6 months. She reports that the discharge is watery and occurs spontaneously without any manipulation of the breasts. On further questioning, she reveals that she has been experiencing irregular menstrual cycles and occasional hot flushes. Her medical history is unremarkable, and there is no family history of breast cancer or endocrine disorders. On examination, both nipples appear normal, but there is a palpable lump in the left breast. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Intraductal papilloma
B. Duct ectasia 
C. Prolactinoma 
D. Breast cancer 
E. Fibrocystic changes

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests an intraductal papilloma as it commonly causes spontaneous unilateral or bilateral nipple discharge which may be clear or blood-stained and can be associated with a palpable mass in the affected breast.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of bloody nipple discharge from his right breast for the past month. He denies any pain or swelling in either breast but reports feeling fatigued lately and having lost weight unintentionally over the last few weeks. His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes medication regularly, but he denies any family history of malignancies or hormonal imbalances. On examination, there are no palpable masses in either breast, but there is some erythema around the right nipple area with mild tenderness on touch. What should be your next step? 

A. Order mammography followed by biopsy if needed
B. Prescribe antibiotics for mastitis
C. Refer to an endocrinologist for hormone level testing
D. Perform fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the right breast
E. Advise the patient to return for follow-up in 6 months

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of bloody nipple discharge, erythema, and tenderness around the right nipple area raises concern for breast cancer or inflammatory breast disease. Therefore, mammography should be ordered as the first step followed by biopsy if needed.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents with a history of bilateral greenish-brown nipple discharge that occurs spontaneously without any manipulation of her breasts. She reports having irregular menstrual cycles and occasional headaches but denies any significant medical or family history. On examination, there are no palpable masses in either breast, but there is some mild tenderness on touch over both nipples. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Duct ectasia 
B. Intraductal papilloma
C. Prolactinoma 
D. Fibrocystic changes 
E. Breast abscess

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests duct ectasia as it commonly causes spontaneous bilateral nipple discharge which may be greenish-brown in color and associated with mild tenderness over the nipples without any palpable masses in the breasts.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents for her first antenatal care check at eight weeks’ gestation. She has a history of recurrent miscarriages and is anxious about the current pregnancy. During the booking visit, she asks you if there are any tests that can be done to determine whether this pregnancy will result in a live birth. What would you advise? Explain your answer.

A. Offer early pregnancy ultrasound scan
B. Offer chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
C. Offer amniocentesis
D. Advise on non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT)
E. Reassure patient and offer routine antenatal care

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient is understandably anxious due to her previous history of recurrent miscarriages; however, it is important to reassure her that most pregnancies result in a healthy baby without complications. Offering an early pregnancy ultrasound scan or invasive testing such as CVS or amniocentesis may not be necessary unless there are specific indications for these tests based on maternal age, family history or abnormal screening results from other antenatal tests. NIPT may also be considered but should be discussed with the patient regarding its limitations and accuracy.

Question
A 35-year-old pregnant woman attends for her routine antenatal appointment at 28 weeks’ gestation. This is her second pregnancy, and she had a previous caesarean section due to fetal distress during labour at term with her first child who weighed 3kg at birth. Her blood pressure is normal, and urinalysis shows no proteinuria or glycosuria.
What advice would you give regarding mode of delivery? Explain your answer.

A. Offer elective repeat caesarean section
B. Offer trial of vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC)
C. Discuss risks and benefits of both options with the patient
D. Recommend induction of labour at 39 weeks’ gestation
E. Refer patient to obstetrician for further management

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The mode of delivery in a woman with a previous caesarean section depends on various factors such as the reason for the previous caesarean, maternal preference, and risks associated with both options. In this case, the patient had a previous caesarean due to fetal distress during labour at term with a normal-sized baby. Therefore, she may be offered VBAC after discussing the risks and benefits of both options with her based on current evidence-based guidelines.

Question
A 30-year-old pregnant woman presents for her routine antenatal appointment at 36 weeks’ gestation. This is her first pregnancy, and she has been well throughout. She is concerned about whether she will be able to breastfeed her baby once it is born.
What advice would you give? Explain your answer.

A. Advise that breastfeeding is not always possible or successful
B. Recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months
C. Discuss different positions for breastfeeding
D. Offer referral to lactation consultant if needed
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Breastfeeding is recommended by health authorities worldwide due to its numerous benefits for both mother and baby; however, it may not always be possible or successful due to various reasons such as medical conditions, lack of support or knowledge etc. Therefore, it is important to discuss different aspects of breastfeeding including its benefits, techniques and potential challenges with patients during antenatal care visits so they can make an informed decision regarding their feeding choice once their baby is born. Referral to a lactation consultant should also be considered if needed to provide additional support and guidance postnatally.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of oliguria for the last 2 days. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, for which he takes medication. On examination, his blood pressure is 180/110 mmHg, and he appears dehydrated. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated serum creatinine levels at 400 µmol/L (normal range: 55-120 µmol/L) and low urine output at less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour. An ultrasound shows normal-sized kidneys without any obstruction or hydronephrosis.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's oliguria?

A. Acute tubular necrosis
B. Glomerulonephritis
C. Interstitial nephritis
D. Obstructive uropathy
E. Prerenal azotemia

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with prerenal azotemia due to dehydration from uncontrolled hypertension and/or medication use leading to decreased renal perfusion and subsequent decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This can be confirmed by performing a fluid challenge test or checking fractional excretion of sodium (FENa).

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and decreased urine output for the past week. She has no significant medical history but reports taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) regularly for menstrual cramps over the past few months. On examination, she appears pale and dehydrated with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg.

Laboratory investigations reveal elevated serum creatinine levels at 300 µmol/L (normal range: 55-120 µmol/L), low urine output at less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour, anaemia with haemoglobin levels at 8 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL), and thrombocytopenia with platelet counts at 50,000/mm3 (normal range: 150,000-450,000/mm3).

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acute interstitial nephritis
B. Acute tubular necrosis
C. Glomerulonephritis
D. Hemolytic uremic syndrome
E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) due to NSAID-induced microvascular injury leading to platelet aggregation and formation of small blood clots in the kidneys, resulting in decreased renal perfusion and subsequent decrease in GFR. This can be confirmed by performing a peripheral blood smear for schistocytes or checking ADAMTS13 activity levels.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of oliguria for the past few days along with swelling in his legs and feet.

Laboratory investigations reveal elevated serum creatinine levels at 250 µmol/L (normal range: 55-120 µmol/L), low urine output at less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour, proteinuria at more than 3 g/day (normal range: <150 mg/day), and hypoalbuminemia with albumin levels at 20 g/L (normal range: >35 g/L).

What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?

A. Admit to hospital for intravenous diuretics and fluid management
B. Initiate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy
C. Refer urgently to a nephrologist for renal biopsy
D. Start corticosteroid therapy for suspected glomerulonephritis
E. Withdraw all antihypertensive medications

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with nephrotic syndrome due to underlying chronic kidney disease, leading to proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and oedema formation. ACE inhibitors are the first-line treatment for reducing proteinuria and slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Referral to a nephrologist may be considered if there is suspicion of an underlying glomerular disease that requires further evaluation or management.

She denies any chest pain or dyspnea during these episodes but reports feeling anxious when they occur. Her medical history includes hypertension treated with lisinopril for the past year, otherwise unremarkable except for occasional migraines treated with sumatriptan as needed. Physical exam reveals a regular pulse at 110 bpm without murmur or gallop; blood pressure is normal at 130/80 mmHg; neurological exam is unremarkable.
Which medication could be contributing to her symptoms? 

A. Sumatriptan 
B. Lisinopril 
C. Aspirin 
D. Metformin 
E. Atorvastatin

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Sumatriptan is a triptan medication used to treat migraines, which can cause vasoconstriction of coronary arteries and increase the risk of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias in susceptible patients. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which can be triggered by sympathomimetic agents such as sumatriptan.

Question
A 58-year-old male presents with palpitations that have been occurring intermittently for several years but have become more frequent over the past month. He describes the palpitations as a rapid, regular heartbeat that lasts for several minutes and resolves spontaneously without any other symptoms. He has no significant medical history except for hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and losartan for the past year; he denies smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use.
What is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test? 

A. Exercise stress test
B. Echocardiogram
C. Holter monitor
D. Cardiac catheterization
E. Electrophysiology study

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), which is characterized by sudden onset and termination of a regular narrow-complex tachycardia lasting seconds to hours. Holter monitoring is an appropriate initial diagnostic test to capture these episodes and confirm the diagnosis of PSVT before considering further management options such as pharmacologic therapy or ablation procedures if necessary.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a pelvic mass and abnormal vaginal bleeding. She has a history of endometriosis and infertility, for which she underwent multiple cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF). On examination, there is a large solid mass on the right side of her pelvis that is adherent to the uterus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a complex cystic-solid mass measuring 10 cm × 8 cm × 6 cm, with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The patient undergoes surgical resection of the mass, and histopathology reveals an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Which one of the following types of ovarian cancer is most likely to be diagnosed in this patient? 

A. Clear cell carcinoma
B. Mucinous adenocarcinoma
C. Endometrioid carcinoma
D. Serous adenocarcinoma
E. Germ cell tumor

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's history of endometriosis increases her risk for developing endometrioid carcinoma, which accounts for approximately 20% of all epithelial ovarian cancers.

Question
A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with abdominal distension and discomfort for several months. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the lower abdomen that extends into the pelvis but does not appear to be fixed to any adjacent structures or organs. Computed tomography (CT) scan shows a large multilocular cystic mass measuring 18 cm × 12 cm arising from the left ovary.
What is the most appropriate initial management option for this patient? 

A. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 
B. Laparoscopic removal of the left ovary 
C. Chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery 
D. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the cystic fluid 
E. Observation with serial imaging 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The size and appearance of the mass on CT scan suggest a high likelihood of malignancy, and therefore surgical resection is the most appropriate initial management option.

Question
A 48-year-old woman presents with lower abdominal pain and bloating for several weeks. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the left iliac fossa that appears to be fixed to the pelvic sidewall. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a solid mass measuring 8 cm × 6 cm arising from the left ovary.
Which one of the following tumor markers is most likely to be elevated in this patient? 

A. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
B. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
C. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
D. Ca-125
E. Inhibin A

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Inhibin A is a tumor marker associated with granulosa cell tumors, which account for approximately 2% of all ovarian cancers and are more commonly seen in premenopausal women presenting with symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding or infertility.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe pelvic pain that started suddenly while she was at work. She describes the pain as sharp and constant, radiating to her lower back and thighs. She has a history of endometriosis and had laparoscopic surgery for it two years ago. On examination, there is tenderness in the right iliac fossa, guarding, and rebound tenderness.
Which one of the following is most likely? 

A. Ovarian torsion
B. Ectopic pregnancy
C. Acute appendicitis
D. Ruptured ovarian cyst
E. Pelvic inflammatory disease

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a ruptured ovarian cyst, which can cause sudden onset pelvic pain that may radiate to other areas such as the lower back or thighs. Tenderness in the right iliac fossa could be due to irritation of the peritoneum by blood from the ruptured cyst.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with chronic pelvic pain that has been ongoing for several months. She describes the pain as dull and achy, mostly located in her lower abdomen but occasionally radiating to her lower back or legs. She also reports dyspareunia and painful bowel movements during menstruation.
On examination, there is no palpable mass or tenderness on abdominal or pelvic exam.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Endometriosis 
B. Adenomyosis 
C. Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease 
D. Irritable bowel syndrome 
E. Uterine fibroids

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with endometriosis, which can cause chronic pelvic pain that may worsen during menstruation or sexual activity.

Question
A 42-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of chronic pelvic pain that has been ongoing for several years. She describes the pain as a dull ache, mostly located in her lower abdomen and pelvis but occasionally radiating to her thighs. The pain is worse during prolonged standing or sitting and improves with lying down.
On examination, there is no palpable mass or tenderness on abdominal or pelvic exam.
Which one of the following is most likely? 

A. Pelvic congestion syndrome 
B. Ovarian cyst 
C. Uterine fibroids 
D. Endometriosis 
E. Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with pelvic congestion syndrome, which can cause chronic pelvic pain that worsens with prolonged standing or sitting due to increased pressure on the veins in the pelvis. There may be no physical findings on examination, making diagnosis challenging.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the GP with a six-month history of perianal itching, pain and bleeding on defecation. He reports occasional constipation but no other gastrointestinal symptoms. On examination, there is erythema and excoriation around the anus or perineal area with multiple skin tags noted. The doctor suspects an underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and orders further investigations.

Which of the following tests would be most useful in confirming a diagnosis of IBD in this patient? 

A. Faecal calprotectin
B. Colonoscopy 
C. Abdominal ultrasound
D. Stool culture for ova and parasites
E. Magnetic resonance enterography

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: While faecal calprotectin can indicate inflammation in the gut, it is not specific for IBD and can also be elevated in infections or other conditions such as diverticulitis. Abdominal ultrasound may show signs of inflammation but is less sensitive than colonoscopy for detecting IBD-related changes in the colon or rectum. Stool cultures are used to identify infectious causes of diarrhoea rather than IBD, while magnetic resonance enterography is more commonly used to assess small bowel involvement in Crohn’s disease.

Question
A 30-year-old female presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of painful anal fissures over several months despite conservative management including stool softeners and topical treatments.
She has no significant medical history apart from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which she manages well with dietary modifications.
On examination, there is evidence of a chronic anal fissure at the posterior midline with associated hypertrophied anal papilla.
What is the next best step in managing this patient? 

A. Surgical sphincterotomy 
B. Botulinum toxin injection into internal anal sphincter 
C. Nitroglycerin ointment 
D. Topical corticosteroids 
E. Calcium channel blockers 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Botulinum toxin injection into the internal anal sphincter has been shown to be effective in treating chronic anal fissures by relaxing the muscle and reducing spasm, allowing healing of the fissure. Surgical sphincterotomy is reserved for refractory cases or those with underlying conditions such as Crohn’s disease. Nitroglycerin ointment can cause headaches and hypotension, while topical corticosteroids are not recommended for long-term use due to potential side effects such as skin thinning and increased risk of infection. Calcium channel blockers have limited evidence supporting their use in this context.

Question
A 65-year-old male presents to his GP with a six-month history of perianal pain and swelling that has progressively worsened despite conservative management including sitz baths and oral analgesics.
On examination, there is a tender fluctuant mass at the right lateral aspect of the anus measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.
The doctor suspects an abscess but notes that it appears to be located deep within the tissue rather than superficially.
What imaging modality would be most useful in evaluating this patient? 

A. Ultrasound
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
C. Computed tomography (CT) scan
D. X-ray 
E. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: MRI is considered the gold standard for evaluating perianal abscesses as it provides excellent soft tissue contrast resolution and can differentiate between fluid collections, inflammatory changes, and fistula tracts. Ultrasound may also be used but is less sensitive than MRI for detecting deeper abscesses or associated fistulas. CT scans are generally not preferred due to radiation exposure and lower sensitivity compared to MRI, while X-rays are not indicated for assessing soft tissue structures. PET scans are used in oncology for detecting metastatic disease and are not indicated in this context.

Question
A 55-year-old male presents with bilateral ankle swelling that has been gradually worsening over the past few months. He reports no chest pain, shortness of breath or cough, and denies any history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. On examination, there is pitting oedema up to the mid-calf bilaterally with no other significant findings on respiratory or cardiovascular examination. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits. Routine blood tests reveal a serum albumin level of 2g/dL and an elevated creatinine level of 1.8mg/dL. Urine analysis shows proteinuria with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 3:1. 
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? 

A. Nephrotic syndrome
B. Acute glomerulonephritis
C. Chronic kidney disease
D. Congestive heart failure
E. Liver cirrhosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features are suggestive of nephrotic syndrome which is characterized by peripheral oedema due to hypoalbuminaemia caused by excessive urinary loss of proteins (proteinuria). The presence of proteinuria with a high urine protein-to-creatinine ratio supports this diagnosis.

Question
A 65-year-old female presents to her GP clinic complaining of bilateral ankle swelling that has been present for several weeks now and has not improved despite taking diuretics prescribed by her previous doctor for presumed congestive heart failure (CHF). She also complains of fatigue, weight gain, and decreased appetite but denies any chest pain or shortness of breath at rest or on exertion. Her medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, type II diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which she uses salbutamol inhaler as required.
On examination, there is pitting oedema up to the mid-calf bilaterally with no other significant findings on respiratory or cardiovascular examination. The patient's blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 80 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Routine blood tests reveal a serum creatinine level of 1.6mg/dL and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? 

A. Chronic kidney disease
B. Congestive heart failure
C. Liver cirrhosis
D. Pulmonary embolism
E. Protein-losing enteropathy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical features are suggestive of congestive heart failure which is characterized by peripheral oedema due to fluid retention caused by impaired cardiac function leading to increased venous pressure and reduced renal perfusion resulting in activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) causing sodium and water retention.

Question
A 70-year-old male presents with unilateral ankle swelling that has been present for several months now without any pain or discomfort but has gradually worsened over time despite taking diuretics prescribed by his previous doctor for presumed congestive heart failure (CHF). He reports no chest pain, shortness of breath or cough, and denies any history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. On examination, there is pitting oedema up to the mid-calf unilaterally with no other significant findings on respiratory or cardiovascular examination except for a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa region.
Routine blood tests reveal normal renal function and electrolyte levels but an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. An abdominal ultrasound reveals a large cystic mass arising from the right ovary measuring approximately 10cm x 8cm.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? 

A. Ovarian cancer
B. Congestive heart failure
C. Chronic kidney disease
D. Liver cirrhosis
E. Deep vein thrombosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features are suggestive of ovarian cancer which can present with unilateral lower limb swelling due to compression of the iliac veins by a large pelvic mass leading to venous stasis and oedema formation. The elevated alkaline phosphatase level is indicative of bone metastases commonly seen in advanced stages of ovarian cancer.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a petechial rash on his legs and arms, which has been progressively worsening over the past few days. He reports feeling fatigued and experiencing mild feverish symptoms. Upon examination, he is found to have hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Blood tests reveal thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and anemia. The patient denies any recent travel or exposure to infectious agents but admits to having unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the past month. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Rocky Mountain spotted fever
B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
C. Infectious mononucleosis 
D. Leptospirosis 
E. Acute HIV infection

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with DIC, a condition characterized by widespread activation of coagulation leading to microvascular thrombi formation and depletion of clotting factors resulting in bleeding manifestations such as petechiae and ecchymoses.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents with a diffuse petechial rash that started on her lower extremities before spreading upwards towards her trunk within hours of onset accompanied by severe abdominal pain and vomiting after eating undercooked meat at a family gathering earlier that day. She also complains of muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and chest pain upon deep inspiration since the rash appeared.
On physical examination, she appears pale and tachycardic with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation; there are no other significant findings except for scattered petechiae all over her body.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Anaphylaxis
B. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
C. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
D. Septicemia
E. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with HUS, a condition characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. It is most commonly caused by infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), which can be transmitted through undercooked meat.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of a petechial rash on his legs that has been present for several weeks. He reports feeling generally unwell with fatigue and weight loss over the past few months. On examination, he has hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy.
Blood tests reveal pancytopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Bone marrow biopsy shows infiltration of malignant cells into the bone marrow space.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute myeloid leukemia 
B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
C. Multiple myeloma 
D. Hodgkin's lymphoma 
E. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a malignancy of the lymphatic system characterized by abnormal proliferation of B or T cells leading to organ infiltration and systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Pancytopenia may result from bone marrow involvement or immune-mediated destruction of blood cells.

Question
A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a history of cough, fever and shortness of breath for the past two weeks. On examination, there is dullness to percussion on the left side of his chest. Chest x-ray reveals a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the left side. Pleural aspiration is performed and the fluid analysis shows an exudative effusion with high levels of protein and LDH.

Which of the following conditions is most likely causing this patient's pleural effusion? 

A. Congestive heart failure
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Rheumatoid arthritis 
D. Tuberculosis 
E. Lung cancer

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation along with the findings on chest x-ray and pleural fluid analysis suggest that this patient has an exudative pleural effusion, which can be caused by various underlying conditions such as infections (e.g., tuberculosis), malignancies (e.g., lung cancer), autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or pulmonary embolism. However, given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, tuberculosis is the most likely cause in this case.

Question
A 70-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with complaints of shortness of breath and fatigue for several months. She reports no significant medical history except for hypertension which is well-controlled with medication. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds over both lungs and dullness to percussion at the right base.

What diagnostic test would you recommend next? 

A. CT scan of chest
B. Bronchoscopy 
C. Echocardiogram 
D. Pulmonary function tests 
E. Thoracentesis 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Given that this patient has chronic symptoms suggestive of respiratory disease along with physical exam findings consistent with a possible pleural effusion, further imaging studies are warranted to evaluate the underlying cause. A CT scan of the chest is the most appropriate next step as it can provide detailed information about lung parenchyma, pleural space and mediastinum.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. On examination, there is decreased breath sounds on the left side and dullness to percussion over that area. Chest x-ray reveals a large left-sided pleural effusion with associated collapse of the left lung.

What is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Thoracentesis 
B. Chest tube insertion 
C. Antibiotic therapy 
D. Bronchoscopy 
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In this patient with a large pleural effusion causing significant respiratory distress, immediate intervention is necessary to relieve symptoms and prevent complications such as infection or empyema formation. The most appropriate initial management would be chest tube insertion to drain the fluid and re-expand the collapsed lung. Thoracentesis may not be sufficient in this case due to the size of the effusion, while antibiotic therapy or bronchoscopy are not indicated as primary interventions for pleural effusions.

Question
A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. He reports that he ingested a large amount of mushrooms from his garden earlier in the day. On examination, he has dilated pupils and dry skin.

Which of the following toxins found in mushrooms is responsible for this patient's symptoms? 

A. Muscimol
B. Psilocybin
C. Ibotenic acid
D. Gyromitrin 
E. Coprine

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The toxin gyromitrin found in certain types of mushrooms can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea as well as neurological symptoms such as dilated pupils and dry skin.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after being found unconscious at home by her flatmate. She has a history of depression and was prescribed an antidepressant medication two weeks ago which she had been taking regularly since then.

On examination, she is unresponsive with shallow breathing and pinpoint pupils.

Which class of medications is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation? 

A. Benzodiazepines
B. Opioids
C. Antidepressants 
D. Antipsychotics 
E. Stimulants

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Pinpoint pupils are a classic sign of opioid toxicity which can cause respiratory depression leading to coma or death.

Question
A 48-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion, agitation, tremors and seizures after drinking several bottles of antifreeze over the past few hours.

What is the mechanism of action of ethylene glycol poisoning? 

A. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity 
B. Binding to GABA receptors in the central nervous system 
C. Blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels 
D. Inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain 
E. Formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Ethylene glycol is metabolized into toxic compounds that can cause metabolic acidosis, renal failure and formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys leading to acute kidney injury.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with excessive thirst and frequent urination for the past few months. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is well-controlled on metformin. On examination, he appears euvolaemic when assessing hydration status, and his vital signs are within normal range.

Investigations reveal:

- Random blood glucose: 8.6 mmol/L (3.9-7.8)
- HbA1c: 7% (4%-6%)
- Serum osmolality: 300 mOsm/kg (275-295)
- Urine osmolality after fluid deprivation: 200 mOsm/kg (50-1200)
- Urine osmolality after desmopressin: 700 mOsm/kg (50-1200)

What is the most likely diagnosis? Provide a rationale for your answer.

A. Psychogenic polydipsia
B. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
C. Cranial diabetes insipidus
D. Primary polydipsia
E. Diabetes mellitus insipidus

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests that he may have diabetes insipidus due to excessive thirst and frequent urination despite having controlled blood sugar levels with metformin therapy. The urine osmolality test confirms this suspicion as it shows low urine concentration even after fluid deprivation but responds appropriately to desmopressin administration by increasing urine concentration significantly above baseline values (>50%). This indicates that there is an inadequate secretion or action of antidiuretic hormone in the body leading to impaired water reabsorption in the kidneys causing polyuria and compensatory polydipsia.

Question
A 40-year-old woman presents with complaints of excessive thirst and dry mouth for several weeks. She has a history of hypothyroidism, which is well-controlled on levothyroxine therapy. On examination, she appears euvolaemic when assessing hydration status, and her vital signs are within normal range.

Investigations reveal:

- Serum sodium: 148 mmol/L (135-145)
- Serum potassium: 3.5 mmol/L (3.5-5.1)
- Urine osmolality after fluid deprivation: 300 mOsm/kg (50-1200)
- Urine osmolality after desmopressin: 305 mOsm/kg (50-1200)

What is the most likely diagnosis? Provide a rationale for your answer.

A. Primary polydipsia
B. Cranial diabetes insipidus
C. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
D. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)
E. Hypokalemia-induced thirst

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests that she may have SIADH due to excessive thirst and dry mouth despite being adequately hydrated as evidenced by normal urine concentration tests even after fluid deprivation but with no significant response to desmopressin administration indicating adequate endogenous ADH levels in the body leading to water retention causing hyponatremia and low serum potassium levels.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents with complaints of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and weight loss over the past few months. He has no significant medical history or family history of diabetes mellitus or other chronic illnesses.

On examination, he appears dehydrated when assessing hydration status, and his vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension.

Investigations reveal:

- Random blood glucose: 24 mmol/L (>7mmol/l indicates hyperglycemia)
- HbA1c: 11% (4%-6%)
- Serum osmolality: 320 mOsm/kg (275-295)
- Urine osmolality after fluid deprivation: 700 mOsm/kg (50-1200)
- Urine osmolality after desmopressin: <50 mOsm/kg (50-1200)

What is the most likely diagnosis? Provide a rationale for your answer.

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus
B. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
C. Primary polydipsia
D. Diabetes mellitus type 2
E. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests that he may have hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state due to excessive thirst, frequent urination, and weight loss with severe dehydration as evidenced by tachycardia and hypotension on vital signs examination. The high blood glucose levels (>7mmol/l) and elevated HbA1c levels (>6%) indicate uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2 leading to increased serum osmolality causing compensatory polydipsia and diuresis leading to further dehydration and electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic acidosis if left untreated.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. He was discharged home on the same day as his surgery. On postoperative day two, he presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. His abdomen is tender to palpation in all quadrants. Laboratory studies reveal leukocytosis and elevated liver function tests.
What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Wound infection
B. Acute pancreatitis
C. Bile duct injury
D. Post-cholecystectomy syndrome
E. Cholangitis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute cholangitis, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of biliary tract disease that can occur after cholecystectomy due to retained stones or sludge in the common bile duct.

Question
A 50-year-old woman underwent a total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma three days ago. She has been recovering well until this morning when she developed sudden onset dyspnea and chest pain while ambulating in her hospital room. Her oxygen saturation drops from 98% on room air to 88%. Physical examination reveals tachycardia and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pulmonary embolism 
B. Pneumothorax 
C. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
D. Hospital-acquired pneumonia 
E. Myocardial infarction 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a tension pneumothorax, which can occur as a rare but serious complication following thyroid surgery due to injury to the trachea or bronchi during intubation or dissection.

Question
A 70-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension underwent an elective open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. On postoperative day one, he develops sudden onset hypotension, tachycardia, and oliguria. Physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal tenderness and absent bowel sounds.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute mesenteric ischemia 
B. Aortic dissection 
C. Retroperitoneal hematoma 
D. Bowel obstruction 
E. Septic shock

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which can occur as a rare but potentially life-threatening complication following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair due to injury to the lumbar arteries or venous plexus during surgery.

Question
A 37-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 14 weeks gestation for her first pregnancy. She has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, both well-controlled with medication. You recommend screening tests to assess her risk of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. The patient is concerned about the risks associated with invasive testing and asks about non-invasive options.

Which one of the following statements regarding non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is correct?

A. NIPT can detect all types of chromosomal abnormalities
B. NIPT carries no risk of miscarriage
C. NIPT results are available within 24 hours
D. NIPT is more accurate than invasive testing methods
E. NIPT cannot be performed if there is a twin pregnancy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: While NIPT is highly accurate, it does not detect all types of chromosomal abnormalities and may miss some cases of mosaicism or structural abnormalities that amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) would detect. Additionally, while the risk of miscarriage with NIPT is lower than with invasive testing, it is not zero.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 8 weeks gestation for her second pregnancy after having had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery two years prior. She has no significant medical history but expresses concern about the possibility of fetal anomalies or genetic disorders in this pregnancy.

Which one of the following tests would you recommend as part of routine screening for this patient? 

A. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP)
B. Non-stress test (NST)
C. Fetal echocardiography 
D. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
E. Ultrasound examination including nuchal translucency measurement

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Routine screening for fetal anomalies and genetic disorders typically includes an ultrasound examination with nuchal translucency measurement, which is performed between 11-14 weeks gestation. MSAFP is a marker for neural tube defects and is usually offered at around 16-18 weeks gestation. NST and fetal echocardiography are not routine screening tests.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 20 weeks gestation for her first pregnancy. She has no significant medical history but expresses concern about the possibility of preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes (PROM). You recommend testing to assess her risk.

Which one of the following tests would you recommend? 

A. Fetal fibronectin (fFN) test
B. Amniotic fluid index (AFI)
C. Cervical length measurement 
D. Maternal serum progesterone level
E. Non-stress test (NST)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The fFN test can predict the likelihood of preterm labor or PROM within the next two weeks in women who have symptoms such as vaginal bleeding or contractions before 37 weeks gestation, or those with a history of preterm birth. AFI measures the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus and may be used to assess fetal well-being but does not specifically predict preterm labor or PROM. Cervical length measurement and maternal serum progesterone levels may also be used to assess risk for preterm delivery but are not routinely recommended in low-risk pregnancies without symptoms or prior history of preterm birth. NST is a test that monitors fetal heart rate patterns and is used to evaluate fetal well-being but does not predict preterm labor or PROM.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 24 weeks gestation with a history of previous preterm delivery at 32 weeks. She has no significant medical history and is not taking any medications. Her obstetric ultrasound shows cervical length of 20mm, and fetal growth is appropriate for gestational age. The patient is counselled on the use of vaginal progesterone, but she expresses concerns about its safety and efficacy.

Which of the following statements regarding vaginal progesterone in preventing preterm birth is true? 

A. Vaginal progesterone reduces the risk of preterm birth by up to 50% in women with a short cervix.
B. Vaginal progesterone should be avoided in women with a history of preterm delivery due to increased risk of adverse effects.
C. Vaginal progesterone is contraindicated in women with multiple pregnancies.
D. Vaginal progesterone should only be used after 34 weeks gestation.
E. Vaginal progesterone has no proven benefit in reducing the risk of preterm birth.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Several studies have shown that vaginal progesterone can reduce the risk of preterm birth by up to 50% in women with a short cervix (<25mm) detected on transvaginal ultrasound between 16-24 weeks gestation.

Question
A premature infant born at 29 weeks gestation weighing 1 kg develops respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) shortly after birth and requires mechanical ventilation for several days before being extubated onto continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). On day five, he becomes increasingly tachypnoeic and his oxygen requirements increase despite maximal CPAP support.

What is the most likely cause for this deterioration? 

A. Pulmonary haemorrhage
B. Pneumothorax
C. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
D. Sepsis
E. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: PDA is a common complication of prematurity and can lead to increased pulmonary blood flow, left atrial and ventricular dilation, and eventually heart failure.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 30 weeks gestation with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She has no significant medical history but reports a previous preterm delivery at 34 weeks due to premature rupture of membranes (PROM). On examination, her cervix is found to be dilated 3cm with bulging membranes visible on speculum examination.

Which of the following interventions is most likely to prolong pregnancy? 

A. Immediate delivery by caesarean section
B. Administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation
C. Antibiotic therapy for chorioamnionitis
D. Tocolytic therapy with nifedipine or indomethacin 
E. Expectant management with close monitoring

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Tocolytic agents such as nifedipine or indomethacin can be used in women with threatened preterm labour before 34 weeks gestation to delay delivery and allow time for administration of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation and transfer to a tertiary neonatal unit if necessary. However, their use should be balanced against potential side effects such as maternal hypotension or gastrointestinal upset and careful consideration given to individual patient factors such as cervical dilatation and presence of infection or fetal compromise.

Factors influencing the decision to proceed with SNS include patient preference, severity of symptoms, response to conservative measures, comorbidities, and cost-effectiveness.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of rectal prolapse since childhood. She reports having difficulty controlling her bowels and experiences constipation alternating with diarrhea.
On examination, there is evidence of a full-thickness rectal prolapse extending beyond the anal verge. The patient has previously tried conservative management with no improvement.
What are the different surgical options available?

A. Abdominal approach
B. Perineal approach
C. Transanal approach
D. Laparoscopic approach
E. Combined abdominal-perineal approach

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Surgical management of rectal prolapse depends on several factors such as age of the patient, extent of prolapse, associated pelvic floor defects and surgeon expertise. Various surgical approaches are available including abdominal approach (rectopexy or resection-anastomosis), perineal approach (Altemeier procedure), transanal approach (Delorme's procedure) and laparoscopic approach (laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy). The combined abdominal-perineal approach provides good exposure for correction of any associated pelvic floor defects and has a lower recurrence rate compared to other approaches. However, it carries a higher risk of morbidity such as wound infection, hernia formation, urinary retention, sexual dysfunction and requires longer hospital stay and recovery time. The decision regarding the choice of surgical approach should be individualized based on patient factors such as age, comorbidities, severity of symptoms and surgeon expertise.

E. Neurogenic shock

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests obstructive shock due to a left-sided hemothorax, which is causing compression of the lung and decreased venous return to the heart. The reduced air entry on the left side of the chest and confirmation of a hemothorax on chest X-ray support this diagnosis.

Question
A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department with fever, chills, and confusion for the past two days. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was recently discharged from hospital after being treated for pneumonia.

On examination, his vital signs are as follows:
Heart rate: 110 bpm
Blood pressure: 90/60 mmHg
Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
Oxygen saturations on room air: 88%

On auscultation, there are bilateral crackles in the lungs and an S4 gallop rhythm is heard on cardiac examination.

What type of shock does this patient most likely have? 

A. Hypovolemic shock
B. Cardiogenic shock
C. Septic shock
D. Obstructive shock
E. Neurogenic shock

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests septic shock due to possible recurrent or unresolved pneumonia in a patient with COPD who was recently hospitalized. The presence of fever, chills, confusion, tachycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress with low oxygen saturation levels along with bilateral crackles in lungs suggest sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. The S4 gallop rhythm may indicate left ventricular dysfunction in the setting of septic shock.

Question
A 65-year-old male patient presents to his GP with a skin lesion on his left cheek that has been present for the last few months. The lesion is painless and non-itchy, but it bleeds occasionally when he shaves. On examination, there is a 1 cm diameter, well-circumscribed, dome-shaped papule with central ulceration and telangiectasia. There are no palpable lymph nodes in the neck or elsewhere. The patient has a history of sun exposure due to his outdoor job as a construction worker.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Seborrheic keratosis
B. Squamous cell carcinoma
C. Basal cell carcinoma
D. Melanoma
E. Kaposi's sarcoma

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical features suggest basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which is the most common type of skin cancer worldwide and typically occurs on sun-exposed areas such as the face and neck in older adults with fair skin. BCCs may have various morphologies including nodular, superficial, pigmented, cystic or morpheaform types; however, they usually have a pearly appearance with rolled edges and telangiectasia on dermoscopy.

Question
A 30-year-old female patient attends her GP surgery complaining of an itchy rash that started on her arms around two weeks ago before spreading to involve her trunk and legs over time. She reports feeling unwell with flu-like symptoms at onset but denies any recent travel or contact with sick individuals. On examination, there are multiple erythematous macules and papules coalescing into plaques with central clearing on her chest and back along with some excoriations from scratching.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pityriasis rosea 
B. Erythema multiforme 
C. Drug eruption
D. Scabies infestation 
E. Secondary syphilis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features suggest pityriasis rosea (PR), which is a common self-limiting skin condition that typically affects young adults in the spring and autumn seasons with an unknown viral cause. PR presents as a herald patch followed by multiple oval or annular lesions arranged along the lines of cleavage on the trunk, which may be pruritic but not painful or scaly. The diagnosis can be confirmed by histopathology showing mild spongiosis and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.

Question
A 55-year-old male patient attends his GP surgery for a routine check-up and mentions a new mole he has noticed on his left arm recently that seems to have changed in size and colour over time. On examination, there is a 0.5 cm diameter irregularly pigmented macule with asymmetrical borders and variegated colours including brown, black, red and white.
What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Reassurance only
B. Cryotherapy
C. Excision biopsy
D. Topical imiquimod cream
E. Observation with serial photography

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical features raise suspicion for melanoma, which is a potentially life-threatening type of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes in the epidermis or dermis and can metastasize to other organs if not detected early enough. Melanomas are characterized by the ABCDE criteria of asymmetry, border irregularity, colour variation, diameter >6 mm and evolution over time; however, some melanomas may lack one or more of these features or mimic benign moles such as dysplastic nevi (DN). Therefore, any suspicious lesion should be excised with adequate margins for histological evaluation to confirm or exclude malignancy.

Question
A 45-year-old male patient presents with a subcutaneous lump on his right thigh that has been slowly growing in size over the past year. He reports no pain or discomfort, but is concerned about the cosmetic appearance of the lump. On examination, a 5 x 5 cm firm and mobile mass is noted in the subcutaneous tissue of the right thigh. The overlying skin appears normal, without any signs of inflammation or discoloration.

Which imaging modality would be most appropriate for further evaluation? 

A. X-ray
B. Ultrasound
C. CT scan
D. MRI
E. PET scan

Correct Answer: D (MRI)

Explanation: MRI is considered to be the gold standard for soft tissue imaging due to its superior resolution and ability to differentiate between different types of tissues based on their signal intensity characteristics.

Question
A 32-year-old female patient presents with a painful lump on her left breast that she noticed while performing self-examination at home. She reports no family history of breast cancer and has never had any breast surgeries before. On examination, there is a palpable mass measuring approximately 2 x 2 cm in size located in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The mass feels firm and irregular, with poorly defined borders.

What would be the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Referral for mammography and ultrasound
B. Immediate referral to oncology for biopsy
C. Prescribe antibiotics for mastitis 
D. Watchful waiting approach with follow-up appointment scheduled in one month 
E. Surgical excision of the lump

Correct Answer: A (Referral for mammography and ultrasound)

Explanation: Mammography and ultrasound are typically used as initial diagnostic tools when evaluating patients with breast lumps or masses, as they can help identify whether the lesion is solid or cystic, which can guide further management decisions.

Question
A 72-year-old male patient presents with a subcutaneous lump on his left arm that has been slowly growing in size over the past year. He reports no pain or discomfort, but is concerned about the possibility of cancer. On examination, a 3 x 3 cm firm and mobile mass is noted in the subcutaneous tissue of the left arm. The overlying skin appears normal, without any signs of inflammation or discoloration.

Which laboratory test would be most appropriate for further evaluation? 

A. Complete blood count (CBC)
B. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
C. C-reactive protein (CRP)
D. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
E. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)

Correct Answer: E (Carcinoembryonic antigen)

Explanation: Elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen can be associated with certain types of cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer. However, it should be noted that elevated levels can also occur in non-cancerous conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or smoking. Further imaging studies and biopsy may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis if CEA levels are elevated.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the GP with a non-healing ulcer on his leg that has been present for several months. The patient reports that he had a similar ulcer in the past, which healed after treatment but recurred at the same site. On examination, there is an irregularly shaped ulcer measuring 5cm x 3cm over the medial aspect of the lower leg with surrounding erythema and induration. There are no palpable pulses in either foot, and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) measurement reveals an ABPI of less than 0.8.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pyoderma gangrenosum
B. Squamous cell carcinoma
C. Arterial ulcer
D. Neuropathic ulcer
E. Venous ulcer

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The history of recurrence, location of the ulcer, absence of pulses and low ABPI suggest arterial insufficiency as the underlying cause.

Question

Question
A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath and confusion. An arterial blood gas (ABG) sample is obtained, which shows:

pH 7.25 (7.35 - 7.45)
pCO2 70 mmHg (35 - 45)
pO2 60 mmHg (80 - 100)
HCO3- 30 mEq/L (22 - 26)

What is the most likely acid-base abnormality? What is the underlying mechanism? Which compensatory mechanism has been activated? How would you manage this patient?

A. Respiratory acidosis; hypoventilation; metabolic compensation; non-invasive ventilation
B. Metabolic alkalosis; vomiting-induced loss of gastric acid; respiratory compensation; intravenous fluids
C. Metabolic acidosis; lactic acidosis due to sepsis; respiratory compensation; antibiotics and fluid resuscitation
D. Respiratory alkalosis; hyperventilation due to anxiety or pain; metabolic compensation; reassurance and analgesia
E. Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis; diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with COPD exacerbation; renal compensation for metabolic acidosis and respiratory compensation for respiratory acidosis, insulin therapy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The ABG values indicate that this patient has respiratory acidosis, as evidenced by low pH and high pCO2 levels outside the normal range. This could be due to hypoventilation caused by his COPD exacerbation. To compensate for the increased CO2 retention, there will be an increase in bicarbonate production leading to metabolic compensation, as demonstrated by elevated HCO3- levels within the normal range. The body also activates its respiratory compensatory mechanism through increased breathing rate and depth to eliminate excess CO2 from the body. Management of this patient would involve non-invasive ventilation to improve oxygenation and reduce CO2 retention.

Question
A 35-year-old woman with a history of bulimia nervosa presents to her GP with complaints of fatigue, muscle weakness and palpitations. She reports purging episodes after binge eating for several years. An arterial blood gas (ABG) sample is obtained, which shows:

pCO2 30 mmHg (35 - 45)
pO2 90 mmHg (80 - 100)
HCO3- 24 mEq/L (22 - 26)

What is the most likely acid-base abnormality? What is the underlying mechanism? Which compensatory mechanism has been activated? How would you manage this patient?

A. Respiratory alkalosis; hyperventilation due to anxiety or pain; metabolic compensation; cognitive behavioural therapy
B. Metabolic alkalosis; vomiting-induced loss of gastric acid; respiratory compensation; intravenous fluids
C. Respiratory alkalosis; hyperventilation due to salicylate toxicity; metabolic compensation; supportive care and monitoring
D. Metabolic acidosis; lactic acidosis due to sepsis; respiratory compensation; antibiotics and fluid resuscitation
E. Mixed metabolic and respiratory alkalosis; chronic purging leading to loss of hydrogen ions from stomach contents causing metabolic alkalosis, hyperventilation causing respiratory alkalosis, no compensatory mechanism activated yet, referral for psychiatric evaluation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The ABG values indicate that this patient has mixed metabolic and respiratory alkalosis, as evidenced by high pH levels outside the normal range along with low pCO2 levels indicating respiratory alkalosis and HCO3- levels within the normal range indicating metabolic alkalosis caused by chronic purging leading to loss of hydrogen ions from stomach contents. There is no compensatory mechanism activated yet, as the pH levels are outside the normal range and HCO3- levels are within the normal range. Management of this patient would involve referral for psychiatric evaluation and treatment of her bulimia nervosa.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease presents to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath, confusion and weakness. An arterial blood gas (ABG) sample is obtained, which shows:

pCO2 50 mmHg (35 - 45)
pO2 70 mmHg (80 - 100)
HCO3- 24 mEq/L (22 - 26)

What is the most likely acid-base abnormality? What is the underlying mechanism? Which compensatory mechanism has been activated? How would you manage this patient?

A. Respiratory acidosis; hypoventilation due to COPD exacerbation; metabolic compensation; non-invasive ventilation
B. Metabolic alkalosis; vomiting-induced loss of gastric acid; respiratory compensation; intravenous fluids
C. Metabolic acidosis; lactic acidosis due to sepsis; respiratory compensation; antibiotics and fluid resuscitation
D. Respiratory acidosis; hypoventilation due to opioid overdose or sedative use in a patient with chronic kidney disease leading to decreased drug clearance, renal compensation for metabolic acidosis, naloxone administration if indicated
E. Mixed metabolic and respiratory alkalosis; hyperventilation due to anxiety or pain causing respiratory alkalosis, diuretic therapy causing metabolic alkalosis, no compensatory mechanism activated yet, cessation of diuretics

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The ABG values indicate that this patient has respiratory acidosis, as evidenced by low pH levels outside the normal range and high pCO2 levels indicating hypoventilation. This could be due to opioid overdose or sedative use in a patient with chronic kidney disease leading to decreased drug clearance. To compensate for the respiratory acidosis, there will be an increase in bicarbonate production leading to metabolic compensation, as demonstrated by HCO3- levels within the normal range. The body also activates its renal compensatory mechanism through increased excretion of hydrogen ions and reabsorption of bicarbonate ions to correct metabolic acidosis caused by respiratory acidosis. Management of this patient would involve naloxone administration if indicated and supportive care including non-invasive ventilation if necessary.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with a history of progressive hearing loss in her left ear over the past year, accompanied by occasional episodes of vertigo and tinnitus. An audiogram reveals severe sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear, while the right ear is normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirms the presence of an acoustic neuroma on the left side.
Which one of the following is true regarding the management of this patient? 
A. Observation alone is recommended for tumours smaller than 2 cm
B. Stereotactic radiosurgery should be considered as first-line treatment for all patients with acoustic neuromas
C. Microsurgical resection is indicated only if there is evidence of tumour growth or significant neurological symptoms
D. The choice between observation, stereotactic radiosurgery, and microsurgical resection depends primarily on patient preference
E. All patients with acoustic neuromas require immediate surgical intervention

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Management options for acoustic neuromas depend on various factors such as tumour size, location, rate of growth, and severity of symptoms. For small tumours (<2 cm), observation alone may be appropriate; however, larger tumours or those causing significant neurological deficits usually require some form of active treatment. While stereotactic radiosurgery has gained popularity as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery, it may not be suitable for all patients due to potential risks and limitations associated with this technique. Microsurgical resection remains a viable option for many patients with acoustic neuromas, especially those who have experienced rapid progression of symptoms or have large or complex tumours.

Question
A 48-year-old man presents with sudden onset dizziness and vomiting that occurred while he was driving his car earlier today. He reports feeling unsteady when walking and having difficulty maintaining balance when standing still. On examination, you note horizontal nystagmus and mild left-sided hearing loss. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain reveals a small acoustic neuroma on the right side.
Which one of the following is true regarding the pathophysiology of vestibular dysfunction in this patient? 
A. The tumour compresses the cochlear nerve, leading to impaired sound transmission
B. The tumour causes inflammation and demyelination of the vestibular nerve fibres
C. The tumour disrupts the normal flow of endolymph within the semicircular canals
D. The tumour induces abnormal firing patterns in the central vestibular pathways
E. The tumour damages the otolith organs, impairing detection of linear acceleration

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Vestibular dysfunction is a common feature of acoustic neuromas due to their location adjacent to the vestibulocochlear nerve complex. While hearing loss typically results from compression or infiltration of cochlear structures by the tumour, vestibular symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness, and imbalance are thought to arise from disruption of normal vestibular function. One proposed mechanism for this effect involves abnormal stimulation or inhibition of central vestibular pathways by aberrant signals arising from damaged or compressed peripheral vestibular structures.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a three-month history of progressive hearing loss in her left ear, accompanied by tinnitus and occasional episodes of vertigo that have become more frequent over time. An audiogram confirms severe sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear, while an MRI scan shows a large acoustic neuroma measuring 3 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm on the left side.
Which one of the following is true regarding potential complications associated with surgical resection? 
A. Damage to cranial nerves III-VI may occur due to proximity to these structures during surgery
B. Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a common complication that requires immediate intervention
C. Meningitis is a rare but serious complication that may occur due to contamination of the surgical field
D. Postoperative hearing loss is an inevitable consequence of acoustic neuroma surgery, regardless of tumour size or location
E. Recurrence of the tumour after complete resection is uncommon and usually indicates aggressive histology

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Microsurgical resection remains a viable option for many patients with acoustic neuromas, especially those who have experienced rapid progression of symptoms or have large or complex tumours. However, this procedure carries significant risks and potential complications, including damage to adjacent cranial nerves such as III-VI, which can result in diplopia, ptosis, and other ophthalmic deficits. Other potential complications include postoperative CSF leak, meningitis, wound infection, and cerebellar haematoma. While recurrence rates vary depending on various factors such as tumour size and histology, long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for disease progression or recurrence.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP with a painful, swollen left breast that has been gradually worsening over the past week.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department after witnessing a fatal car accident on his way to work. He describes feeling helpless and overwhelmed as he watched the incident unfold, and has been experiencing flashbacks of the event since it occurred three days ago. He reports difficulty sleeping, irritability, and increased startle response. The patient denies any past psychiatric history or substance use.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?

A. Prescribe benzodiazepines for short-term relief
B. Refer for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
C. Administer propranolol to reduce hyperarousal symptoms
D. Admit to inpatient psychiatric unit for observation
E. Encourage self-care measures such as exercise and relaxation techniques

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Benzodiazepines are not recommended as first-line treatment due to their potential for dependence and worsening of symptoms over time. Referral for CBT may be beneficial in the long term but is not an immediate intervention. Propranolol may be used in some cases but should be avoided in patients with asthma or heart failure. Inpatient admission is not necessary unless there is a risk of harm to self or others. Encouraging self-care measures such as exercise and relaxation techniques can help manage acute stress reactions.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of nightmares and anxiety following a traumatic experience during childbirth two weeks ago. She had a prolonged labor which resulted in an emergency caesarean section under general anesthesia due to fetal distress, followed by postpartum hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion and surgical intervention.

The patient reports feeling disconnected from her baby, avoiding reminders of the birth experience, and having intrusive thoughts about what could have gone wrong during delivery.

Which one of the following interventions would be most appropriate at this stage? 

A. Start antidepressant medication
B. Refer for psychotherapy 
C. Encourage social support from family and friends
D. Prescribe benzodiazepines for short-term relief
E. Monitor symptoms and reassess in 4 weeks

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient is likely experiencing acute stress disorder, which typically resolves within a month without intervention. Antidepressant medication may be considered if symptoms persist beyond this time frame or if there are comorbid mood disorders. Psychotherapy can also be helpful but may not be necessary at this stage. Social support should always be encouraged but is unlikely to resolve the patient's symptoms on its own. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided due to their potential for dependence.

B. LSIL is a benign finding that does not require any further action.
C. LSIL can be caused by hormonal changes or inflammation rather than HPV infection.
D. LSIL always progresses to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs).
E. LSIL requires immediate referral for colposcopy.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: LSIL refers to mild cellular abnormalities seen on cervical cytology that may indicate early changes associated with HPV infection but are unlikely to progress to cervical cancer. LSIL can also be caused by hormonal changes or inflammation, and most cases will resolve without treatment.

Question
A 40-year-old woman presents for routine cervical screening, and her sample returns positive for HPV with no abnormal cytology findings. She has a history of smoking and is currently taking oral contraceptives.

What is the recommended management plan? 

A. Repeat HPV testing in 6 months
B. Referral for colposcopy 
C. Return to routine recall every 3 years
D. Offer HPV vaccination 
E. Repeat sample in 12 months

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In women over the age of 30, a positive HPV test with negative cytology results indicates transient infection that may clear on its own within six months to one year. Therefore, repeat HPV testing in six months is recommended before considering referral for colposcopy or further investigation. Smoking and oral contraceptive use are known risk factors for persistent HPV infection and should be addressed during counseling sessions.

Question
A 32-year-old male presents with a history of chronic back pain and stiffness for the past year. The pain is worse in the morning and improves with exercise. He has no other significant medical history, but his father was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis at a young age. On examination, there is limited lumbar spine movement, and he has decreased chest expansion on deep breathing. Blood tests reveal elevated inflammatory markers, and X-rays show sacroiliitis.

Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most useful to confirm the diagnosis? 

A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine
B. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis
C. Ultrasound of the sacroiliac joints
D. Bone scintigraphy
E. Plain radiographs of the thoracic spine

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: MRI is considered the gold standard for diagnosing early stages of ankylosing spondylitis as it can detect inflammation before structural damage occurs.

Question
A 27-year-old female presents with lower back pain that started six months ago after she gave birth to her first child via vaginal delivery without any complications. She reports that her symptoms have been gradually worsening over time, especially during periods of rest or inactivity, and are relieved by physical activity or exercise. She also complains of fatigue and generalized joint pain involving both knees and ankles.

On examination, there is tenderness over her sacroiliac joints bilaterally, reduced spinal mobility in all planes, and mild swelling over both knees and ankles without erythema or warmth.

Which one of the following laboratory investigations would be most helpful in confirming this patient's diagnosis? 

A. Rheumatoid factor (RF)
B. Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
C. C-reactive protein (CRP)
D. Human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27)
E. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: HLA-B27 is a genetic marker that is strongly associated with ankylosing spondylitis, and its presence can help confirm the diagnosis in patients who present with clinical features suggestive of the disease.

Question
A 30-year-old male presents to his general practitioner with complaints of chronic lower back pain for the past two years. He reports that his symptoms are worse in the morning and improve with exercise or physical activity.

Explanation: Benzodiazepines are not recommended as first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder due to their potential for dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms. They may be used as adjunctive therapy in some cases but should not be used as monotherapy.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She has a history of cholecystitis and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy six months ago. On examination, she is tender in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. An ultrasound scan shows dilatation of the common bile duct (CBD) and an impacted stone at the distal end of CBD.
Which one of the following interventions should be performed as soon as possible? 

A. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
B. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC)
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
D. Computed tomography (CT) scan
E. Repeat laparoscopic exploration

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests choledocholithiasis, which requires urgent intervention to prevent complications such as ascending cholangitis or pancreatitis. ERCP is usually preferred for removing stones from CBD; however, it may not be feasible in this case due to prior surgery and impacted stone location. PTC can provide access to biliary system via percutaneous route, allowing removal of stones by basket extraction or lithotripsy.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to his back for several months associated with nausea and vomiting after meals. He also reports intolerance to fatty foods and weight loss over the past few weeks despite having a good appetite.
On examination, he appears jaundiced with tenderness in the epigastric region.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute pancreatitis
B. Chronic gastritis
C. Peptic ulcer disease
D. Cholelithiasis 
E. Pancreatic cancer

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and signs suggest pancreatic cancer, which commonly presents with painless jaundice, weight loss, anorexia and epigastric tenderness. Cholelithiasis may cause similar symptoms but is less likely to present with jaundice or significant weight loss. Acute pancreatitis can also cause severe abdominal pain radiating to the back but typically resolves within a few days. Chronic gastritis or peptic ulcer disease usually do not cause jaundice.

Question
A 65-year-old woman undergoes laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis complicated by empyema of gallbladder. Intraoperatively, the surgeon notes that the cystic duct is short and wide, making it difficult to secure during dissection.
Which one of the following complications is most likely? 

A. Bile leak
B. Common bile duct injury
C. Duodenal perforation
D. Pancreatitis 
E. Abdominal abscess

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Short and wide cystic duct increases the risk of incomplete ligation or clip slippage leading to bile leak from the biliary tree into peritoneum or subhepatic space causing postoperative fever, abdominal pain and raised inflammatory markers. Common bile duct injury is rare in laparoscopic cholecystectomy but can occur due to misidentification or transection of CBD instead of cystic duct/artery resulting in bile leakage, jaundice and sepsis requiring urgent intervention such as ERCP or PTC drainage. Duodenal perforation can occur if there is inadvertent thermal injury during electrocautery near duodenum causing delayed presentation with peritonitis and sepsis; however, this complication is uncommon in experienced hands. Pancreatitis may occur if there is manipulation or trauma to the pancreatic duct or sphincter of Oddi during dissection leading to elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, abdominal pain and vomiting. Abdominal abscess is a rare complication that may occur due to intraoperative contamination or postoperative infection requiring drainage.

Question
A 32-year-old veteran of the Iraq War presents to his GP with symptoms of anxiety, including recurrent nightmares and flashbacks of traumatic events during his deployment. He reports feeling on edge and easily startled, avoiding situations that remind him of his experiences, and having difficulty sleeping and concentrating. The patient also admits to self-medicating with alcohol to cope with his symptoms.
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute stress disorder
B. Generalized anxiety disorder
C. Panic disorder with agoraphobia
D. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
E. Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD, which can occur after exposure to traumatic events such as combat or sexual assault.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP reporting intrusive thoughts about a car accident she was involved in six months ago, where she witnessed the death of another driver.

Explanation: Timolol belongs to the beta-blocker class of medications which can cause systemic side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and fatigue. In this case, switching to a different class of topical glaucoma medication such as prostaglandin analogues or alpha-agonists would be an appropriate next step in management.

Question
A 78-year-old woman with a history of primary open-angle glaucoma presents to her optometrist complaining of worsening vision despite compliance with her prescribed eye drops (timolol and latanoprost). Her intraocular pressures are found to be elevated bilaterally despite maximal medical therapy.

What would be an appropriate next step in management? 

A. Increase dosage of current medications
B. Add another topical medication from a different class
C. Perform laser trabeculoplasty 
D. Refer for incisional surgery 
E. Repeat visual field testing

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: When maximum tolerated medical therapy fails to control intraocular pressure, surgical intervention is indicated. Incisional surgery such as trabeculectomy or tube shunt implantation may be considered in this case.

Question
A 70-year-old man with a history of primary open-angle glaucoma presents to his ophthalmologist for routine follow-up. He reports that he has been experiencing difficulty administering his eye drops due to hand tremors and poor vision. On examination, the patient's visual acuity is found to have deteriorated since his last visit.

What would be an appropriate next step in management? 

A. Refer for occupational therapy 
B. Switch to preservative-free eye drops
C. Prescribe oral medication instead of topical drops
D. Perform laser trabeculoplasty 
E. Refer for incisional surgery

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients who are unable to administer topical medications effectively, oral medications may be considered as an alternative option for controlling intraocular pressure. However, it is important to consider potential systemic side effects and drug interactions when prescribing oral medications for glaucoma management.

Question
A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and smoking presents to the clinic for his routine check-up. His abdominal ultrasound reveals an aortic aneurysm measuring 6 cm in diameter. The patient is referred to the vascular surgeon for further management. Which of the following factors should be considered when deciding on the appropriate treatment option? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of open surgical repair versus endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in this patient.

A. Open surgical repair has a higher risk of immediate post-operative complications, such as bleeding and infection.
B. EVAR may not be feasible if there are significant anatomical variations or calcification within the aorta.
C. Long-term durability of EVAR is uncertain, with potential risks of graft migration or endoleak.
D. Open surgical repair requires longer hospitalization and recovery time compared to EVAR.
E. Both options carry similar long-term mortality rates.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In this patient with a large abdominal aortic aneurysm, both open surgical repair and EVAR are viable treatment options that need to be carefully considered based on individual patient characteristics and preferences. While open surgical repair has been traditionally used for larger aneurysms, it carries higher perioperative morbidity and mortality rates than EVAR, which is less invasive but may have lower long-term durability due to potential complications such as graft migration or endoleak.

Question
A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset severe back pain radiating towards her abdomen. She reports feeling lightheaded and dizzy upon standing up from bed earlier that morning but did not seek medical attention until now due to worsening symptoms. On examination, she appears pale and diaphoretic with a pulsatile mass palpable in her abdomen extending from below the xiphoid process down towards her pelvis. Her blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, and her heart rate is 110 beats per minute. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be ordered immediately? Discuss the management options for this patient.

A. CT angiography of the chest and abdomen
B. Transthoracic echocardiogram
C. Abdominal ultrasound
D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine
E. Chest X-ray

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which requires urgent diagnosis and treatment to prevent further complications such as hemorrhagic shock or organ failure. The most appropriate initial diagnostic test in this scenario would be CT angiography of the chest and abdomen to assess the extent of the aneurysm rupture and guide subsequent management decisions, including surgical repair or endovascular intervention if feasible.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of intermittent lower back pain that radiates towards his legs over the past few months. He reports no other significant medical history but admits to being a heavy smoker for several decades. On examination, there are no focal neurological deficits, but there is tenderness upon palpation over his lumbar spine region without any signs of infection or inflammation. An abdominal ultrasound reveals a small infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring 3 cm in diameter. Which of the following factors should be considered when deciding on follow-up monitoring? Discuss the natural history and risk stratification for patients with small asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms.

A. Smoking cessation counseling should be provided as part of routine care.
B. Annual surveillance imaging with either ultrasound or CT scan is recommended.
C. Risk stratification based on size, growth rate, and comorbidities can help determine optimal management strategies.
D. Surgical repair may be indicated if the aneurysm grows beyond 5 cm in diameter or if there are signs of rupture.
E. Conservative management with regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications may be appropriate for low-risk patients.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Small asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are often detected incidentally on imaging studies performed for other indications, such as routine physical exams or screening tests. The natural history of AAAs is characterized by slow growth over time, but the risk of rupture increases significantly once the aneurysm reaches a certain size threshold (>5 cm). Therefore, risk stratification based on factors such as age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, and aneurysm characteristics (size, shape, location) can help guide optimal management strategies ranging from conservative surveillance to surgical repair or endovascular intervention.

Question
A 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents to the clinic for follow-up after being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3a six months ago. His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has remained stable at 50 ml/min/1.7m2, but his urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) has increased from 30 mg/mmol to 300 mg/mmol over the same period. He denies any symptoms such as dysuria or hematuria, but reports occasional lower back pain. Physical examination is unremarkable except for mild tenderness on palpation of the right flank.
Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate to evaluate this patient's renal function? 

A. Renal biopsy
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
C. Computed tomography (CT) scan
D. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)
E. Ultrasound

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: MRI is considered the gold standard for evaluating renal function in patients with CKD due to its ability to provide detailed information about renal blood flow, perfusion, and oxygenation without exposing patients to ionizing radiation.

Question
A 56-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath that have been worsening over several weeks despite increasing her diuretic medication for edema associated with her chronic kidney disease (CKD). She also reports decreased appetite and nausea over the past few days along with a metallic taste in her mouth.
Laboratory tests reveal a serum potassium level of 6 mmol/L, serum bicarbonate level of 18 mmol/L, serum creatinine level of 4 mg/dL, and anemia with hemoglobin level of 9 g/dL.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? 

A. Hyperkalemia
B. Metabolic acidosis
C. Uremic encephalopathy 
D. Iron deficiency anemia 
E. Hypertensive emergency

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with metabolic acidosis, which is a common complication of CKD due to impaired renal excretion of acids and retention of hydrogen ions.

Question
A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 presents to the clinic for follow-up after being diagnosed with prostate cancer six months ago. He underwent radical prostatectomy followed by radiation therapy and has been on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) since then.
Which one of the following medications should be avoided in this patient? 

A. Spironolactone
B. Furosemide
C. Calcium carbonate 
D. Allopurinol 
E. Acetaminophen

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Spironolactone is contraindicated in patients receiving ADT due to its anti-androgenic effects, which can lead to feminization and gynecomastia in men as well as decreased efficacy of ADT for prostate cancer treatment.

Question
A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain radiating through to his back. He has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia but no other abnormalities. CT scan reveals an aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta, arch, and descending thoracic aorta. His condition is stable at the moment, other than a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient? Should he undergo surgery? If so, what type? What are the potential complications? How should his blood pressure be managed? What medications should be used?

A. Control blood pressure with labetalol then perform open surgical repair
B. Control blood pressure with nicardipine then perform endovascular stent grafting
C. Perform emergent open surgical repair regardless of blood pressure control
D. Perform endovascular stent grafting regardless of blood pressure control
E. Conservative management with strict blood pressure control

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient requires urgent intervention due to involvement of both the ascending and descending thoracic aorta in addition to hypertension which increases risk of rupture or extension of dissection into vital organs such as brain or kidneys leading to stroke or renal failure respectively. The optimal treatment depends on multiple factors including location, extent and timing of presentation among others; however, in general terms, patients presenting within first 24 hours benefit from open surgical repair while those beyond that time frame may require endovascular stenting instead if they meet certain criteria such as absence of malperfusion syndrome or rupture signs etcetera.

Question
A 48-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of intermittent episodes of chest pain over last few weeks along with shortness of breath and fatigue on exertion. She has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. On examination, her blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg in both arms with a regular pulse of 70 beats per minute. There are no murmurs or other abnormalities noted on cardiac exam.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What tests should be ordered? How should this condition be managed? What are the potential complications? 

A. Stable angina
B. Unstable angina
C. Myocardial infarction
D. Aortic stenosis
E. Aortic dissection

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient's symptoms could suggest several different diagnoses including coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease or aortic pathology such as aneurysm or dissection among others; however, given the sudden onset of chest pain along with shortness of breath and fatigue on exertion, aortic dissection must be considered high on differential diagnosis list especially if there are any risk factors present such as hypertension or connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome etcetera. Imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI can confirm the diagnosis while medical management involves strict blood pressure control to prevent further extension of dissection into vital organs leading to catastrophic consequences.

Question
A 56-year-old man presents to his cardiologist for follow-up after undergoing successful surgical repair for type A aortic dissection two years ago. He has been compliant with all medications including beta blockers and ACE inhibitors since then but reports occasional episodes of chest pain over last few months which he attributes to stress at work.

What is the most likely cause of his current symptoms? What tests should be ordered? How should this condition be managed? What are the potential complications?

A. Recurrent aortic dissection
B. Coronary artery disease
C. Valvular heart disease
D. Pulmonary embolism 
E. Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's symptoms could suggest several different diagnoses including recurrent aortic dissection, valvular heart disease or even pulmonary embolism among others; however, given the history of successful surgical repair for type A aortic dissection two years ago along with compliance with medications since then, coronary artery disease must be considered high on differential diagnosis list especially if there are any risk factors present such as smoking or diabetes etcetera. Imaging studies such as stress test or angiography can confirm the diagnosis while medical management involves optimization of anti-anginal therapy and lifestyle modifications to prevent further progression of disease leading to myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing for the past week. He has a history of heavy smoking for over 40 years and was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) five years ago. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air, and he appears to be in respiratory distress. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms and increased retrosternal airspace. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals pH 7.32, pCO2 64 mmHg, pO2 52 mmHg, HCO3- 30 mEq/L.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. High-flow nasal cannula therapy
B. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)
C. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation
D. Inhaled bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids
E. Antibiotic therapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation suggests an acute exacerbation of COPD with respiratory failure requiring urgent intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation while avoiding invasive mechanical ventilation if possible due to his underlying lung disease. The most appropriate initial management would be non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which has been shown to reduce mortality rates in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD by improving gas exchange and reducing work of breathing.

Question
A 58-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of persistent cough productive of yellow sputum for the past six months that worsens during cold weather or exposure to irritants at work where she works as a hairdresser. She also reports increasing shortness of breath on exertion but denies any chest pain or hemoptysis. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and obesity, and she has a 25 pack-year smoking history. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds and prolonged expiration with wheezing on auscultation, but no cyanosis or clubbing.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chronic bronchitis
B. Emphysema
C. Asthma
D. Bronchiectasis
E. Lung cancer

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with chronic bronchitis, which is defined as cough productive of sputum for at least three months in each of two consecutive years in the absence of any other identifiable cause. The condition is typically associated with exposure to cigarette smoke or occupational irritants and results in inflammation and narrowing of the airways leading to airflow limitation, mucus hypersecretion, and recurrent respiratory infections.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his pulmonologist for follow-up after being diagnosed with severe COPD six months ago based on spirometry testing that showed an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.35 and post-bronchodilator FEV1 of 30% predicted. He reports worsening dyspnea on exertion despite using his inhalers regularly and experiencing frequent exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and antibiotics over the past few months.

What would be the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Increase dose or frequency of current inhaler therapy
B. Add long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) to current regimen
C. Refer for pulmonary rehabilitation program
D. Consider surgical intervention such as lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS)
E. Initiate home oxygen therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's severe COPD symptoms despite maximal medical therapy suggest consideration for more invasive interventions such as LVRS, which involves removing damaged parts of the lungs to improve breathing capacity by reducing hyperinflation while preserving lung function. The procedure has been shown to improve survival rates and quality of life in carefully selected patients with severe COPD who have failed medical management.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C infection presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, jaundice, and confusion. On examination, he has asterixis and fetor hepaticus. His liver function tests reveal elevated bilirubin and transaminases. An ultrasound shows cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension.

Which one of the following is most likely to be responsible for his current presentation? 

A. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
B. Hepatocellular carcinoma 
C. Acute alcoholic hepatitis 
D. Portal vein thrombosis 
E. Budd-Chiari syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute decompensation of cirrhosis, which can be caused by various complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). SBP occurs when bacteria from the gut translocate into ascitic fluid in patients with cirrhosis, leading to an inflammatory response that can cause fever, abdominal pain, and altered mental status.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of fatigue and weight loss over the past few months. She has a history of alcohol abuse but quit drinking several years ago after being diagnosed with fatty liver disease.

He also reports nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. On examination, there is tenderness in the RLQ with guarding and rebound tenderness. Blood tests reveal an elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein level.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute appendicitis
B. Chronic appendicitis
C. Diverticulitis 
D. Inflammatory bowel disease 
E. Colorectal cancer

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Chronic appendicitis is a rare condition that presents with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain similar to acute appendicitis but without the characteristic signs of inflammation such as fever or leukocytosis. It can be difficult to diagnose due to its nonspecific symptoms and may require imaging studies for confirmation.

Question
A 45-year-old female patient presents with chronic diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating for the past 5 years. She has a history of iron deficiency anaemia and osteoporosis. The patient underwent small bowel biopsy which showed villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia consistent with coeliac disease. She was started on a gluten-free diet but her symptoms persisted despite adherence to the diet. Further investigations revealed that she had refractory coeliac disease (RCD). Which one of the following is true regarding RCD? 

A. It is characterised by complete resolution of symptoms with a gluten-free diet.
B. It occurs in patients who have been diagnosed with coeliac disease for less than 1 year.
C. Type I RCD is characterised by clonal expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) without evidence of malignancy.
D. Type II RCD is characterised by monoclonal expansion of IELs and carries a good prognosis.
E. Treatment options include immunosuppressive therapy such as corticosteroids.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is defined as persistent or recurrent malabsorptive symptoms and/or villous atrophy despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet for more than 12 months, after excluding other causes such as lactose intolerance, pancreatic insufficiency or bacterial overgrowth syndrome. There are two types of RCD; type I which shows polyclonal expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), while type II shows monoclonal expansion of IELs and carries an increased risk of developing enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). Treatment options include immunosuppressive therapy such as corticosteroids, azathioprine or infliximab.

Question
A 32-year-old male patient presents with fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain. He has a history of coeliac disease diagnosed 10 years ago for which he has been following a strict gluten-free diet. On examination, he is noted to have hepatosplenomegaly. Blood tests reveal pancytopenia with the presence of circulating blasts in the peripheral blood smear. Bone marrow biopsy confirms the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Which one of the following is true regarding AML in patients with coeliac disease? 

A. It occurs more commonly in patients who are non-compliant with a gluten-free diet.
B. The risk of developing AML is not increased in patients with coeliac disease.
C. The association between AML and coeliac disease is limited to paediatric population only.
D. Patients with RCD type II are at higher risk of developing AML compared to those with RCD type I or uncomplicated coeliac disease.
E. Treatment options include surgical resection followed by chemotherapy.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: There is an increased risk of haematological malignancies such as lymphoma and leukaemia in patients with coeliac disease, particularly those who have refractory coeliac disease (RCD) type II characterised by monoclonal expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has been reported in patients with RCD type II, but it can also occur in those without RCD or even those who adhere strictly to a gluten-free diet. Treatment options depend on various factors including age, comorbidities and cytogenetics; however, most cases require induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation therapy.

Question
A 55-year-old female patient presents with chronic diarrhoea, weight loss and fatigue for the past year. She was previously diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome but her symptoms persisted despite treatment. Her medical history is significant for coeliac disease diagnosed 20 years ago, which has been well-controlled with a gluten-free diet. Blood tests reveal iron-deficiency anaemia and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies show hepatosplenomegaly and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the enlarged lymph nodes confirms the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma. Which one of the following is true regarding the association between coeliac disease and lymphoma? 

A. The risk of developing lymphoma in patients with coeliac disease is not increased compared to general population.
B. Lymphomas associated with coeliac disease are usually T-cell in origin.
C. Patients with RCD type I have an increased risk of developing enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).
D. Treatment options for follicular lymphoma include surgical resection followed by chemotherapy.
E. Adherence to a gluten-free diet can reduce the risk of developing lymphoma in patients with coeliac disease.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: There is an increased risk of developing both non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphomas in patients with coeliac disease, particularly those who have refractory coeliac disease (RCD) type I characterised by polyclonal expansion of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) is a rare but aggressive form of peripheral T-cell lymphoma that occurs almost exclusively in patients with RCD type I or uncomplicated coeliac disease; it carries a poor prognosis despite treatment including chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Adherence to a strict gluten-free diet may reduce the risk of developing EATL, but it does not eliminate it completely.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a history of sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. On examination, he is found to be hypotensive with an irregularly irregular pulse. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. The patient is diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and started on appropriate treatment. However, his heart rate remains persistently high despite medical therapy.

Which one of the following medications would be most effective in controlling this patient's heart rate? 

A. Amiodarone
B. Digoxin
C. Verapamil
D. Adenosine
E. Metoprolol

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of palpitations that occur intermittently throughout the day for several weeks now. She describes them as episodes of "fluttering" sensation in her chest that last for a few seconds up to several minutes at a time, sometimes accompanied by mild dizziness or lightheadedness but no syncope or chest pain. Her medical history is unremarkable except for occasional migraines which she treats with over-the-counter analgesics.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)
B. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)
C. Sinus arrhythmia
D. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS)
E. Brugada syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), a common arrhythmia characterized by sudden onset and termination of rapid, regular palpitations due to re-entry circuit involving the atrioventricular node or accessory pathway. PSVT can be triggered by various factors such as stress, caffeine, alcohol, or exercise. Treatment options include vagal maneuvers, adenosine, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or catheter ablation.

Question
A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents to his cardiologist for routine follow-up after recent hospitalization for heart failure exacerbation.

What is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms? 

A. Orthostatic hypotension
B. Vasovagal syncope
C. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity
D. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)
E. Long QT syndrome (LQTS)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with orthostatic hypotension which is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure >20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing up from sitting or lying down position. This can be caused by various factors such as autonomic dysfunction, dehydration, medication side effects (e.g., diuretics), or underlying conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Treatment options include lifestyle modifications (e.g., increasing fluid intake), pharmacotherapy (e.g., midodrine), or compression stockings.

Question
A 72-year-old man presents with a history of rectal bleeding and change in bowel habit for the past six months. He has lost approximately 8kg of weight during this time period. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Colonoscopy reveals a large mass located at the sigmoid colon that appears to be invading surrounding structures. Biopsy results confirm adenocarcinoma with lymphovascular invasion. CT scan shows multiple liver metastases but no evidence of distant spread beyond the liver.

Which of the following treatment options would be most appropriate for this patient?

A. Palliative chemotherapy
B. Surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy
C. Radiation therapy alone
D. Targeted therapy with monoclonal antibodies
E. Watchful waiting

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Given the presence of local invasion and distant metastasis, surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy would be the most appropriate treatment option for this patient.

Question
A 57-year-old woman presents with abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation that have been progressively worsening over several months despite dietary modifications and laxatives use without relief of symptoms. Physical examination reveals a palpable mass in the left lower quadrant of her abdomen.

Which of the following genetic tests would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. KRAS mutation testing 
B. BRAF mutation testing 
C. Lynch syndrome screening 
D. TP53 mutation testing 
E. APC gene sequencing 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Given the patient's family history and young age at diagnosis, Lynch syndrome screening would be most appropriate as it is an autosomal dominant condition associated with increased risk of developing colorectal cancer and other malignancies due to germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 gene mutations.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and smoking presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain radiating to his left arm. On examination, he has elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient?

A. Immediate thrombolysis
B. Coronary angiography within 24 hours
C. Urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
D. Conservative medical management
E. Cardiac rehabilitation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which requires urgent reperfusion therapy such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolysis if PCI cannot be performed within 120 minutes of first medical contact. In this case, given that there are no contraindications to immediate transfer for primary PCI, it should be considered as the preferred treatment option over fibrinolysis.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting over the past few weeks. She reports a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) treated with anticoagulation six months ago following surgery for ovarian cancer.

What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Intravenous thrombolysis 
B. Mechanical thrombectomy 
C. Aspirin 300mg stat 
D. Clopidogrel 75mg daily
E. Warfarin

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), mechanical thrombectomy should be considered as first-line treatment if it can be performed within 6 hours of symptom onset or up to 24 hours in selected patients based on advanced imaging criteria. Thrombolysis alone may not be sufficient for LVO strokes, and anticoagulation therapy such as warfarin should be avoided in the acute phase due to increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation.

Question
You are a consultant gastroenterologist working in a tertiary referral centre. A 62-year-old man with known alcoholic liver disease presents to your clinic with progressive abdominal distension and discomfort over the last few weeks. He denies any fever, jaundice or change in bowel habit. On examination, his abdomen is grossly distended with bulging flanks and shifting dullness is present. There is no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or palpable masses. His blood tests reveal hypoalbuminemia and mildly elevated liver enzymes.
Which of the following investigations would be most helpful in determining the etiology of ascites? 

A. CT angiography
B. Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG)
C. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
D. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abdomen

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is calculated by subtracting the albumin concentration in ascitic fluid from that in serum; a value greater than 11 g/L indicates portal hypertension as the cause of ascites while values less than 11 g/L suggest nonportal hypertensive causes such as malignancy, tuberculosis, pancreatic disease or nephrotic syndrome.

Question
You are an emergency department physician assessing a 48-year-old woman who has presented with severe abdominal pain and distension for two days associated with vomiting and constipation but no fever or dysuria.
On examination, her vital signs are stable but she appears uncomfortable due to abdominal tenderness and guarding on palpation along with marked abdominal distension without visible peristalsis.
An urgent plain radiograph of her abdomen reveals dilated loops of small bowel suggestive of obstruction.
What is the most common cause of non-malignant small bowel obstruction? 

A. Adhesions
B. Hernias
C. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
D. Volvulus
E. Intussusception

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Adhesions are the most common cause of non-malignant small bowel obstruction, accounting for up to 75% of cases.

Question
You are a junior doctor working in a hepatology ward and asked to review a 60-year-old man with known cirrhosis who was admitted with worsening ascites over the last few days.

This test can help confirm the diagnosis in this case where exposure to certain plants may be responsible for the patient’s symptoms.

Question
A 56-year-old man with a history of severe asthma presents to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath and chest tightness for the past week. He has been using his inhalers as prescribed but has not found any relief. On examination, he is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing and crackles in the lower lobes. Arterial blood gas analysis shows pH 7.28, pCO2 60 mmHg, and pO2 55 mmHg.

Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial management?

A. Intravenous magnesium sulfate
B. Inhaled salbutamol via nebulizer
C. Oral prednisolone
D. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
E. Endotracheal intubation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's presentation suggests an acute exacerbation of asthma that requires urgent intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation. While all options may be considered in the management of severe asthma exacerbations, NIV is recommended as first-line therapy in patients who are able to tolerate it because it can reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and improve outcomes.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath that have been present for several months despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. She reports frequent nocturnal awakenings due to symptoms and difficulty performing daily activities such as climbing stairs or carrying groceries without becoming short of breath.

What additional diagnostic tests should be ordered at this time? 

A. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan
B. Methacholine challenge test
C. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement
D. Chest X-ray
E. Spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility testing

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's symptoms suggest poorly controlled asthma despite treatment with standard therapies, and additional diagnostic tests are needed to evaluate for possible underlying structural abnormalities or other contributing factors. HRCT scan is recommended as the initial imaging study in patients with suspected severe asthma because it can identify airway remodeling, bronchiectasis, or other structural changes that may require different management strategies.

Question
A 48-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath while at rest. He has a history of smoking and mild intermittent asthma treated with albuterol inhaler as needed. On examination, he is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. ECG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute exacerbation of asthma
B. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
C. Myocardial infarction (MI)
D. Pneumothorax
E. Aortic dissection

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's presentation suggests acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which should be considered in any patient presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath even if they have a history of asthma or other respiratory conditions. PE may also present similarly but would typically have more prominent respiratory symptoms such as pleuritic chest pain or hemoptysis, whereas pneumothorax or aortic dissection would not cause ST elevation on ECG.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding at 34 weeks gestation. On examination, her cervix is found to be fully dilated with a visible umbilical cord in the vagina. The fetal heart rate is bradycardic and there are signs of fetal distress. The obstetrician decides for an emergency caesarean section.
What are the immediate management steps that should be taken? 

A. Administer tocolytics
B. Attempt manual elevation of presenting part
C. Perform artificial amniotomy
D. Place patient in knee-chest position
E. Administer antibiotics

What would be the appropriate management? 

A. Administer tocolytics
B. Attempt manual elevation of presenting part
C. Perform artificial amniotomy
D. Place patient in knee-chest position 
E. Immediate caesarean section

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In cases where there is cervical dilation and effacement with a visible umbilical cord before delivery, immediate caesarean section should be performed as soon as possible to prevent further compression and compromise to fetal circulation.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with a history of chronic cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath that has been gradually worsening over the past few years. He has a significant smoking history of 50 pack-years and was diagnosed with COPD five years ago. Despite using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), his symptoms have not improved significantly. On examination, he has bilateral expiratory wheezes and reduced air entry at the lung bases.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Asthma
B. Chronic bronchitis
C. Emphysema
D. Bronchiectasis
E. Pulmonary fibrosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's history suggests asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS). ACOS is characterized by persistent airflow limitation with features of both asthma and COPD. It is more common in patients who are older, have a significant smoking history, and have had poorly controlled asthma for many years despite treatment with ICS/LABA therapy.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of increasing dyspnea on exertion, productive cough, chest tightness, and wheezing for the past year. She was previously diagnosed with asthma but has never smoked or worked in an environment where she could be exposed to respiratory irritants or pollutants. Her medications include salbutamol inhaler as required and fluticasone/salmeterol combination inhaler twice daily.

On examination, she appears comfortable at rest but has audible expiratory wheezing bilaterally.

Which one of the following tests would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Chest X-ray 
B. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan 
C. Spirometry before and after bronchodilator 
D. Methacholine challenge test 
E. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's history and symptoms suggest ACOS, which is characterized by persistent airflow limitation with features of both asthma and COPD. HRCT scan can help to identify the presence of emphysema or bronchiectasis, which are common in patients with ACOS.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with worsening dyspnea, cough, and fever for the past few days. He has a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years and was diagnosed with COPD five years ago. His medications include tiotropium inhaler once daily and salbutamol inhaler as required.

On examination, he appears uncomfortable at rest, tachypneic with respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, temperature of 38.5°C.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute exacerbation of COPD
B. Pneumonia
C. Pulmonary embolism
D. Congestive heart failure
E. Lung cancer

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests an acute exacerbation of his underlying lung disease; however, given his fever and hypoxia, pneumonia should be considered as well since it is more common in patients with COPD due to impaired immunity and increased susceptibility to infections.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease is admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He requires mechanical ventilation and is started on remdesivir therapy as per hospital protocol. On day 3 of his admission, he develops acute renal failure requiring continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). His serum creatinine level continues to rise despite CVVH therapy.

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Increase the dose of remdesivir
B. Initiate treatment with tocilizumab
C. Discontinue remdesivir therapy
D. Switch to oral anticoagulation therapy
E. Consult nephrology for consideration of renal replacement therapy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient has developed acute kidney injury secondary to COVID-19 infection and requires renal replacement therapy such as CVVH or hemodialysis. Remdesivir does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment but may need to be discontinued if there are concerns about drug toxicity or worsening renal function.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP with persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain three months after recovering from mild COVID-19 infection. She reports that she was previously healthy and had no significant medical history before contracting COVID-19. Physical examination reveals tachycardia and bilateral basal crackles on lung auscultation.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Post-COVID syndrome
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
D. Myocarditis 
E. Pneumothorax 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's symptoms suggest post-COVID syndrome, also known as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). This condition is characterized by persistent symptoms that last for weeks or months after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cognitive impairment.

Question
A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with fever, cough, and dyspnea. He is hypoxic on room air and requires supplemental oxygen therapy. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. He is started on dexamethasone therapy as per hospital protocol.

What is the most important consideration in monitoring this patient's response to treatment?

A. Blood glucose levels
B. Serum electrolyte levels
C. Liver function tests
D. Complete blood count (CBC)
E. Oxygen saturation levels

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Monitoring oxygen saturation levels is crucial in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. Dexamethasone may cause hyperglycemia but does not typically require frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels unless there are concerns about steroid-induced diabetes mellitus or other comorbidities such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or sepsis-associated hyperglycemia. Serum electrolyte levels and liver function tests may be monitored if there are concerns about drug toxicity or worsening organ dysfunction, but these are not specific to COVID-19 management. CBC may show leukopenia or lymphopenia in some patients with COVID-19 but does not provide information on disease severity or response to treatment.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of atopic dermatitis that has been worsening over the past few months. She reports intense itching, especially at night, and areas of redness and scaling on her arms, legs, and trunk. The patient has tried multiple topical treatments in the past without success. On examination, there are areas of erythema with excoriations and lichenification on flexural surfaces as well as papules and vesicles on the trunk.

What is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's eczema?

A. Oral prednisolone
B. Patch testing for allergens
C. Referral to dermatology for phototherapy
D. Topical calcineurin inhibitors e.g tacrolimus or pimecrolimus
E. Wet wrapping

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's worsening eczema may be due to an underlying allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Patch testing can help identify potential allergens triggering the eczema, allowing for targeted avoidance measures or immunomodulatory therapy.

Question
A 10-month-old infant presents to the emergency department with a fever and rapidly worsening rash over his body that started on his face before spreading elsewhere within hours. His mother reports that he had mild eczema previously but it was under control with emollients alone.

Explanation: The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is a pituitary adenoma causing excess secretion of ACTH (Cushing's disease). Other causes include adrenal tumors or hyperplasia, ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors or iatrogenic steroid use. The symptoms of decreased libido and erectile dysfunction are due to the excess cortisol levels causing suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents with complaints of fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight gain. She also reports increased thirst and urination. On examination, you note that she has a round face, buffalo hump on her back, and thin skin with easy bruising. Her blood pressure is elevated at 160/100 mmHg.

Which of the following tests would be most helpful in determining the cause of her symptoms? 

A. Serum potassium level
B. Plasma renin activity 
C. Urinary metanephrine level 
D. Serum aldosterone level 
E. ACTH stimulation test

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presentation is suggestive of Cushing's syndrome which can be caused by various etiologies including pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease), adrenal tumors or hyperplasia, ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors or iatrogenic steroid use. An ACTH stimulation test can help differentiate between these causes as it measures the ability of the adrenal glands to respond to ACTH stimulation; if there is an appropriate rise in cortisol levels after administration of synthetic ACTH then this suggests an adrenal source while lack of response suggests a pituitary or ectopic source.

B. Tadalafil
C. Alfuzosin
D. Solifenacin
E. Mirabegron

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Alpha-blockers are recommended as first-line treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS due to BPH without significant post-void residual urine volume or other complicating factors.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his urologist with bothersome LUTS associated with BPH despite being on alpha-blocker therapy for several months. His IPSS score is 24 and he has a peak flow rate of 8 mL/s on uroflowmetry.
After discussing various treatment options with the patient, it is decided that he will undergo minimally invasive surgery using prostatic urethral lift (PUL).
What is the mechanism of action of PUL? 

A. It destroys prostate tissue through thermal ablation
B. It removes obstructive prostate tissue via transurethral resection
C. It compresses lateral lobes of the prostate gland using permanent implants
D. It vaporizes prostate tissue using laser energy
E. It delivers high-intensity focused ultrasound to destroy prostate tissue

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: PUL is a minimally invasive surgical technique that involves the placement of permanent implants in the lateral lobes of the prostate gland. The implants compress and retract enlarged prostate tissue, thereby opening up the prostatic urethra and improving urinary flow.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his GP with LUTS associated with BPH. He has been on alpha-blocker therapy for several months but reports no improvement in symptoms. His IPSS score is 28 and he has a post-void residual urine volume of 200 mL.
The GP refers him to a urologist who recommends transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
What are some potential complications associated with TURP? 

A. Urinary retention + nausea
B. Dizziness + postural hypotension
C. Urinary urgency + insomnia
D. Erectile dysfunction + reduced libido
E. Retrograde ejaculation + bladder neck contracture

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: TURP is an effective surgical treatment for BPH but can be associated with several complications, including retrograde ejaculation (inability to ejaculate semen through penis), bladder neck contracture (narrowing of the bladder outlet), bleeding, infection, and incontinence.

Question
A 75-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of progressive memory loss over the past year. She has difficulty remembering recent events and frequently misplaces items around the house. Her husband reports that she has become increasingly withdrawn and apathetic, and has lost interest in hobbies that she previously enjoyed. On examination, there is evidence of cognitive impairment on the MMSE (score of 20/30) with particular deficits in recall and attention. MRI brain imaging shows bilateral hippocampal atrophy consistent with Alzheimer's disease.
Which of the following medications is most likely to improve this patient's cognitive function?

A. Donepezil
B. Memantine
C. Rivastigmine
D. Galantamine
E. Tacrine

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor commonly used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, which can improve cognitive function by increasing levels of acetylcholine in the brain.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his GP with concerns about his memory, particularly difficulties recalling names and appointments over the past few months. He also reports feeling more irritable than usual and having trouble sleeping at night. His medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia for which he takes multiple medications including an ACE inhibitor, metformin, and simvastatin.
On examination:
Observations normal
MMSE - 28/30 (mild cognitive impairment)
What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? 

A. Age-related cognitive decline 
B. Vascular dementia 
C. Lewy body dementia 
D. Frontotemporal dementia 
E. Mild cognitive impairment due to medication side effects 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which may be caused by medication side effects. The patient's medical history and medications suggest that this is a possible cause, particularly given the absence of other significant findings on examination.

Question
A 70-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of memory loss and difficulty with language for the past year. She has also noticed changes in her personality, including increased irritability and impulsivity. On examination, there is evidence of cognitive impairment on the MMSE (score of 18/30) with particular deficits in language and executive function. MRI brain imaging shows bilateral frontal lobe atrophy consistent with frontotemporal dementia.
Which of the following features is most characteristic of frontotemporal dementia? 

A. Rapid progression 
B. Prominent visuospatial deficits 
C. Early onset 
D. Memory impairment as an early symptom 
E. Parkinsonism 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Frontotemporal dementia typically presents earlier than Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, often between ages 45-65 years old, and may be associated with prominent behavioural symptoms such as disinhibition, apathy, or compulsive behaviours rather than memory impairment as an early symptom.

Question
A 2-week-old baby presents to the emergency department with his mother, who reports that he has been persistently jaundiced since birth and has not gained weight. On examination, you note hepatomegaly and a palpable gallbladder. An ultrasound scan shows no evidence of biliary obstruction or choledochal cysts but reveals an absent or abnormal gallbladder.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What are the other differential diagnoses? What investigations would you perform? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Biliary atresia
B. Choledochal cyst
C. Neonatal hepatitis
D. Alagille syndrome
E. Cystic fibrosis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical features suggest Alagille syndrome, which is characterized by cholestasis, paucity of bile ducts on liver biopsy, cardiac abnormalities, characteristic facies, skeletal anomalies, and ocular abnormalities. Other differential diagnoses include biliary atresia (which can be excluded by ultrasound), neonatal hepatitis (which can be ruled out by serology), choledochal cyst (which can be excluded by imaging), and cystic fibrosis (which can be diagnosed by sweat chloride test). Investigations should include blood tests for liver function tests and serum bilirubin levels; urine tests for urobilinogen levels; stool tests for fat content; abdominal ultrasound to exclude structural abnormalities; echocardiogram to look for cardiac defects; ophthalmological examination to look for posterior embryotoxon; genetic testing for JAG1 mutations in suspected cases of Alagille syndrome.

Question
A 4-month-old infant presents with persistent jaundice since birth, pale stools, dark urine, and poor weight gain despite adequate feeding. On examination, there is hepatosplenomegaly and a firm cord-like structure felt below the right costal margin. An ultrasound scan shows a dilated common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary radicles, with no evidence of choledochal cysts or gallstones.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What are the other differential diagnoses? How would you confirm the diagnosis? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Biliary atresia
B. Choledochal cyst
C. Neonatal hepatitis
D. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
E. Cystic fibrosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features suggest biliary atresia, which is characterized by progressive cholestasis due to obstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts within the first few months of life. Other differential diagnoses include choledochal cyst (which can be excluded by imaging), neonatal hepatitis (which can be ruled out by serology), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (which can be diagnosed by serum levels and genetic testing), and cystic fibrosis (which can be diagnosed by sweat chloride test). Confirmation of the diagnosis requires a liver biopsy showing absence or paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts, as well as an operative cholangiogram to demonstrate the level and extent of biliary obstruction. Management involves referral to a specialist centre for Kasai portoenterostomy, which aims to restore bile flow from the liver into the intestine.

Question
A 6-year-old child presents with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice over the past year. On examination, there is mild hepatomegaly but no splenomegaly or palpable masses. Blood tests show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What are the other differential diagnoses? What investigations would you perform? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Biliary atresia
B. Choledochal cyst
C. Primary sclerosing cholangitis
D. Caroli disease
E. Cystic fibrosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical features suggest primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bile ducts that leads to progressive biliary obstruction and liver damage. Other differential diagnoses include choledochal cyst (which can be excluded by imaging), Caroli disease (which presents with intrahepatic bile duct dilatation but no extrahepatic obstruction), biliary atresia (which usually presents in infancy), and cystic fibrosis (which can cause obstructive lung disease as well). Investigations should include blood tests for liver function tests, serum bilirubin levels, and autoimmune markers; abdominal ultrasound or MRI to look for biliary abnormalities; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to confirm the diagnosis; liver biopsy to assess the extent of fibrosis and inflammation; colonoscopy to screen for associated inflammatory bowel disease. Management involves symptomatic relief with analgesics, antiemetics, and nutritional support; treatment of complications such as cholangitis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma; consideration of liver transplantation in advanced cases.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents to her GP with a history of depression for the past 5 years. She reports feeling sad, hopeless and helpless most days, with significant weight gain and hypersomnia. The patient has tried multiple antidepressants in the past but none have been effective. On examination, she appears unkempt and disheveled, with poor eye contact and psychomotor retardation. Her mood is depressed, affect blunted and thought process tangential. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Refer for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
B. Prescribe lithium carbonate
C. Order a thyroid function test
D. Increase dose of current antidepressant 
E. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In cases where pharmacotherapy has failed or there is an urgent need to alleviate symptoms such as suicidal ideation or psychosis, ECT can be considered as it has shown to be highly effective in treating severe depression.

Question
A 55-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of low mood over the past month along with decreased appetite, insomnia and feelings of worthlessness due to job loss during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. He denies any thoughts of self-harm or suicide but admits that he feels like giving up on life at times.

Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate initial management? 

A. Start sertraline
B. Refer for psychotherapy 
C. Advise lifestyle modifications 
D. Monitor closely without intervention 
E. Administer benzodiazepines 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Psychotherapy should be offered as first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate depression before considering pharmacological options.

Question
A 21-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a history of self-harm and suicidal ideation. She reports feeling sad, hopeless and worthless for the past year along with decreased appetite, insomnia and poor concentration. On examination, she appears agitated with rapid speech and pressured thoughts. Her mood is depressed, affect labile and thought process tangential. Which of the following would be the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Start fluoxetine 
B. Administer lorazepam
C. Refer for inpatient psychiatric admission
D. Order complete blood count (CBC) 
E. Prescribe olanzapine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Given her high risk of harm to herself, immediate referral for inpatient psychiatric admission is necessary for close monitoring and stabilization of symptoms before considering any other interventions such as pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy.

Question
A 45-year-old man is referred to a psychiatrist by his GP due to concerns about bipolar disorder. The patient reports experiencing periods of elevated mood, which he describes as feeling 'on top of the world'. During these times, he has an increased libido and spends large amounts of money on unnecessary purchases. He also experiences racing thoughts and difficulty sleeping.

However, during his low moods, he feels hopeless and helpless. He has lost interest in activities that previously brought him joy and finds it difficult to concentrate at work. He has had suicidal ideation but denies any plans or attempts.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which he takes medication regularly.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Anxiety disorder
B. Cyclothymia
C. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features
D. Type 1 bipolar affective disorder with mixed features
E. Type 2 bipolar affective disorder

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient meets criteria for type 1 bipolar affective disorder with mixed features as he experiences both manic/hypomanic episodes (elevated mood, increased libido, excessive spending) and depressive episodes (hopelessness, loss of interest). Additionally, the presence of suicidal ideation indicates severity of symptoms.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of insomnia and irritability over the past week. She reports feeling restless and agitated throughout the day despite being tired from lack of sleep at night.

On further questioning, she reveals that she recently started taking fluoxetine prescribed by another doctor for depression but stopped taking it after three days because she felt like it was making her feel worse.

Her family history is significant for bipolar affective disorder in her mother who experienced multiple hospitalizations due to manic episodes.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Adjustment disorder with anxious mood 
B. Generalized anxiety disorder 
C. Hypomanic episode 
D. Major depressive disorder with mixed features
E. Substance-induced mood disorder

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with a hypomanic episode, which can be triggered by antidepressant medication in individuals with underlying bipolar affective disorder. Her family history of bipolar affective disorder also increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his GP for a routine check-up. He reports feeling generally well but mentions that he has been experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past year.

During these times, he feels more confident and outgoing than usual and tends to engage in risky behaviours such as excessive drinking and drug use. However, he denies any psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideation.

On examination, there are no abnormalities detected except for mild hypertension.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cyclothymia 
B. Generalized anxiety disorder 
C. Narcissistic personality disorder 
D. Type 1 bipolar affective disorder without psychotic features
E. Type 2 bipolar affective disorder

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient meets criteria for type 1 bipolar affective disorder without psychotic features as he experiences periods of elevated mood (increased confidence, risk-taking behaviour) without any accompanying psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideation. Mild hypertension may be related to stress associated with manic/hypomanic episodes rather than an independent medical condition.

Question
A 3-year-old boy is brought to the paediatrician by his parents, who are concerned about their child's developmental delay. The parents report that he has not yet started speaking and only makes grunting noises when he wants something.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Dyslexia
B. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
C. Autism spectrum disorder 
D. Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) 
E. Specific language impairment

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features described suggest a diagnosis of specific language impairment, which is characterized by difficulties in expressive or receptive language skills without any other developmental delays or neurological deficits.

Question
A 62-year-old male presents with recurrent bladder cancer after undergoing multiple transurethral resections of the bladder tumour (TURBT). The histopathology report reveals a high-grade muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. He has no significant past medical history but is currently on warfarin for atrial fibrillation. You discuss radical cystectomy as an option, but he expresses concerns about post-operative complications and quality of life.
Which of the following would be an appropriate alternative treatment? 

A. Intravesical chemotherapy
B. Immunotherapy 
C. Radiotherapy alone
D. Active surveillance 
E. Palliative management

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients who are not candidates for radical cystectomy or refuse surgery, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab or atezolizumab can be considered as an alternative treatment option.

Question
A 56-year-old female presents to her GP with symptoms of urgency, frequency and dysuria over the past few weeks. She also reports intermittent haematuria in her urine samples. On examination, there is no palpable mass in the suprapubic region, and digital rectal examination is normal. Urine dipstick analysis shows microscopic haematuria and leukocyturia.
Which one of the following investigations should be performed first? 

A. CT scan abdomen and pelvis
B. Flexible cystoscopy
C. MRI pelvis
D. Ultrasound KUB (kidney-ureter-bladder)
E. Urine cytology

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Ultrasound KUB should be performed initially to assess for any structural abnormalities in the urinary tract that may cause these symptoms before proceeding to further investigations.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with gross painless hematuria for two days duration associated with lower abdominal discomfort and increased urinary frequency without dysuria. He has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both well-controlled with medications. On examination, he is hemodynamically stable with no palpable mass in the suprapubic region or flank tenderness.
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Bladder cancer
B. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
C. Urinary tract infection (UTI)
D. Renal cell carcinoma 
E. Prostate cancer

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Painless gross hematuria is a common presenting symptom of bladder cancer, especially in older individuals with risk factors such as smoking, occupational exposure to certain chemicals, and recurrent UTIs. Further investigations including cystoscopy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and stage the disease accordingly.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of redness, itching, burning sensation around her eyes along with flaky skin on her scalp and eyebrows for several months now. She denies any visual changes or discharge from her eyes but complains about difficulty applying makeup due to dryness around her eyes which worsens throughout the day.
On examination, she has mild erythema at the eyelid margin with scales present over it; otherwise, ocular exam was unremarkable.
What is the MOST LIKELY diagnosis? 

A. Allergic conjunctivitis
B. Seborrhoeic dermatitis
C. Staphylococcal blepharitis
D. Rosacea-associated blepharitis
E. Meibomian gland dysfunction

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with seborrhoeic dermatitis, a common cause of blepharitis that is often associated with flaky skin on the scalp, eyebrows, and other areas of the face.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of redness and irritation in both eyes for several weeks now. He reports that he has been using over-the-counter eye drops but has not noticed any improvement in his symptoms. On examination, there is significant crusting at the eyelid margins with erythema and telangiectasia; otherwise, ocular exam was unremarkable.
Which one of the following is NOT a risk factor for developing blepharitis? 

A. Chronic use of contact lenses
B. Poor hygiene 
C. Rosacea 
D. Diabetes mellitus

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of polyuria and polydipsia for the past year. She has no significant medical history, but her mother was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus at a young age. The patient's serum sodium level is found to be elevated, and she is referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation. After conducting various tests, including a water deprivation test, it is determined that the patient has nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Which one of the following medications would be most effective in treating this patient's symptoms? 

A. Chlorothiazide
B. Desmopressin
C. Furosemide 
D. Hydrochlorothiazide 
E. Spironolactone

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by resistance or insensitivity of the kidneys to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). As such, treatment involves bypassing ADH altogether and using desmopressin, which acts directly on the renal collecting ducts to increase water reabsorption.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of excessive thirst and urination over the past few months. He reports feeling fatigued and has lost weight despite having a good appetite. His physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes and poor skin turgor consistent with dehydration.

Laboratory investigations reveal hyperglycemia and glycosuria; however, urine osmolality remains low even after fluid restriction.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Central diabetes insipidus
B. Diabetes mellitus type 1
C. Diabetes mellitus type 2
D. Gestational diabetes 
E. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the kidneys are unable to respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urine output and dehydration. This condition can be caused by genetic mutations or acquired conditions such as chronic kidney disease or medications like lithium.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with a history of polyuria and polydipsia for the past few weeks. She has no significant medical history but reports taking an over-the-counter medication for her recent headache. Her physical examination is unremarkable, and laboratory investigations reveal low serum sodium levels and high urine output.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Central diabetes insipidus
B. Drug-induced diuresis 
C. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
D. Primary polydipsia 
E. Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Certain medications, including diuretics, can cause increased urine output and dehydration similar to that seen in diabetes insipidus. These drugs work by inhibiting water reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to increased urine production despite normal levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH).

Question
A 45-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the clinic for her routine follow-up appointment. She reports that she has been experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia despite adhering to her medication regimen and dietary restrictions. On further questioning, she reveals that she has recently started taking herbal supplements for weight loss which were recommended by a friend. Which of the following herbal supplements is most likely responsible for causing her hypoglycemic episodes? 

A. Ginkgo biloba
B. Echinacea 
C. St John’s wort 
D. Ginseng 
E. Saw palmetto

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Ginseng is known to lower blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes who are already on medications that lower blood sugar levels.

Question
A 32-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He had missed his insulin injections for the past week due to financial constraints and was unable to afford his medication until now. His laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, ketones in urine, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte imbalances.
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management step? 

A. Administer intravenous fluids containing dextrose
B. Start an insulin infusion at a high dose
C. Correct electrolyte abnormalities
D. Initiate bicarbonate therapy
E. Perform urgent dialysis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The initial management of DKA involves fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline or Ringer's lactate solution containing dextrose to prevent hypoglycemia and dehydration.

Question
A 50-year-old woman with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus presents to the clinic for evaluation of new-onset hypertension and dyslipidemia. Her fasting blood glucose levels are within the normal range, but her HbA1c levels are elevated. She reports that she has been experiencing frequent episodes of blurred vision and tingling sensations in her hands and feet. On examination, there is evidence of retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
B. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)
C. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)
D. Diabetic nephropathy 
E. Diabetic ketoacidosis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: LADA is a form of type 1 diabetes mellitus that presents in adulthood with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, including insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and autoantibodies against pancreatic islet cells. It can be difficult to differentiate from type 2 diabetes mellitus initially as it may present with mild hyperglycemia or even normoglycemia before progressing to insulin dependence over time.

Question
A 50-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to the ophthalmology clinic complaining of blurred vision and difficulty reading. On examination, her visual acuity is found to be reduced in both eyes. Fundoscopy reveals multiple microaneurysms, dot and blot haemorrhages, and cotton wool spots scattered throughout the retina. Fluorescein angiography confirms the presence of macular oedema. What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents 
B. Panretinal photocoagulation 
C. Vitrectomy 
D. Observation with regular follow-up 
E. Laser treatment for macular oedema

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient has features consistent with diabetic retinopathy, including microaneurysms, dot and blot haemorrhages, cotton wool spots and macular oedema on fluorescein angiography. The most appropriate initial management for this patient would be laser treatment for macular oedema.

Question
A 60-year-old man with a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to his optometrist complaining of poor vision in his left eye over the past few months. Visual acuity measured using a Snellen chart is reduced to 6/24 in the left eye and 6/9 in the right eye. Fundoscopy reveals neovascularisation at the optic disc along with extensive areas of capillary non-perfusion in all four quadrants of the retina in the left eye only; there are no signs of diabetic retinopathy or other ocular pathology in the right eye.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Branch retinal vein occlusion
B. Central serous chorioretinopathy
C. Diabetic papillopathy
D. Ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion
E. Neovascular glaucoma

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient has neovascularisation at the optic disc and extensive areas of capillary non-perfusion in all four quadrants of the retina, which are consistent with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, this is only present in the left eye and there are no signs of diabetic retinopathy or other ocular pathology in the right eye. This suggests that the neovascularisation may be causing secondary complications such as neovascular glaucoma.

Question
A 70-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to her GP complaining of sudden onset loss of vision in her right eye over the past few hours. On examination, visual acuity is reduced to counting fingers at one metre in the affected eye; fundoscopy reveals multiple dot haemorrhages throughout the retina along with macular oedema.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Central serous chorioretinopathy 
B. Diabetic maculopathy 
C. Hypertensive retinopathy 
D. Retinal artery occlusion 
E. Vitreous haemorrhage 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient has features consistent with diabetic maculopathy, including dot haemorrhages throughout the retina and macular oedema causing sudden onset loss of vision in one eye. Other causes such as hypertensive retinopathy or vitreous haemorrhage would typically cause more gradual onset symptoms, while central serous chorioretinopathy or retinal artery occlusion would present differently on examination.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes presents to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past 24 hours. On examination, he is found to be tachycardic, hypotensive, and confused. Laboratory investigations reveal hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis with high anion gap, and ketonuria. The patient is diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and started on intravenous fluids and insulin therapy.

Which of the following factors can contribute to the development of DKA? 

A. Hypothyroidism 
B. Hyperthyroidism 
C. Cushing's syndrome 
D. Pheochromocytoma 
E. Acute pancreatitis

C. Tetralogy of Fallot 
D. Transposition of great arteries 
E. Coarctation of aorta 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common type of congenital heart disease seen in children with Down's syndrome, accounting for approximately half of all cases.

Question
A pregnant woman undergoes chorionic villus sampling at week-11 gestation due to advanced maternal age and family history of chromosomal abnormalities.The results show mosaicism for Trisomy-21 cells only in some placental cells but not present in fetal cells.What does this result indicate? 

A. Maternal contamination during CVS procedure.
B. False-negative result for fetal cells.
C. Mosaicism in the fetus.
D. Partial trisomy 21
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Mosaicism for Trisomy-21 cells only in some placental cells but not present in fetal cells indicates that there is mosaicism in the fetus. This means that some of the baby's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 21, while others do not. The severity and extent of Down's syndrome depends on the proportion and distribution of affected cells.

Question
A 25-year-old woman is brought to the Emergency Department (ED) after being found unconscious in her apartment by her roommate. The patient has a history of opioid addiction and had recently completed detoxification therapy. She admits to injecting heroin prior to losing consciousness but does not know how much she injected or whether it was mixed with any other substances.

On examination, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 3/15, blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, heart rate is 120/min, and respiratory rate is 6/min. Pupils are pinpoint and non-reactive to light. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals severe respiratory acidosis.

Which one of the following medications should be administered first? 

A. Naloxone
B. Flumazenil
C. Sodium bicarbonate 
D. Calcium gluconate 
E. Glucagon

Question
A 30-year-old man presents to the ED after ingesting an unknown quantity of paracetamol tablets approximately six hours ago in a suicide attempt. He reports feeling nauseous and having abdominal pain since then but denies vomiting or passing stool.
His past medical history includes alcohol abuse disorder and chronic hepatitis B infection treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).

What would be the most appropriate management plan? 

A. Administer activated charcoal 
B. Perform gastric lavage 
C. Measure serum paracetamol levels 
D. Start acetylcysteine infusion 
E. Initiate liver transplant evaluation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In this scenario, the patient presents with a possible paracetamol overdose. Serum paracetamol levels should be measured at least four hours after ingestion to determine whether the patient is at risk for hepatotoxicity and requires acetylcysteine therapy. Activated charcoal or gastric lavage are not recommended in patients who present more than one hour after ingestion. Liver transplant evaluation is premature at this stage.

Question
A 40-year-old man is brought into the ED by ambulance following an intentional overdose of multiple medications including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and antipsychotics. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and had stopped taking his medication two weeks ago due to side effects.

On examination, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 6/15, blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, heart rate is 130/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. Pupils are dilated but reactive to light. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia with prolonged QT interval.

What would be the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Administer activated charcoal 
B. Perform gastric lavage 
C. Initiate intravenous fluids 
D. Start sodium bicarbonate infusion 
E. Begin haemodialysis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In this scenario, the patient presents with symptoms consistent with toxicity from multiple drugs including tricyclic antidepressants which can cause QRS prolongation and arrhythmias that may lead to cardiac arrest if left untreated. Sodium bicarbonate infusion should be initiated immediately as it can correct acidosis and prevent further QRS widening while awaiting specific antidotes such as physostigmine or lipid emulsion therapy depending on the causative agent(s). Activated charcoal or gastric lavage are not recommended in patients who present more than one hour after ingestion. Intravenous fluids and haemodialysis may be required depending on the patient's clinical status.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Binge-eating disorder
B. Anorexia nervosa
C. Bulimia nervosa
D. ARFID
E. Night eating syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with binge-eating disorder, which involves recurrent episodes of binge eating without compensatory behaviours.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She reports a positive pregnancy test but has no history of infertility or previous ectopic pregnancies. On examination, her blood pressure is low and she appears pale. An ultrasound scan reveals an ectopic pregnancy in the right fallopian tube that has ruptured, causing significant internal bleeding.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?

A. Expectant management
B. Methotrexate
C. Misoprostol
D. Emergency laparotomy with salpingectomy
E. Urgent laparoscopic salpingostomy

Correct Answer: D

Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most useful to confirm this diagnosis? 

A. Transvaginal ultrasound
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pelvis
C. Computed tomography (CT) scan abdomen and pelvis
D. Hysterosalpingogram
E. Laparoscopy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: While laparoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis, MRI pelvis can provide valuable information regarding the location, extent and depth of infiltration of DIE lesions which can aid in surgical planning.

Question
A 25-year-old nulliparous woman presents with severe dysmenorrhoea that has been unresponsive to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). She also reports cyclical bowel symptoms including diarrhoea during her periods. On examination, there is no palpable adnexal mass but there is tenderness on bimanual examination and rectovaginal examination reveals nodularity along the posterior vaginal wall extending onto the rectum consistent with rectovaginal endometriosis.
Which one of the following treatment options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues 
B. Combined oral contraceptive pill 
C. Medroxyprogesterone acetate 
D. Danazol 
E. Intrauterine system (Mirena)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) are a first-line treatment option for endometriosis-associated pain. They work by suppressing ovarian function and inducing a hypoestrogenic state which can lead to symptom relief in up to 80% of patients. However, they are associated with significant side effects such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness and decreased bone density.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with chronic pelvic pain that has been ongoing for several years. She reports dysmenorrhoea and deep dyspareunia but denies any bowel or bladder symptoms. On examination, there is no palpable adnexal mass but there is tenderness on bimanual examination.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a fall from a height of 20 feet. He was not wearing any protective gear at the time of the accident and lost consciousness immediately following the fall. Upon arrival, he is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to decreased level of consciousness. On examination, there is no focal neurological deficit, but his pupils are unequal with the left pupil being dilated and unreactive to light. A CT scan reveals an extradural haemorrhage in the right parietal region.
Which one of the following is true regarding this patient? 

A. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score will be less than or equal to 8.
B. The patient may have associated subarachnoid haemorrhage.
C. The presence of a skull fracture increases the likelihood of an extradural haemorrhage.
D. Surgical intervention should be delayed until neurological deterioration occurs.
E. Anticoagulation therapy can be initiated without concern for worsening bleeding.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Extradural haemorrhages typically occur as a result of trauma causing rupture of meningeal arteries that traverse through bony grooves on the inner surface of the skull, leading to accumulation of blood between dura mater and skull bone. Presence of a skull fracture increases risk for extradural haematoma by damaging these meningeal vessels.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with headache, vomiting, and confusion following a minor head injury sustained while playing football earlier that day. He has no significant past medical history and takes no medications regularly except for occasional over-the-counter pain relief medication for headaches which he describes as "migraine-like." On examination, he is alert but disoriented with mild neck stiffness; there are no focal neurological deficits noted on cranial nerve or motor/sensory testing; and his pupils are equal and reactive to light. A CT scan of the head reveals an extradural haemorrhage in the left temporal region.
Which one of the following is true regarding this patient? 

A. The patient's headache is likely due to a tension-type headache rather than related to the extradural haemorrhage.
B. The presence of a midline shift on imaging indicates that surgical intervention is necessary.
C. Patients with underlying coagulopathy are at decreased risk for developing an extradural haematoma.
D. Treatment options include observation, surgical evacuation, or embolization depending on size and location of the haematoma.
E. Prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy should be initiated immediately.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Treatment options for patients with extradural haematomas depend on their size, location, and neurological status. Small asymptomatic hematomas may be observed while larger ones causing mass effect require prompt surgical evacuation or embolization if surgery is not feasible.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with sudden onset right-sided weakness and slurred speech; he reports no history of trauma or recent falls but has been experiencing headaches over the past few weeks which he attributed to stress at work. On examination, there is significant right-sided hemiparesis affecting both upper and lower limbs along with dysarthria; cranial nerve testing reveals a left gaze preference without nystagmus; and his pupils are equal and reactive to light. A CT scan shows an extensive extradural haemorrhage involving multiple regions bilaterally including frontal, parietal, occipital lobes as well as cerebellum.
Which one of the following statements about this condition is true? 

A. Extradural haemorrhages typically occur in younger individuals who have sustained high-velocity injuries such as motor vehicle accidents or sports-related trauma.
B. The presence of bilateral extradural haemorrhages is highly suggestive of underlying coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis.
C. Patients with extensive extradural haemorrhages are unlikely to recover neurological function even with prompt surgical intervention.
D. Treatment options for this patient include anticoagulation therapy and observation as the risk of surgery outweighs potential benefits.
E. This condition is often associated with a lucid interval followed by rapid deterioration in neurological status.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Extradural haematomas can cause a brief period of consciousness following trauma due to compression of brainstem reticular activating system leading to transient loss of consciousness, which may be followed by a lucid interval before onset of progressive symptoms such as headache, vomiting, confusion, seizures or focal neurological deficits. Bilateral extradural hematomas are rare and suggest an underlying bleeding disorder; prompt surgical evacuation is necessary in most cases to prevent further neurological damage.

Question
A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department following a seizure with fever. The parents report that he has had several episodes of febrile convulsions in the past, and they are concerned about his future risk for epilepsy.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: EUS is a sensitive imaging modality that can detect small gallstones and identify other causes of biliary symptoms such as choledocholithiasis or pancreatic cancer. It is recommended in patients with recurrent biliary colic who have normal ultrasound findings.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of severe upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He has a history of alcohol abuse and chronic pancreatitis but denies any recent alcohol intake. On examination, he appears uncomfortable and tachycardic with tenderness in his epigastrium and right upper quadrant. Blood tests reveal elevated amylase levels but normal liver function tests.
Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation? 

A. Acute cholecystitis
B. Biliary colic 
C. Pancreatic pseudocyst rupture 
D. Choledocholithiasis 
E. Acute hepatitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Chronic pancreatitis can lead to the formation of pancreatic pseudocysts which may become infected or rupture causing acute abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis. This requires urgent management including antibiotics, drainage procedures, or surgical intervention depending on the severity of the presentation.

Question
A 65-year-old male with a history of peripheral artery disease and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his right foot. On examination, you observe that his toes are blackened and have no sensation. The patient is diagnosed with dry gangrene.

Which of the following is NOT a common cause of dry gangrene? 

A. Atherosclerosis
B. Buerger's disease
C. Raynaud's phenomenon
D. Diabetes mellitus 
E. Thromboangiitis obliterans

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Dry gangrene occurs due to gradual slowing of blood flow leading to tissue desiccation, typically caused by atherosclerosis, thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), or diabetes mellitus. Raynaud's phenomenon causes vasospasm and can lead to ischemia but does not commonly result in dry gangrene.

Question

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with a history of epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting for the past 3 months. She has lost about 8 kg in weight during this time. On examination, she appears pale and dehydrated. Blood tests reveal iron deficiency anaemia and elevated tumour markers. CT scan shows thickening of the gastric wall with enlarged lymph nodes.
Which of the following is not a common histological subtype of gastric cancer? 

A. Diffuse type
B. Intestinal type
C. Mixed type
D. Signet ring cell carcinoma 
E. Mucinous adenocarcinoma

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Gastric cancer can be classified into two main types based on its macroscopic appearance - intestinal type and diffuse type (also known as linitis plastica). The intestinal type is more common and arises from glandular cells lining the stomach mucosa, while the diffuse type arises from scattered cells throughout the stomach wall without forming distinct glands or masses. Other less common subtypes include mixed-type and signet-ring cell carcinoma.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of dyspepsia, early satiety, and occasional vomiting over the past few weeks. He has no significant past medical history but reports smoking heavily for many years before quitting five years ago. Endoscopy reveals an ulcerative mass in the distal part of his stomach that extends into the pylorus.
What is the most appropriate initial management option? 

A. Surgical resection 
B. Palliative chemotherapy 
C. Endoscopic mucosal resection 
D. Endoscopic submucosal dissection 
E. Radiotherapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive technique used for treating early-stage gastric cancer that has not spread beyond the mucosal layer. It involves removing the tumour and a surrounding margin of healthy tissue using an endoscope with specialised instruments. ESD is associated with lower morbidity and mortality rates than surgical resection, making it a preferred option for patients who are unfit or unwilling to undergo surgery.

Question
A 72-year-old man presents with abdominal pain, vomiting, and weight loss over the past few months. He has a history of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for many years. CT scan shows thickening of the gastric wall with enlarged lymph nodes in the perigastric region.
Which of the following is not a recognised risk factor for gastric cancer? 

A. Helicobacter pylori infection
B. Epstein-Barr virus infection
C. Family history of gastric cancer 
D. Prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
E. Blood group O

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Chronic inflammation caused by Helicobacter pylori infection is a well-established risk factor for developing gastric cancer, particularly intestinal-type adenocarcinoma. Other factors that increase the risk include Epstein-Barr virus infection, family history of gastric cancer, blood group A or B, smoking, alcohol consumption, and low socioeconomic status. However, prolonged use of NSAIDs has been shown to have a protective effect against gastric cancer due to their anti-inflammatory properties.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and distension. He has a history of chronic constipation and has been taking laxatives regularly for the past year. On examination, his abdomen is tense, tender, and tympanic on percussion with absent bowel sounds. His vital signs are stable. CT scan shows perforation of the sigmoid colon with fecal peritonitis.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management?

A. Intravenous antibiotics
B. Bowel rest and nasogastric tube insertion
C. Emergency laparotomy
D. Endoscopic stenting
E. Colonic decompression

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests an acute surgical emergency requiring urgent intervention to prevent sepsis and multi-organ failure. The best initial management would be an emergency laparotomy to identify and repair the site of perforation, perform peritoneal lavage, and drain any abscesses or collections.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a one-day history of sudden onset severe epigastric pain radiating to her back associated with nausea and vomiting. She has a past medical history significant for alcohol abuse and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis over the last two years.

On examination, she appears uncomfortable but is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Her abdomen is soft but tender in the epigastrium without guarding or rebound tenderness.

Laboratory investigations reveal elevated serum amylase levels (500 U/L) and leukocytosis (15 x 10^9/L).

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms? 

A. Acute cholecystitis 
B. Acute gastritis 
C. Acute pancreatitis 
D. Gastrointestinal perforation 
E. Mesenteric ischemia

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Iron-deficiency anemia
B. Thalassemia minor 
C. Sideroblastic anemia 
D. Hereditary hemochromatosis 
E. Anemia of chronic disease

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical picture suggests sideroblastic anemia, which is a group of disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis leading to microcytic hypochromic anemia with increased iron stores in bone marrow macrophages and peripheral tissues such as liver, spleen, and heart. It can be inherited or acquired due to various causes including genetic mutations, alcoholism, lead poisoning, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), infections, drugs/toxins exposure, and vitamin B6 deficiency. Inherited forms are usually X-linked or autosomal recessive; they present early in life with developmental delay, failure to thrive, skeletal abnormalities, and recurrent infections.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with fatigue and joint pain for several months along with abdominal discomfort and dark urine for two weeks. He has a history of heavy alcohol consumption for many years but stopped drinking six months ago after being diagnosed with cirrhosis.
On examination he appears jaundiced; there are no other abnormal physical findings noted.
Blood tests show elevated bilirubin level (4 mg/dL), high ferritin levels (>1000 µg/L), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST >500 IU/L), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).
Abdominal ultrasound shows hepatomegaly with nodular surface consistent with cirrhosis.
Which one of the following is not associated with this condition? 

A. Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
B. Increased risk of diabetes mellitus 
C. Increased risk of bacterial infections 
D. Increased risk of osteoporosis 
E. Decreased risk of iron overload

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical picture suggests alcoholic liver disease, which is a spectrum of disorders ranging from fatty liver to cirrhosis caused by chronic alcohol consumption leading to hepatic steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis and eventually nodular regeneration with loss of function. Clinical features include fatigue, jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy, bleeding tendency due to coagulopathy or portal hypertension, and increased susceptibility to infections especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Laboratory findings include elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), high bilirubin levels (>2 mg/dL), prolonged PT/aPTT indicating impaired synthetic function, and elevated ferritin levels reflecting the inflammatory state. Complications include hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), diabetes mellitus (DM), osteoporosis due to vitamin D deficiency and decreased estrogen production in women. Iron overload is not associated with this condition unless there is concomitant hereditary hemochromatosis or other causes of secondary iron overload such as transfusion-dependent anemias or chronic hepatitis C infection.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain, joint pain and swelling, fatigue and shortness of breath for the last few years. She has been diagnosed with sickle cell disease since childhood. On examination, she is pale and icteric.

Explanation: Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in HSP raise concern for intussusception, which occurs due to bowel wall inflammation leading to telescoping of one segment into another. Abdominal ultrasound is a reliable diagnostic tool for intussusception, and prompt surgical intervention is necessary to prevent bowel necrosis or perforation.

Question
A 12-year-old boy presents with a history of persistent joint pains and skin rashes over his lower limbs for the last 6 months. He was previously diagnosed with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) but did not receive any specific treatment as he had no significant complications at presentation. On examination, there are palpable purpura over his buttocks and legs, mild ankle oedema, and tenderness on deep palpation of both knee joints.
Which investigation would be most useful in assessing disease activity? Which laboratory parameter would indicate active disease? What is the recommended management strategy? 

A. Renal biopsy; serum creatinine; immunosuppressive therapy
B. Urinalysis; proteinuria; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
C. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate; C-reactive protein; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
D. Complement levels; low C3 and C4 levels; corticosteroids 
E. Skin biopsy; IgA deposition in the dermal vessels; plasma exchange therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In HSP, complement activation leads to immune complex deposition in small blood vessels, causing inflammation and damage to affected organs such as skin, joints, and kidneys. Measurement of complement levels (C3 and C4) can indicate disease activity, with low levels suggesting ongoing inflammation. Treatment for active disease involves corticosteroids to suppress the immune response and prevent further tissue damage.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset of fever, abdominal pain and jaundice. She has a history of intravenous drug use and unprotected sexual contact with multiple partners. On examination, she is febrile and tender in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and positive serology for hepatitis B, C and D viruses. An ultrasound scan shows evidence of cirrhosis with ascites and splenomegaly.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acute hepatitis A infection
B. Acute hepatitis B infection
C. Acute hepatitis C infection
D. Chronic hepatitis B infection
E. Hepatocellular carcinoma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history suggests high-risk behaviour for viral infections including intravenous drug use and unprotected sex with multiple partners which puts her at risk for contracting blood-borne viruses such as HBV, HCV, HDV or HIV. Positive serology for HBV, HCV and HDV indicates chronic viral infections that can lead to complications such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or fulminant hepatic failure.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of fatigue, anorexia and weight loss over several months duration. He denies any alcohol consumption but admits to having received blood transfusions during surgery 20 years ago due to a perforated peptic ulcer disease.
On examination he appears pale with mild icterus noted on sclerae but no other significant findings are elicited.
Blood tests show deranged liver function tests (LFTs) with raised bilirubin levels predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.
Further investigations reveal positive serology for anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies while all other viral markers were negative.
Which of the following statements regarding this patient's hepatitis E virus infection is true?

A. Hepatitis E virus infection is typically associated with chronic liver disease
B. Hepatitis E virus infection can be transmitted through sexual contact
C. Hepatitis E virus infection has a high mortality rate in pregnant women
D. Hepatitis E virus infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within 4-6 weeks
E. There are currently no effective treatments for hepatitis E virus infection

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: HEV is a non-enveloped RNA virus that causes acute viral hepatitis similar to HAV but with higher morbidity and mortality rates especially in pregnant women or those with underlying liver disease such as cirrhosis. The mode of transmission is primarily faecal-oral via contaminated water sources, food or direct contact with infected individuals.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting over the past few months.
She denies any significant medical history except for being diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis several years ago which she manages on thyroxine replacement therapy.
On examination, she appears pale and jaundiced with mild hepatomegaly noted on palpation.
Blood tests show elevated LFTs predominantly raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels while other markers were normal.
Further investigations reveal positive serology for anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA).
Which of the following statements regarding this patient's diagnosis is correct?

A. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is more common in males than females
B. PBC is commonly associated with alcohol consumption or drug abuse
C. AMA positivity confirms the diagnosis of PBC without further testing required
D. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first-line treatment for PBC
E. Liver transplantation should be considered early in patients with advanced stage PBC

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: PBC is a chronic autoimmune liver disease that primarily affects middle-aged women and is characterised by progressive destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts leading to cholestasis, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. AMA positivity is highly specific for PBC but not sensitive as up to 10% of patients with PBC may be AMA negative. UDCA is the only approved therapy for PBC which has been shown to improve LFTs, delay progression of fibrosis and reduce the risk of complications such as portal hypertension or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with a lump in the right groin that he has noticed for several months. He reports occasional discomfort but no pain or bowel symptoms. On examination, there is a reducible swelling in the right inguinal region that increases in size on coughing.
Which of the following statements regarding inguinal hernias is correct? 
A. Indirect inguinal hernias are more common than direct inguinal hernias
B. Femoral hernias are always located medial to the pubic tubercle
C. The Hesselbach triangle contains the femoral canal and inferior epigastric vessels
D. An incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia can lead to testicular ischemia
E. Mesh repair is contraindicated in patients with recurrent inguinal hernias

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Inguinal hernias are classified as either indirect or direct depending on their relationship to the inferior epigastric vessels. Indirect inguinal hernias emerge lateral to the pubic tubercle through the deep inguinal ring and pass through the internal (deep) inguinal ring into the scrotum, whereas direct inguinal hernias protrude medially through a weakness in the transversalis fascia at Hesselbach’s triangle, which lies medial to the inferior epigastric vessels and lateral to rectus abdominis muscle insertion. Femoral hernias occur below and lateral to pubic tubercle when abdominal contents enter through femoral canal beneath it.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with an irreducible left-sided groin swelling associated with nausea, vomiting, and constipation for two days duration.
On examination, she appears unwell with tachycardia and hypotension; her abdomen is distended with diffuse tenderness without guarding or rigidity. A tender irreducible swelling is palpable in the left groin below and lateral to the pubic tubercle.
Which of the following statements regarding hernias is correct? 
A. Femoral hernias are more common in men than women
B. Incarcerated inguinal hernias can cause bowel obstruction or strangulation
C. Obturator hernias present with a lump in the medial thigh
D. Richter’s hernia involves only part of the circumference of bowel wall, leading to partial obstruction
E. Spigelian hernias occur through defects in linea alba

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: An incarcerated inguinal hernia occurs when abdominal contents become trapped within an indirect or direct inguinal canal, causing pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and urinary retention. If not reduced promptly, it may lead to bowel obstruction or strangulation due to impaired blood supply to entrapped tissues.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with a painful right-sided scrotal swelling that has developed over several hours and is associated with nausea and vomiting.
On examination, he appears unwell with tachycardia; his abdomen is distended with diffuse tenderness without guarding or rigidity. There is a tender irreducible swelling in the right groin located above and medial to the pubic tubercle.
What type of hernia does this patient most likely have? 
A. Direct inguinal hernia
B. Indirect inguinal hernia
C. Femoral hernia
D. Umbilical hernia
E. Epigastric hernia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The location of the swelling above and medial to pubic tubercle suggests femoral rather than inguinal origin as femoral canal lies beneath pectineus muscle which attaches medially at pubic bone while inguinal canal lies above it. Femoral hernias are more common in women and present with a painful, tender swelling in the groin that may become irreducible or strangulated due to the narrow femoral ring which makes them prone to incarceration.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents with a painful rash on his genital area. He reports having unprotected sex with multiple partners in the past few weeks. On examination, there are multiple vesicles and ulcers on the penis and scrotum. The patient is diagnosed with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.

Which of the following statements regarding HSV-2 infection is true? 

A. Most individuals infected with HSV-2 are asymptomatic.
B. Primary HSV-2 infection typically causes only mild symptoms.
C. Recurrent episodes of genital herpes are usually shorter in duration than primary infections.
D. Antiviral therapy does not reduce the risk of transmission to sexual partners.
E. Serological testing for HSV-2 antibodies is recommended for all sexually active individuals.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Recurrent episodes of genital herpes are usually shorter in duration than primary infections, lasting an average of 5 days compared to 10–14 days for primary infections. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because most individuals infected with HSV-2 have symptomatic disease; primary HSV-2 infection can cause severe symptoms; antiviral therapy reduces the frequency and severity of recurrent episodes as well as the risk of transmission to sexual partners; serological testing for HSV-2 antibodies is not routinely recommended for all sexually active individuals.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent oral ulcers that she has been experiencing since childhood. She reports having at least one episode per month, which lasts for about a week each time. She also complains of fatigue and joint pain during these episodes but denies any other significant medical history or family history.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Herpes labialis
B. Aphthous stomatitis
C. Behcet's syndrome
D. Stevens-Johnson syndrome
E. Pemphigus vulgaris

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Behcet's syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, as well as ocular, skin, and joint manifestations. The disease typically affects young adults and has a higher prevalence in certain ethnic groups such as Middle Easterners and Asians. Options A and B are incorrect because herpes labialis (cold sores) usually occurs on the lips or around the mouth, while aphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is a common benign condition that typically resolves within 1-2 weeks without scarring; options D and E are incorrect because Stevens-Johnson syndrome and pemphigus vulgaris are severe autoimmune disorders that cause mucocutaneous blistering but have different clinical features.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, and confusion for the past two days. He reports having unprotected sex with multiple partners in the past few weeks. On examination, there are no focal neurological deficits or rash noted. Lumbar puncture reveals an elevated white blood cell count with lymphocytic predominance and elevated protein levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis
B. Viral meningitis due to enterovirus
C. Meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae
D. Herpes simplex virus encephalitis
E. Tuberculous meningitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is a serious viral infection of the central nervous system that can present with symptoms similar to bacterial meningitis such as fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, altered mental status or seizures. It commonly affects immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying neurologic conditions but can also occur in healthy individuals following primary HSV infection. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they represent common causes of bacterial or viral meningitis but do not typically cause encephalitis; option E is incorrect because tuberculous meningitis usually presents with subacute symptoms over weeks to months and has a different cerebrospinal fluid profile.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the gastroenterology clinic with a history of frequent heartburn and regurgitation for the past year. He has tried over-the-counter antacids without relief.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent kidney stones and fatigue. She has been experiencing bone pain for the past few months, which is affecting her daily routine. Her blood tests reveal hypercalcaemia and elevated PTH levels. Imaging studies show a parathyroid adenoma. What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient? 

A. Observation 
B. Medical therapy 
C. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy
D. Open surgical exploration 
E. Radiofrequency ablation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a solitary parathyroid adenoma, as seen in this case scenario. Management options include observation, medical therapy or surgery depending on the severity of symptoms, serum calcium level, age and comorbidities of the patient. In symptomatic patients with evidence of end-organ damage or significantly elevated serum calcium levels (>1 mg/dL above upper limit of normal), surgery is recommended to remove the affected gland(s). Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) is preferred over open surgical exploration due to its lower morbidity rate.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with severe constipation and abdominal discomfort for several weeks along with polyuria and nocturia at night time that has been progressively worsening over the last year despite treatment with antihypertensive medications including diuretics.
His laboratory investigations showed an elevated serum calcium level and high PTH levels consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Renal failure
B. Hyperthyroidism
C. Multiple myeloma
D. Primary hyperparathyroidism
E. Vitamin D toxicity

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's clinical presentation along with his laboratory findings are suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism caused by a parathyroid adenoma. Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcaemia in ambulatory patients and should be considered in any patient with unexplained hypercalcaemia.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of muscle weakness, fatigue and confusion for several days. She has a history of chronic kidney disease stage 3 and hypertension for which she takes multiple medications including calcium supplements.
Her laboratory investigations reveal severe hypercalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, elevated PTH levels and low vitamin D levels.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
B. Secondary hyperparathyroidism
C. Hypoparathyroidism 
D. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)
E. Vitamin D deficiency

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's clinical presentation along with her laboratory findings are suggestive of secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by chronic renal failure leading to decreased activation of vitamin D and subsequent hypocalcemia resulting in increased secretion of PTH from the parathyroid glands causing bone resorption and release of calcium into circulation leading to hypercalcemia.

She has been on multiple medications including mesalazine, azathioprine, and infliximab but her symptoms have not improved. Her current symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. On examination, she appears malnourished with a BMI of 16 kg/m². Blood tests reveal low albumin levels and elevated CRP levels. An MRI enterography is performed which shows extensive inflammation involving the terminal ileum and cecum with multiple strictures.
What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient? 

A. Continue medical therapy with high-dose steroids
B. Initiate treatment with vedolizumab
C. Consider surgical resection of affected bowel segments 
D. Add methotrexate to current medication regimen
E. Start treatment with ustekinumab

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests that she has developed complications related to IBD such as stricturing or penetrating disease which are refractory to medical therapy alone. In such cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove affected bowel segments and improve quality of life.

Question
A 24-year-old male presents with bloody diarrhea associated with crampy abdominal pain for the past week along with fever and chills over the last two days. He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis three years ago and has been maintained on mesalazine since then without any flare-ups until now.
On examination, he appears dehydrated and his abdomen is tender on palpation in the left lower quadrant.
Which of the following investigations would be most useful in diagnosing an infectious cause? 

A. Stool culture for Campylobacter jejuni 
B. Serology testing for cytomegalovirus (CMV)
C. Stool culture for Salmonella species
D. PCR testing for Clostridium difficile toxin 
E. Serology testing for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and history suggest an infectious cause, with C.difficile being a common culprit in patients with IBD who have been on antibiotics or immunosuppressive therapy. PCR testing is the most sensitive method to detect C.difficile toxins in stool samples.

Question
A 38-year-old female presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss over the past six months. She has no significant medical history but her mother was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at a young age.
On examination, she appears pale and malnourished with a BMI of 17 kg/m². Blood tests reveal low hemoglobin levels and elevated CRP levels.
A colonoscopy is performed which shows patchy inflammation involving the terminal ileum and cecum with skip lesions.
What is the most appropriate management plan? 

A. Initiate treatment with mesalazine
B. Start treatment with adalimumab
C. Consider surgical resection of affected bowel segments 
D. Add methotrexate to current medication regimen
E. Start treatment with ustekinumab

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests that she has developed Crohn's disease which involves the small intestine as well as other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the colon in a discontinuous pattern (skip lesions). Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that can be used to induce remission in moderate to severe cases of Crohn's disease involving both small and large intestines.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a high-grade fever, cough, and body aches for the past 3 days. She has no significant medical history but reports that her husband was diagnosed with influenza last week. On examination, she is febrile with a temperature of 39.5 degrees Celsius and tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Her chest X-ray shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonia. The rapid influenza test confirms the diagnosis of influenza A.

Which one of the following antiviral medications should be initiated? 

A. Zanamivir
B. Rimantadine
C. Ribavirin
D. Baloxavir marboxil
E. Peramivir

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Baloxavir marboxil is an oral antiviral medication approved by the FDA for treating acute uncomplicated influenza in patients aged 12 years or older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours and are at high risk for developing complications from influenza.

Question
An elderly patient presents to your clinic during flu season complaining of symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue that started abruptly two days ago. You suspect he may have contracted influenza based on his clinical presentation and recent outbreak in his community.

What diagnostic tests would you order? 

A. Rapid antigen detection test (RADT) only
B. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) only
C. Both RADT and RT-PCR 
D. Chest X-ray 
E. Complete blood count (CBC)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: While both RADT and RT-PCR can diagnose influenza infection, RT-PCR is considered more sensitive and specific than RADT due to its ability to detect viral RNA. However, RADT is quicker and less expensive than RT-PCR. Therefore, both tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of influenza.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents with a fever, cough, and sore throat for the past two days. She has no significant medical history but reports that her roommate was diagnosed with influenza last week. On examination, she is febrile with a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius and tachycardic with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Her chest X-ray shows no abnormalities.

Which one of the following medications would you prescribe? 

A. Amantadine
B. Acetaminophen
C. Oseltamivir 
D. Ibuprofen 
E. Azithromycin

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Oseltamivir is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA for treating uncomplicated influenza in patients aged 14 days or older who have been symptomatic for no more than two days and are at high risk for developing complications from influenza. It works by inhibiting neuraminidase activity on viral particles, thus preventing their release from infected cells and reducing viral replication and spread within the respiratory tract.

Question
A 75-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and atrial fibrillation for which he takes warfarin. On examination, his abdomen is distended and tender on palpation. Blood tests reveal an elevated white cell count and lactate level.

Which of the following conditions is associated with an increased risk of mesenteric venous thrombosis? 

A. Factor V Leiden mutation
B. Antithrombin III deficiency
C. Protein C deficiency 
D. Protein S deficiency 
E. Lupus anticoagulant syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) occurs due to obstruction of the mesenteric veins leading to intestinal ischaemia and infarction. It can be caused by a number of factors including hypercoagulable states such as factor V Leiden mutation, antithrombin III deficiency, protein C or S deficiencies, lupus anticoagulant syndrome, malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease among others.

Question
A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vomiting for the past two days. She has a history of Crohn's disease and multiple previous surgeries, including an ileocecal resection. On examination, her abdomen is distended with diffuse tenderness and high-pitched bowel sounds. CT scan shows dilated small bowel loops with air-fluid levels consistent with small bowel obstruction. The patient undergoes exploratory laparotomy which reveals dense adhesions causing kinking and twisting of the small bowel.

Which one of the following statements regarding adhesive small bowel obstruction is true? 

A. Adhesive small bowel obstruction accounts for approximately 60% of all mechanical intestinal obstructions.
B. Patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction typically present with colicky abdominal pain that resolves spontaneously within 24 hours.
C. Conservative management with nasogastric decompression and intravenous fluids is sufficient in most cases of adhesive small bowel obstruction.
D. Recurrence rates after surgical intervention for adhesive small bowel obstruction are low, at less than 5%.
E. Laparoscopic surgery is contraindicated in patients with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Adhesive small bowel obstruction is the most common cause of mechanical intestinal obstruction, accounting for approximately 60% of cases. Patients typically present with colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and obstipation (inability to pass stool or gas). Treatment involves supportive measures such as nasogastric decompression and intravenous fluids; however, surgical intervention may be necessary if conservative management fails or if there are signs of strangulation or perforation. Recurrence rates after surgery range from 10-30%. Laparoscopy can be used safely in patients who have undergone previous abdominal surgeries.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of severe lower abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. He has a history of diverticulitis and had an episode of sigmoid colon perforation requiring surgical intervention 10 years ago. On examination, his abdomen is distended with tenderness in the left lower quadrant. CT scan shows evidence of large bowel obstruction at the site of previous surgery.

Which one of the following statements regarding colonic strictures is true? 

A. Colonic strictures are most commonly caused by inflammatory bowel disease.
B. Strictures located in the rectosigmoid region are more likely to be malignant than those located elsewhere in the colon.
C. Endoscopic balloon dilation is contraindicated in patients with colonic strictures due to risk of perforation.
D. Surgery is typically required for symptomatic colonic strictures that do not respond to medical management.
E. The risk of recurrence after surgical resection for colonic strictures is less than 5%.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Colonic strictures can result from a variety of causes including inflammatory bowel disease, radiation therapy, ischemia, and malignancy. Patients may present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, constipation or diarrhea depending on the location and severity of the stricture. Treatment options include endoscopic balloon dilation, stent placement, or surgical resection depending on the cause and extent of the stricture as well as patient factors such as comorbidities and overall health status. Surgery is typically reserved for symptomatic cases that do not respond to medical management or endoscopic interventions.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of abdominal discomfort and bloating over the past few weeks associated with decreased appetite and weight loss. He has a history significant for smoking and alcohol abuse but no prior gastrointestinal surgeries or diagnoses. On examination, there is diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding noted; however, digital rectal exam reveals occult blood in the stool.

Which one of the following statements regarding colonic tumors is true? 

A. The majority of colorectal cancers arise from benign adenomas.
B. Rectal bleeding is a common presenting symptom for right-sided colon tumors.
C. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis and staging of colonic tumors.
D. Surgery alone is curative in most cases of advanced-stage colon cancer.
E. Chemotherapy is typically reserved for patients with early-stage colon cancer who are at high risk for recurrence.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 10% of all new cancer diagnoses annually. Most CRCs arise from adenomatous polyps which can be detected and removed during screening colonoscopies; however, some may present as symptomatic masses or lesions that require surgical intervention. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, change in bowel habits, rectal bleeding or anemia should prompt further evaluation including imaging studies and endoscopic biopsies to establish a definitive diagnosis and stage the disease appropriately. Treatment options depend on tumor size, location, extent and patient factors such as age, comorbidities and overall health status but typically involve surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy depending on the stage of disease at presentation.

Question
A 6-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department by his parents with a history of vomiting and bloody stools for the past 2 days. The infant has been irritable and lethargic, refusing feeds and crying inconsolably. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. An abdominal X-ray shows signs of bowel obstruction, while an ultrasound scan reveals a target sign consistent with intussusception.

What is the most appropriate management option for this patient?

A. Immediate surgical intervention
B. Conservative management with intravenous fluids and antibiotics
C. Barium enema reduction under radiological guidance
D. Air enema reduction under radiological guidance
E. Observation with serial imaging

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In cases where intussusception is suspected, air or barium enema reduction can be performed as a first-line treatment option before considering surgery. Air enema reduction is preferred over barium enema reduction due to its lower risk of complications such as chemical peritonitis.

Question
A 3-year-old child presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that started suddenly after playing outside earlier in the day. The child has been vomiting intermittently since then but has not passed any stool or gas for several hours now. On examination, there are signs of dehydration and tenderness on palpation of the abdomen without any palpable masses.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Intussusception
B. Appendicitis
C. Mesenteric adenitis
D. Gastroenteritis
E. Constipation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Although appendicitis typically presents with pain in the right lower quadrant, it can present atypically with diffuse abdominal pain that may mimic other conditions such as intussusception.

Question
A 5-year-old boy presents to his primary care physician with a history of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and vomiting over the past few months. The child appears well between episodes, but during these episodes, he is inconsolable and draws his legs up to his chest. There is no history of bloody stools or fever.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Intussusception
B. Gastroenteritis
C. Irritable bowel syndrome
D. Celiac disease
E. Functional abdominal pain

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in children without any organic cause are often diagnosed as functional abdominal pain (FAP). FAP can be associated with stress, anxiety, or other psychological factors and typically resolves spontaneously over time without any specific treatment.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a red and painful left eye for the past 3 days. He reports that his vision has been slightly blurry in this eye, but he denies any photophobia or discharge from the eye. On examination, you note ciliary injection and mild anterior chamber reaction in his left eye. His visual acuity is reduced to 6/9 in this eye compared to 6/6 in the right eye. You suspect iritis as the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Which of the following conditions should be considered as a differential diagnosis? 

A. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
B. Corneal abrasion 
C. Orbital cellulitis 
D. Scleritis 
E. Posterior uveitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Scleritis can present similarly to iritis with pain, redness and decreased vision, making it an important differential diagnosis to consider.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with a sudden onset of severe headache, nausea and vomiting along with blurred vision in her right eye for the past few hours. She also complains of seeing halos around lights on her way to the hospital. Her medical history is significant for hypertension which is well-controlled on medication.
On examination, her right pupil is dilated and non-reactive to light while her left pupil reacts normally to light stimulation. Slit-lamp examination reveals corneal edema and shallow anterior chamber depth in her right eye.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Iritis
B. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
C. Optic neuritis
D. Central retinal artery occlusion
E. Cataract

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests acute angle-closure glaucoma which requires prompt treatment to prevent permanent loss of vision.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of recurrent episodes of redness, pain and photophobia in his left eye. He reports that the symptoms usually resolve within a few days but recur frequently. On examination, you note mild ciliary injection and anterior chamber reaction in his left eye. His visual acuity is normal bilaterally.
Which of the following investigations would be most useful to confirm the diagnosis? 

A. Fluorescein angiography
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
C. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)
D. Schirmer's test 
E. HLA-B27 typing

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: AS-OCT can detect subtle changes in the anterior segment structures which may not be visible on slit-lamp examination and can aid in confirming the diagnosis of iritis or ruling out other conditions such as scleritis or uveitis.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents with a history of chronic abdominal pain, bloating, and alternating diarrhoea and constipation for the past year. She has tried several over-the-counter medications without relief. On examination, there are no significant findings except mild tenderness on palpation of the left lower quadrant. Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in this patient? 

A. Colonoscopy
B. Abdominal ultrasound scan
C. Faecal occult blood test
D. Hydrogen breath test
E. Rome IV criteria

He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and smoking. On examination, he is diaphoretic and tachycardic. His ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V6.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Unstable angina
B. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
C. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
D. Prinzmetal's angina
E. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient has classic symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation on ECG consistent with STEMI, which can be caused by plaque rupture or thrombosis in the coronary arteries leading to complete occlusion of blood flow to the heart muscle.

Question
A 4-year-old child presents with a high-grade fever, rash, and redness of the eyes. The child has been unwell for the past five days and is not responding to antibiotics. On examination, the child has bilateral conjunctivitis, cracked lips, strawberry tongue, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Blood tests reveal an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count.
Which one of the following is true regarding Kawasaki disease? 

A. It is caused by a bacterial infection
B. It primarily affects children under 1 year old
C. Treatment involves administration of corticosteroids
D. Coronary artery aneurysms are a common complication
E. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a skin biopsy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness that primarily affects young children. Its cause remains unknown but it is thought to involve an abnormal immune response triggered by an infectious agent or toxin exposure. Treatment typically involves intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin therapy to reduce inflammation and prevent coronary artery damage. However, some patients may require additional treatment with corticosteroids if they do not respond adequately to IVIG alone. One of the most serious complications of Kawasaki disease is coronary artery aneurysm formation which can lead to myocardial infarction or sudden death.

Question
A 2-year-old girl presents with persistent fever for more than 5 days along with other symptoms such as redness of eyes, dry cracked lips, peeling skin on fingers and toes, and swollen lymph nodes in her neck region. She was previously healthy without any significant medical history or family history of similar illnesses.
Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in confirming the diagnosis? 

A. Chest X-ray 
B. Echocardiogram 
C. CT scan 
D. Lumbar puncture 
E. Blood culture 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: An echocardiogram is the most helpful investigation in confirming the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease as it can detect coronary artery abnormalities such as aneurysms or stenosis. Other investigations may be useful to rule out other causes of fever and rash, but they are not specific for Kawasaki disease.

Question
A 5-year-old boy presents with a high-grade fever, swollen lymph nodes, and redness of eyes. He was previously healthy without any significant medical history or family history of similar illnesses.
Which one of the following clinical features would be least suggestive of Kawasaki disease? 

A. Bilateral conjunctivitis
B. Strawberry tongue
C. Cracked lips
D. Desquamation of the skin on hands and feet
E. Generalized urticarial rash

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: While a generalized urticarial rash can occur in some patients with Kawasaki disease, it is not considered a typical feature of this condition. The other symptoms listed (bilateral conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, cracked lips, and desquamation) are more commonly seen in patients with Kawasaki disease and should raise suspicion for this diagnosis when present along with persistent fever for more than 5 days.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue, night sweats and weight loss over the past few months. She has a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma which was treated successfully with chemotherapy two years ago. On examination, she is found to have splenomegaly and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in her neck, axilla and groin. Blood tests reveal pancytopenia and bone marrow biopsy shows infiltration by abnormal cells with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Which type of leukaemia is most likely? 

A. Acute myeloid leukaemia
B. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
C. Hairy cell leukaemia
D. T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia
E. B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests relapse of her previous Hodgkin's lymphoma; however, the presence of abnormal cells on bone marrow biopsy indicates a new diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Pancytopenia is common in ALL due to replacement of normal haematopoietic cells by malignant blasts.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to his GP with symptoms suggestive of anaemia such as fatigue, pallor and shortness of breath on exertion for several weeks. His blood test reveals severe normocytic anaemia along with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Further investigations show that he has an enlarged spleen but no other organomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrates hypercellularity with increased numbers of immature myeloid precursors showing dysplastic features including hypogranular cytoplasm and pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly in some neutrophils. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Myelodysplastic syndrome
B. Acute myeloid leukaemia with myelodysplasia-related changes
C. Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia
D. Refractory anaemia with excess blasts-2 
E. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes, which is a subtype of AML that arises from pre-existing MDS or MDS/MPN and has a worse prognosis than de novo AML.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the haematology clinic for follow-up after being diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) two years ago. He reports feeling well but on examination, he is found to have enlarged cervical and axillary lymph nodes along with splenomegaly. Blood tests reveal progressive lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia compared to his previous results six months ago. Flow cytometry analysis shows an increase in CD38 expression on CLL cells compared to baseline levels. Which of the following treatment options would be most appropriate? 

A. Watchful waiting
B. Fludarabine monotherapy
C. Rituximab monotherapy
D. Bendamustine plus rituximab combination therapy
E. Ibrutinib monotherapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical features suggest disease progression despite initial watchful waiting approach; therefore, treatment should be initiated at this point according to current guidelines for CLL management. Bendamustine plus rituximab combination therapy is one of the standard first-line treatment options for CLL patients who are fit enough for chemotherapy-based regimens and have no contraindications such as renal impairment or prior exposure to purine analogues. CD38 expression is a negative prognostic factor in CLL and may indicate more aggressive disease biology.

Question
A 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presents to the emergency department with jaundice, ascites, and encephalopathy. His liver function tests show elevated bilirubin levels, low albumin levels, and prolonged prothrombin time.

Explanation: Patients with cirrhosis are at risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss over the past few months. She has a history of autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus.
Physical examination reveals hepatomegaly and laboratory studies show elevated liver enzymes along with positive autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA).
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
B. Alcoholic hepatitis 
C. Primary biliary cholangitis 
D. Wilson's disease 
E. Hemochromatosis 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presence of positive autoantibodies such as ANA and ASMA along with hepatomegaly suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), an autoimmune disorder affecting the bile ducts.

Question
A 58-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently drinking 12 units of alcohol per day.
Physical examination reveals jaundice and laboratory studies show elevated bilirubin levels along with prolonged prothrombin time.
Further investigations reveal that he has cirrhosis of the liver with portal hypertension and ascites. He is started on medical management for his symptoms.
Which of the following medications should be avoided in this patient? 

A. Paracetamol 
B. Aspirin 
C. Ibuprofen
D. Morphine 
E. Codeine

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy when exposed to opioids such as morphine due to decreased metabolism by the liver. Therefore, it should be avoided or used with caution in these patients.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a comminuted fracture of his right femur after a high-speed motor vehicle accident. He has multiple other injuries, including rib fractures and a head injury. The patient is haemodynamically unstable, requiring resuscitation with fluids and blood products. After initial stabilisation, he undergoes an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of his femoral fracture. Post-operatively, he develops compartment syndrome in his thigh, which requires urgent fasciotomy.

Which one of the following statements regarding compartment syndrome is CORRECT? 

A. Compartment syndrome results from increased pressure within a closed space that compromises the circulation and function of tissues within that space.
B. It usually occurs immediately following trauma or surgery.
C. Symptoms include pain out of proportion to the injury, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia and paralysis.
D. Treatment involves immediate surgical decompression by performing fasciotomy.
E. All of the above are correct.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Compartment syndrome is caused by increased pressure within a closed anatomical space that leads to compromised tissue perfusion and function due to decreased capillary perfusion pressure leading to ischemia and necrosis if not treated promptly. This can occur acutely following trauma or surgery but may also develop slowly over time in chronic conditions such as exertional compartment syndrome or vascular occlusive disease.

Symptoms include pain out of proportion to the injury site, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia and paralysis; these symptoms should prompt clinical suspicion for this condition.

Treatment involves immediate surgical decompression via fasciotomy to relieve pressure on affected structures.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with severe pain in her left ankle after falling down stairs at home. She reports hearing a loud snap followed by immediate onset of pain and swelling around her ankle joint area; she is unable to bear weight on the affected limb. Examination reveals significant swelling and tenderness over the medial malleolus with ecchymosis extending up her leg. X-ray shows a displaced oblique fracture of the medial malleolus.

Which one of the following statements regarding ankle fractures is CORRECT? 

A. Ankle fractures are classified according to their location as either supramalleolar or inframalleolar.
B. Weber classification system divides ankle fractures into three types based on the level of fibular fracture relative to the tibial plafond.
C. Maisonneuve fracture refers to an isolated transverse fracture of the distal third of the fibula, which results from external rotation forces applied to a plantar-flexed foot.
D. Treatment for stable ankle fractures involves immobilisation in a cast or boot for 6-8 weeks followed by physiotherapy.
E. Surgical fixation is recommended for unstable ankle fractures, including those with significant displacement, articular involvement or syndesmotic disruption.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Ankle fractures are common injuries that can occur due to twisting or direct trauma; they are classified according to their location as either supramalleolar (involving both tibia and fibula) or inframalleolar (isolated fibular or talar fractures).

The Weber classification system divides ankle fractures into three types based on the level of fibular fracture relative to the tibial plafond; type A involves a below-the-level-of-joint line fracture, type B involves at joint level and type C involves above-the-level-of-joint-line injury.

Maisonneuve fracture refers to an isolated transverse fracture of proximal third of fibula along with rupture/disruption of deltoid ligament which results from external rotation forces applied to a plantar-flexed foot.

Treatment for stable ankle fractures typically involves immobilisation in a cast or boot for 6-8 weeks followed by physiotherapy. Surgical fixation is recommended for unstable ankle fractures, including those with significant displacement, articular involvement or syndesmotic disruption.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department following a motorcycle accident. He has sustained an open fracture of his right tibia and fibula with extensive soft tissue damage; there is also evidence of vascular injury with absent distal pulses in his foot. The patient undergoes urgent surgical exploration and repair of the vessels, along with debridement and external fixation of the fracture site. Post-operatively, he develops signs of acute kidney injury (AKI) and requires renal replacement therapy.

Which one of the following statements regarding AKI is CORRECT? 

A. AKI is defined as an abrupt decrease in kidney function leading to retention of nitrogenous waste products such as creatinine and urea.
B. It can be classified into three stages based on serum creatinine levels and urine output.
C. Common causes include hypovolemia, sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs and obstruction.
D. Treatment involves supportive measures such as fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte imbalances and removal of offending agents.
E. Renal replacement therapy may be required if conservative measures fail or in cases where there are severe complications such as hyperkalemia or metabolic acidosis.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to a sudden decline in kidney function over hours to days resulting from various insults that cause cellular damage within the kidneys leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate(GFR). This results in accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like creatinine & urea which leads to clinical manifestations like oliguria/anuria ,fluid overload etc.

It can be classified into three stages based on serum creatinine levels and urine output criteria established by KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines.

Common causes of AKI include hypovolemia, sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs and obstruction. Treatment involves supportive measures such as fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte imbalances and removal of offending agents. Renal replacement therapy may be required if conservative measures fail or in cases where there are severe complications such as hyperkalemia or metabolic acidosis.

Question
A 56-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of fever, headache and myalgia for the past week. He reports that he had been camping in an area known for ticks and had removed one from his leg a few days prior to the onset of symptoms. On examination, there is no rash but there is mild tenderness on palpation over the right calf.

What investigations should be performed? 

A. Blood culture
B. Chest X-ray
C. CT scan of head
D. ELISA for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies 
E. MRI of lower limb

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation raises suspicion for Lyme disease given the history of tick exposure and constitutional symptoms such as fever, headache and myalgia. While a rash may not always be present in early Lyme disease, it is important to perform serological testing using an ELISA assay for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies as part of diagnostic workup.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with a red circular rash on her upper arm which she noticed after returning from a camping trip in Scotland two weeks ago. She reports feeling unwell with flu-like symptoms at the time but did not seek medical attention until now due to worsening fatigue and joint pain.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a severe headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia. He reports feeling unwell for the past few days and has had a fever of 39°C. On examination, he is found to have a petechial rash on his trunk and limbs.

A lumbar puncture is performed which shows an opening pressure of 30mm H2O, cloudy appearance, white cells count of 500/mm³ (90% neutrophils), protein level of 3g/L and glucose level of 1.5mmol/L.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Meningococcal meningitis
B. Pneumococcal meningitis
C. Tuberculous meningitis
D. Listeria monocytogenes meningitis
E. Viral meningitis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation with headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, fever and petechial rash suggests bacterial meningitis as opposed to viral or fungal causes. The high neutrophil count in CSF along with low glucose levels indicates acute bacterial infection rather than chronic or viral infections such as TB or herpes simplex virus encephalitis respectively. The presence of petechiae raises suspicion for Neisseria meningitidis infection.

Question
A previously healthy 25-year-old woman presents with a sudden onset of confusion, seizures and altered mental status over the course of several hours. She has no history of recent illness but reports having travelled abroad recently.

On examination she has nuchal rigidity and positive Brudzinski sign.

CT scan reveals no abnormalities but lumbar puncture shows elevated opening pressure at 35mmH2O with turbid CSF containing WBCs >1000/µL (80% lymphocytes) and RBCs <10/µL; glucose 2.0 mmol/L and protein 3.5 g/L.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute bacterial meningitis
B. Viral encephalitis
C. Cryptococcal meningitis
D. Tuberculous meningitis
E. Aseptic meningitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation with altered mental status, seizures, nuchal rigidity and recent travel history raises suspicion for an infectious cause of her symptoms such as cryptococcal meningitis which can occur in immunocompetent individuals who have travelled to endemic areas. The elevated opening pressure along with turbid CSF containing high lymphocyte count suggests fungal rather than bacterial or viral infection.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a headache, fever, photophobia and neck stiffness that has been worsening over the past few days. He reports having recently returned from a trip to Africa where he had been bitten by mosquitoes.

On examination, he is found to have a petechial rash on his trunk and limbs.

CT scan reveals no abnormalities but lumbar puncture shows elevated opening pressure at 30mmH2O with clear CSF containing WBCs <10/µL (90% lymphocytes) and RBCs <10/µL; glucose 4.0 mmol/L and protein 1 g/L.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Meningococcal meningitis 
B. Pneumococcal meningitis 
C. Tuberculous meningitis 
D. West Nile virus encephalitis 
E. Japanese encephalitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's recent travel history along with mosquito bite exposure increases the likelihood of arboviral infections such as West Nile virus or Japanese encephalitis causing his symptoms however these infections would typically present with higher CSF WBC counts and elevated protein levels. The presence of petechiae raises suspicion for meningococcal infection however the clear CSF along with low WBC count suggests a less severe form of meningitis such as viral or fungal etiology.

Question
A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease presents to the emergency department with fever, tachycardia, hypotension and altered mental status. On examination, he is found to have jaundice, hepatomegaly and ascites. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin and creatinine levels along with thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. Imaging studies show evidence of acute renal failure, hepatic congestion and splenomegaly. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation? 

A. Acute pancreatitis
B. Septic shock 
C. Multiple myeloma 
D. Autoimmune hepatitis 
E. Viral hepatitis 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical picture described in this question is consistent with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which refers to progressive organ failure that occurs as a result of an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response to a variety of insults such as sepsis, trauma or burns. In this case, the presence of fever, tachycardia and hypotension suggest septic shock as the underlying cause of MODS. The patient's laboratory findings are also suggestive of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction including acute renal failure (elevated creatinine), hepatic congestion (elevated liver enzymes) and thrombocytopenia/leukocytosis (indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation). Jaundice, hepatomegaly and ascites are additional features that may be seen in severe cases of sepsis-associated MODS.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, cough and chest pain for the past week. She has a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy two years ago but has been otherwise healthy since then. On examination, she is found to have tachypnea, tachycardia and hypotension. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Laboratory investigations reveal elevated lactate levels, metabolic acidosis and evidence of coagulopathy. Which of the following interventions is most appropriate in this patient? 

A. High-dose corticosteroids 
B. Invasive mechanical ventilation 
C. Continuous renal replacement therapy 
D. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
E. Intravenous immunoglobulin 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical picture described in this question is suggestive of ARDS-associated MODS, which can occur as a result of direct or indirect lung injury leading to diffuse alveolar damage and impaired gas exchange. The presence of hypotension, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy suggest that the patient has developed severe sepsis or septic shock in addition to ARDS. In such cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered as a rescue therapy for refractory hypoxemia despite maximal conventional ventilatory support. ECMO involves cannulation of large veins/arteries to provide veno-venous or veno-arterial bypass circulation while allowing time for recovery from underlying pathology causing MODS.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with fever, abdominal pain and vomiting for the past two days. He has a history of alcohol abuse but denies any recent episodes of binge drinking or illicit drug use. On examination, he is found to have jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and ascites along with signs of peritoneal irritation on palpation. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin and creatinine levels along with thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. Imaging studies show evidence of hepatic necrosis, portal vein thrombosis and splenic infarction. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute pancreatitis 
B. Alcoholic hepatitis 
C. Ischemic bowel disease 
D. Hepatocellular carcinoma 
E. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical picture described in this question is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis (AH), which is a form of acute-on-chronic liver failure that can occur as a result of heavy alcohol consumption over many years. AH typically presents with fever, abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly along with laboratory evidence of elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin and coagulopathy. In severe cases, AH may progress to hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure or sepsis-associated MODS as seen in this patient's presentation. Imaging studies may show features of hepatic necrosis, portal hypertension or splenic infarction depending on the severity of underlying pathology causing MODS in AH patients.

Question
A 58-year-old female patient presents with a history of recurrent infections, fatigue, and bone pain for the past six months. Blood tests reveal normocytic anaemia, hypercalcaemia, and renal impairment. The serum protein electrophoresis shows an M-spike in the gamma region, and immunofixation confirms IgG kappa monoclonal gammopathy. Bone marrow biopsy reveals more than 30% plasma cells.

Which one of the following genetic abnormalities is most commonly associated with this condition? 

A. t(4;14)
B. del(17p)
C. t(11;14)
D. trisomy 21
E. t(14;16)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Multiple myeloma is a clonal disorder characterized by proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow leading to lytic bone lesions, anaemia, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 are common in multiple myeloma patients. The most frequent translocation involves chromosome 4q16 (FGFR3/MMSET) and chromosome 14q32 (IGH), resulting in overexpression of MMSET oncogene that promotes cell growth and survival.

Question
A 72-year-old male patient presents with back pain radiating down his legs for two weeks along with weakness in both lower limbs. MRI scan shows spinal cord compression due to vertebral collapse at T12 level along with multiple lytic lesions throughout the spine and pelvis.

What is the best initial management approach for this patient? 

A. Radiotherapy alone
B. Chemotherapy alone
C. Surgery followed by chemotherapy
D. Bisphosphonates only 
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Spinal cord compression is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent permanent neurological damage. The treatment of multiple myeloma depends on the stage and extent of disease, patient age and comorbidities, and response to therapy. In patients with symptomatic spinal cord compression due to vertebral collapse or epidural mass effect, surgical decompression followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and improve functional outcomes.

Question
A 60-year-old female patient presents with a history of recurrent infections, fatigue, bone pain, and weight loss for the past six months. Blood tests reveal normocytic anaemia, hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Serum protein electrophoresis shows an M-spike in the gamma region, and immunofixation confirms IgG lambda monoclonal gammopathy. Bone marrow biopsy reveals more than 50% plasma cells.

Which one of the following cytogenetic abnormalities is associated with poor prognosis? 

A. t(4;14)
B. del(17p)
C. t(11;14)
D. trisomy 21
E. t(14;16)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous disease with variable clinical course and outcome depending on several factors including age at diagnosis, performance status, laboratory parameters such as beta-2 microglobulin and LDH levels, cytogenetic abnormalities detected by FISH analysis or karyotyping, and response to therapy. Del(17p) is a high-risk cytogenetic abnormality that occurs in about 10% of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and is associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). It results in loss of TP53 tumor suppressor gene function leading to genomic instability and resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the DMD gene located on the X chromosome, which codes for the protein dystrophin. It follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, meaning that males are more commonly affected than females as they only inherit one copy of the X chromosome from their mother, who can be a carrier of the mutated gene without showing symptoms.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents with progressive muscle weakness starting in his pelvic muscles and spreading to his upper limbs over several years. He reports difficulty standing up from a seated position and climbing stairs due to his weak leg muscles, as well as difficulty lifting objects above shoulder height due to his weak arm muscles. On examination, there is atrophy of his thigh muscles and hypertrophy of his calf muscles.

A. Becker's muscular dystrophy
B. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D
C. Congenital muscular dystrophy
D. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
E. Myotonic dystrophy type 1

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient most likely has limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D, which is characterized by progressive weakness and wasting of the hip and shoulder girdle muscles that usually begins in childhood or adolescence. There is no pseudohypertrophy, and creatine kinase levels may be normal or only mildly elevated. The condition follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

Question
A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of weakness in his limbs and difficulty breathing. On examination, he has bilateral ptosis, diplopia, and proximal muscle weakness. He also reports dysphagia and difficulty speaking. His medical history is significant for thymoma which was surgically removed 10 years ago. The initial investigations reveal elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. Intravenous immunoglobulin
B. Plasmapheresis
C. High-dose corticosteroids
D. Azathioprine
E. Cyclosporine

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient presents with an acute exacerbation of myasthenia gravis (MG) symptoms which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly. The first step in management should be plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin to remove circulating acetylcholine receptor antibodies that are causing the disease process.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with fluctuating weakness in her upper limbs which worsens towards the end of the day and improves after rest or sleep. She also reports double vision and drooping of her eyelids during episodes of weakness but denies any bulbar symptoms or respiratory distress.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with a 3-month history of progressive muscle weakness in his limbs. He also reports difficulty swallowing and speaking, along with fatigue and weight loss. On examination, he has bilateral ptosis, diplopia, and proximal muscle weakness.

What is the most appropriate initial investigation? 

A. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies 
B. Electromyography (EMG) 
C. Muscle biopsy 
D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain 
E. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The most appropriate initial investigation for suspected myasthenia gravis (MG) is acetylcholine receptor antibody testing which can confirm the diagnosis in up to 85% of cases. EMG may be used to assess neuromuscular transmission but is not specific for MG while muscle biopsy is rarely needed for diagnosis. MRI or CT scans are useful for identifying thymoma which may be associated with MG but are not diagnostic tests for MG itself.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with fatigue, night sweats and weight loss over the past few months. On examination, she has splenomegaly and her blood counts reveal leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and anemia. The bone marrow biopsy shows hypercellularity with increased megakaryocytes.

A 32-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of chest pain, palpitations and shortness of breath for the past week. He has no significant medical history but reports having had a flu-like illness two weeks ago which resolved spontaneously. On examination, he is tachycardic (120 bpm) and has bibasal crepitations on lung auscultation. His ECG shows sinus tachycardia with ST-segment elevation in leads II, III and aVF. Blood tests reveal elevated cardiac enzymes consistent with myocarditis.
What is the most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm this patient's diagnosis? 

A. Chest X-ray
B. Echocardiogram
C. Cardiac MRI
D. Coronary angiography
E. Endomyocardial biopsy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The gold standard for diagnosing myocarditis is endomyocardial biopsy which can demonstrate inflammatory infiltrates within the myocardium along with myocyte necrosis and fibrosis. Other investigations such as echocardiography, cardiac MRI or coronary angiography may be useful adjuncts but cannot definitively diagnose myocarditis without histological confirmation from an endomyocardial biopsy specimen.

Question
A 1-day-old neonate is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress syndrome due to prematurity (born at 28 weeks gestation). On day 3 of life, he develops feeding intolerance followed by bilious vomiting and bloody stool over the next few hours associated with worsening respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation support. On examination, there is generalized abdominal distension noted without any palpable mass or tenderness; however, bowel sounds are absent on auscultation. An abdominal X-ray shows dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels suggestive of obstruction; no evidence of pneumatosis intestinalis or portal venous gas was detected on imaging studies. What is the most likely underlying condition? 

A. Necrotizing enterocolitis 
B. Meconium ileus 
C. Hirschsprung's disease 
D. Volvulus 
E. Malrotation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation and radiological findings are suggestive of midgut volvulus - a surgical emergency that occurs when the small bowel twists around its mesentery, leading to obstruction of blood supply and subsequent ischemia. Midgut volvulus is commonly seen in premature infants with malrotation or other congenital anomalies; however, it can also occur in full-term newborns without any underlying anatomical defects. The clinical features include sudden onset of bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, absent bowel sounds, and signs of sepsis like fever, tachycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, etc., along with radiological evidence of dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels on an abdominal X-ray.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease presents to the emergency department with severe pain and swelling in his left thigh.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of joint pain in her knees and hips for the past year. She reports no significant medical history or family history of chronic illnesses but admits to being overweight and leading a sedentary lifestyle. On examination, her BMI is 35 kg/m2, blood pressure is normal, and there is tenderness on palpation over both knees and hips with no other abnormalities noted. Which of the following interventions would be most effective in managing this patient's symptoms? 

A. Prescribing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
B. Referring the patient for bariatric surgery 
C. Recommending low-impact exercises such as swimming or cycling 
D. Administering corticosteroid injections into affected joints 
E. Advising the patient to lose weight through diet and exercise

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Weight loss through diet and exercise has been shown to improve joint pain in obese patients by reducing stress on weight-bearing joints such as the knees and hips.

Question
A 28-year-old woman with a BMI of 42 kg/m² presents for her first antenatal appointment at 12 weeks gestation. She has a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is poorly controlled despite being on metformin and insulin therapy. On examination, she has elevated blood pressure readings and proteinuria. An ultrasound shows fetal growth restriction.
Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate to improve maternal and fetal outcomes in this patient? 

A. Bariatric surgery
B. Continuous glucose monitoring
C. Early delivery via caesarean section 
D. Intensive lifestyle modification program 
E. Maternal corticosteroid administration

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This question tests the candidate's knowledge of management strategies for obese pregnant women with comorbidities such as PCOS and diabetes mellitus, who are at high risk for developing pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. While bariatric surgery may be considered in some cases, it is not recommended during pregnancy due to potential risks to both mother and fetus. Continuous glucose monitoring can help optimize glycemic control but does not address other factors contributing to adverse outcomes in this patient population. Early delivery via caesarean section may be indicated in certain circumstances but should not be the first-line intervention in this case. Maternal corticosteroid administration is used primarily for accelerating fetal lung maturation before preterm birth rather than improving maternal or fetal outcomes per se.

Question
A 32-year-old woman with a BMI of 35 kg/m² presents at 20 weeks gestation with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever for the past two days. She reports having had unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners since becoming pregnant but denies any drug use or recent travel outside the UK.
Which of the following conditions should be included in the differential diagnosis? 

A. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
B. Cholecystitis
C. HELLP syndrome 
D. Pyelonephritis 
E. Septicemia

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This question assesses the candidate's ability to recognize and differentiate between common causes of fever and abdominal symptoms in obese pregnant women, who are at increased risk for infections such as pyelonephritis and septicemia due to altered immune function and impaired wound healing. While acute fatty liver of pregnancy, cholecystitis, and HELLP syndrome can also present with similar symptoms, they are less likely given the patient's history of unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners.

Question
A 37-year-old woman with a BMI of 40 kg/m² presents at 36 weeks gestation with complaints of decreased fetal movements over the past day. She has a history of hypertension that is well-controlled on labetalol, but no other significant medical or obstetric history.
Which of the following tests would be most appropriate to evaluate fetal well-being? 

A. Amniocentesis for lung maturity 
B. Biophysical profile 
C. Fetal fibronectin assay 
D. Non-stress test 
E. Ultrasound for cervical length measurement

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This question evaluates the candidate's knowledge of antenatal surveillance strategies for obese pregnant women, who are at higher risk for adverse perinatal outcomes such as stillbirths and macrosomia due to placental dysfunction and uterine compression from excess adipose tissue. While amniocentesis for lung maturity may be indicated if preterm delivery is anticipated, it does not provide information about fetal well-being per se. The fetal fibronectin assay is used primarily for predicting preterm labor rather than assessing fetal status directly. The non-stress test and ultrasound for cervical length measurement are useful screening tests but may not provide sufficient information in cases of suspected fetal compromise. The biophysical profile, which combines fetal heart rate monitoring with ultrasound assessment of fetal breathing movements, gross body movements, tone, and amniotic fluid volume, is the most comprehensive tool for evaluating fetal well-being in this scenario.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her ophthalmologist with sudden onset of vision loss in her left eye, which started two days ago. She reports pain on eye movement and a central scotoma. On examination, there is reduced visual acuity in the affected eye, relative afferent pupillary defect, and optic disc swelling. The ophthalmologist suspects optic neuritis and orders an MRI scan of the brain and orbits. The MRI shows multiple white matter lesions consistent with demyelination, but no other abnormalities are detected. The patient is referred to a neurologist for further evaluation.
Which one of the following tests would be most helpful in confirming the diagnosis? 

A. Visual evoked potentials
B. Lumbar puncture
C. Electroencephalography
D. CT scan of the head
E. PET scan

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Visual evoked potentials (VEP) measure electrical activity generated by the visual system in response to light stimulation. In patients with optic neuritis, VEPs from the affected eye show delayed latency or reduced amplitude compared to those from the unaffected eye or normal controls. VEP can help confirm the diagnosis of optic neuritis and assess its severity.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to his GP with blurred vision in his right eye that started three days ago without any apparent cause or trauma history. He reports pain on moving his eyes and seeing flashing lights occasionally before losing vision completely in his right eye temporarily for about 10 minutes at a time over several hours during these past few days.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with migraine with aura, which can cause temporary vision loss, flashing lights, and headache. However, optic neuritis should also be considered as a possible diagnosis given the presence of pain on eye movement and swollen optic disc.

Question
A 26-year-old woman presents to her ophthalmologist with recurrent episodes of blurred vision in both eyes that last for several days before resolving spontaneously over the past year. She reports no pain or redness in her eyes during these episodes but does experience tingling sensations in her hands and feet at times.
On examination, there is reduced visual acuity bilaterally, relative afferent pupillary defect, and optic disc pallor.
Which one of the following tests would be most helpful in differentiating between multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica? 

A. MRI scan of the brain
B. Lumbar puncture
C. Visual evoked potentials
D. Serum aquaporin-4 antibody test
E. Electromyography

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord similar to MS but has distinct clinical features and pathophysiology. NMO is associated with serum antibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel protein expressed on astrocytes in the central nervous system. Testing for AQP4 antibodies can help differentiate NMO from MS or other demyelinating disorders that share similar clinical presentations but have different treatment options and prognoses.

Question
A 60-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with a history of multiple fractures and severe back pain. She has been on long-term corticosteroid therapy for her autoimmune disease, which is currently in remission. Her DEXA scan shows a T-score of -3.5 at the lumbar spine and -2.8 at the femoral neck.

Which of the following investigations would be most useful to determine the underlying cause of her osteoporosis? 

A. Serum calcium levels
B. Serum vitamin D levels
C. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels
D. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels
E. Urinary calcium excretion

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's history of long-term corticosteroid use puts her at risk for secondary osteoporosis due to glucocorticoid-induced suppression of bone formation and increased bone resorption leading to decreased bone density and increased fracture risk. PTH plays an important role in regulating calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, so elevated or suppressed PTH levels can indicate primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism respectively, both of which can contribute to osteoporosis.

Question
A 75-year-old man presents with a recent hip fracture after a minor fall from standing height. He reports no significant medical history except for hypertension controlled by medication, but his family history reveals that his mother had multiple vertebral fractures in her late 70s.

What is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient? 

A. Prescribe bisphosphonates 
B. Order a DEXA scan 
C. Refer him for genetic testing 
D. Perform serum protein electrophoresis 
E. Screen him for coeliac disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's age, gender, and fragility fracture put him at high risk for osteoporosis. A DEXA scan is the gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk, so it should be performed to guide treatment decisions. Genetic testing may be considered in patients with early-onset or severe osteoporosis, but a family history of fractures alone does not warrant genetic testing. Serum protein electrophoresis would be indicated if multiple myeloma or other plasma cell dyscrasias were suspected based on clinical features or laboratory findings. Screening for coeliac disease may be appropriate in patients with unexplained malabsorption or iron deficiency anaemia, but it is not directly related to osteoporosis management.

Question
A 68-year-old woman presents with chronic back pain and height loss of 2 inches over the past year. She reports no significant medical history except for occasional use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for arthritis pain relief.

Which of the following imaging modalities is most appropriate to evaluate her spine? 

A. X-ray 
B. CT scan 
C. MRI 
D. PET scan 
E. Bone scintigraphy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's symptoms are suggestive of vertebral compression fractures, which are common complications of osteoporosis that can cause chronic pain and spinal deformity such as kyphosis (hunchback). X-rays are useful for detecting vertebral fractures but have limited sensitivity compared to more advanced imaging techniques like CT and MRI, which can provide detailed information about bone density, structure, and soft tissue involvement such as spinal cord compression or nerve root impingement. PET scans and bone scintigraphy are typically used to detect metastatic cancer or other skeletal abnormalities rather than primary osteoporotic fractures.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the GP with a history of recurrent otitis externa in her left ear for the past year. She reports that she has tried various over-the-counter remedies, including ear drops and olive oil, but none have provided any relief.

Explanation: In advanced-stage ovarian cancer (stage III or IV), primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended as it has been shown to improve overall survival compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with postmenopausal bleeding and lower abdominal discomfort for several weeks. Her last menstrual period was five years ago, and she has never used hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Pelvic examination reveals an enlarged uterus and an ultrasound scan confirms endometrial thickening greater than 4mm without any obvious masses in the ovaries or pelvis. Endometrial biopsy shows grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma confined to the endometrium but not involving the cervix or myometrium. What is the next best step? 

A. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
B. Hysteroscopy with resection of endometrial tumour
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pelvis
D. Repeat endometrial biopsy
E. Observation with repeat ultrasound in 3 months

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the standard treatment for early-stage endometrial cancer confined to the uterus, as it provides definitive surgical staging and eliminates the risk of ovarian or fallopian tube cancer.

Question
A 58-year-old woman presents with abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting for several weeks. She has a history of breast cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy five years ago. CT scan shows multiple peritoneal nodules and ascites suspicious for metastatic disease from an unknown primary tumour. CA125 level is elevated at 350 U/mL (normal range <35 U/mL). Diagnostic laparoscopy reveals extensive omental caking, peritoneal implants and small bowel involvement but no obvious ovarian masses or primary site identified. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Primary peritoneal carcinoma 
B. Ovarian cancer 
C. Colorectal cancer 
D. Gastric cancer 
E. Pancreatic cancer 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) is a rare malignancy that arises from the lining cells of the peritoneum and shares many clinical features with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, including ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis, elevated CA125 levels and lack of specific symptoms or signs related to the primary site of origin. PPC should be considered in patients who have undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy but are found to have no evidence of ovarian pathology on histology or imaging studies during surgery or follow-up evaluations.

Question

Question
A 70-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his right hip after a minor fall at home. The X-ray shows a pathological fracture of the femoral neck, and further investigations reveal multiple osteoblastic lesions throughout the skeleton.
The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for which he is on long-term steroid therapy. He also reports recent episodes of confusion, lethargy, and constipation.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Multiple myeloma
B. Metastatic prostate cancer
C. Hyperparathyroidism
D. Paget's disease of bone
E. Steroid-induced osteoporosis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Long-term steroid use can lead to secondary osteoporosis and an increased risk of pathological fractures, especially in patients with other risk factors such as COPD. The combination of osteoblastic lesions and confusion, lethargy, and constipation suggests possible hypercalcemia due to underlying bone disease or vitamin D deficiency caused by steroid therapy.

Question
A 68-year-old woman with a history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is admitted to the hospital for an elective hip replacement surgery. She has been on warfarin therapy for the past year and her most recent INR was within therapeutic range at 2.5. The surgical team plans to perform the procedure under regional anaesthesia, but there is concern about the risk of bleeding due to her anticoagulation therapy.

What would be the most appropriate management strategy for this patient's anticoagulation peri-operatively? Consider both pre-operative and post-operative management.

A. Stop warfarin 5 days prior to surgery and restart it 12 hours after surgery
B. Continue warfarin until the day before surgery and resume it once haemostasis is achieved
C. Switch from warfarin to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) 3 days prior to surgery and resume LMWH 24 hours after surgery
D. Initiate unfractionated heparin continuous infusion during surgery and continue it post-operatively until adequate haemostasis is achieved
E. Discontinue all anticoagulant therapy indefinitely

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient has a high risk of developing DVT following hip replacement surgery due to her previous history of DVTs, so discontinuing anticoagulant therapy altogether would not be appropriate. Continuing warfarin or switching to LMWH may increase bleeding risk during and after surgery, whereas stopping warfarin too early could result in inadequate prophylaxis against thromboembolic events. Therefore, initiation of unfractionated heparin continuous infusion during surgery followed by continuation post-operatively until adequate haemostasis is achieved would be the most appropriate management strategy.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with chest pain and shortness of breath while playing football with his friends. He is diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism and started on anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban. During follow-up, he reports experiencing recurrent episodes of chest pain and shortness of breath despite being compliant with his medication.

What would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's anticoagulation? 

A. Increase the dose of rivaroxaban
B. Switch to warfarin therapy
C. Add aspirin to his current regimen
D. Perform genetic testing for thrombophilia
E. Refer him for surgical intervention

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Recurrent thromboembolic events while on adequate anticoagulation therapy may indicate an underlying hypercoagulable state such as thrombophilia, which can be identified through genetic testing. Increasing the dose of rivaroxaban or switching to warfarin may not necessarily prevent future thrombotic events if there is an underlying predisposition to clotting. Adding aspirin to his current regimen may increase bleeding risk without providing additional benefit in preventing further clots. Surgical intervention would only be considered if there were specific indications such as massive pulmonary embolism or hemodynamic instability.

Question
A 62-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe headache and confusion, and is found to have a subdural haematoma on CT scan. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been taking dabigatran for stroke prevention for the past year.

What would be the most appropriate management strategy for this patient's anticoagulation? 

A. Discontinue dabigatran immediately 
B. Administer prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) 
C. Initiate unfractionated heparin continuous infusion 
D. Monitor coagulation parameters closely without any intervention 
E. Switch from dabigatran to low-molecular-weight heparin

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor that can increase the risk of bleeding, and in this case, may have contributed to the development of subdural haematoma. Discontinuing dabigatran alone may not be sufficient to reverse its anticoagulant effects quickly enough to prevent further bleeding. Administering prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) would provide rapid reversal of dabigatran's anticoagulant effect and reduce the risk of further bleeding. Initiation of unfractionated heparin continuous infusion or switching to low-molecular-weight heparin could increase the risk of bleeding without providing any additional benefit in this situation. Monitoring coagulation parameters closely without intervention may not be sufficient to prevent further bleeding in a patient with an acute subdural haematoma.

Question
A 72-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prior myocardial infarction presents to the clinic for follow-up after being started on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She reports experiencing frequent episodes of epigastric pain and indigestion since starting DAPT. On further questioning, she admits to taking over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for her osteoarthritis pain without consulting her physician. Which one of the following is the most appropriate management strategy? 

A. Discontinue both aspirin and clopidogrel immediately
B. Continue both aspirin and clopidogrel as prescribed
C. Switch from clopidogrel to prasugrel 
D. Add proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding while continuing DAPT
E. Stop NSAID use and continue DAPT

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This question tests the candidate's knowledge on drug interactions between NSAIDs and antiplatelet agents in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events such as those who have undergone PCI. The correct answer is option D because adding a PPI has been shown to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with concomitant use of NSAIDs and antiplatelet agents.

Question
A 65-year-old male patient with a history of atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department with acute onset left-sided weakness that began 2 hours ago while he was watching television at home.

Which one of the following antiplatelet medications should be initiated? 

A. Aspirin 75mg daily for 2 weeks and then clopidogrel 75mg daily lifelong
B. Aspirin 300 mg daily for 2 weeks then clopidogrel 75 mg daily lifelong
C. Aspirin 300mg for 3 months and then clopidogrel 75mg for 1 year
D. Aspirin 75mg daily for 1 year and then clopidogrel 75mg daily lifelong
E. Dipyridamole plus aspirin combination therapy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This question tests the candidate's knowledge on antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation who have suffered an ischemic stroke. The correct answer is option E because the combination of dipyridamole and aspirin has been shown to be more effective than either agent alone in reducing recurrent stroke risk in this patient population.

Question
A randomized controlled trial is conducted to compare the efficacy of ticagrelor versus prasugrel as adjunctive therapy to aspirin in patients undergoing PCI with stent placement. A total of 2000 patients were enrolled, with half receiving ticagrelor and half receiving prasugrel.

A. Ticagrelor was associated with a lower incidence of major bleeding events compared to prasugrel 
B. Prasugrel was associated with a higher rate of target lesion revascularization (TLR) compared to ticagrelor 
C. There was no significant difference between groups in terms of all-cause mortality or myocardial infarction (MI)
D. Ticagrelor had a significantly shorter duration of action compared to prasugrel 
E. Both drugs were equally effective at preventing stent thrombosis 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This question tests the candidate's ability to interpret clinical trial results and compare the efficacy of different antiplatelet agents in patients undergoing PCI. The correct answer is option C because the study found no significant difference between ticagrelor and prasugrel in terms of all-cause mortality or MI, although there were differences in bleeding events and TLR rates.

Explanation: This patient's presentation is suggestive of acute PID, but other causes such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) should be ruled out before initiating treatment with antibiotics. Testing for STIs including Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae should be performed, and treatment should be tailored based on the results of these tests.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of recurrent epigastric pain and vomiting for the past year. He has been taking over-the-counter antacids which provide temporary relief but the symptoms always recur after a few days. The patient reports that he has lost about 10 kg in weight over the last year, despite having a good appetite. Upper GI endoscopy reveals multiple gastric ulcers and biopsy confirms chronic active gastritis with no evidence of H.pylori infection. Further investigations reveal elevated serum levels of chromogranin A.

Which one of the following is most likely?

A. Chemical gastroduodenitis
B. Chronic atrophic gastritis
C. Infective gastritis
D. Pyloric stenosis
E. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), which is characterized by hypersecretion of acid due to a gastrin-secreting tumor called a gastrinoma, usually located in the pancreas or duodenum. This results in multiple peptic ulcers, often refractory to standard therapy, as seen in this case. Elevated serum levels of chromogranin A are commonly seen in patients with ZES and can be used as a marker for diagnosis.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of abdominal discomfort, bloating, nausea, and occasional vomiting for the past month. She also reports having dark tarry stools for the past week along with fatigue and weakness. Her medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled on medication.

Which one of the following is most likely?

A. Helicobacter pylori gastritis
B. Peptic ulcer disease
C. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor
D. Gastric lymphoma
E. Acute gastritis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), which can cause abdominal discomfort, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Dark tarry stools indicate upper gastrointestinal bleeding, a common complication of PUD. Iron-deficiency anemia is also commonly seen in patients with chronic blood loss due to PUD.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of recurrent epigastric pain for the past year. He reports that the pain occurs after meals and is relieved by antacids but always recurs after a few hours. He denies any history of vomiting or weight loss and has no significant medical history or family history of gastrointestinal diseases. Upper GI endoscopy reveals multiple gastric ulcers and biopsy confirms H.pylori infection.

Which one of the following is most appropriate?

A. Initiate treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) alone
B. Test for antibiotic resistance before initiating triple therapy
C. Refer for surgical intervention
D. Repeat endoscopy in 6 months to monitor healing status
E. Advise lifestyle modifications only

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of H.pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Triple therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin and amoxicillin/metronidazole is recommended as first-line treatment for H.pylori eradication; however, antibiotic resistance rates are increasing worldwide, making it important to test for resistance before initiating therapy to ensure successful eradication and prevent recurrence of symptoms or complications such as perforation or bleeding.

Question
A 65-year-old patient with a history of end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis presents to the emergency department with fever, abdominal pain, and cloudy peritoneal fluid. The treating physician suspects peritonitis and orders blood cultures, peritoneal fluid analysis, and imaging studies. The results show positive bacterial growth in both blood cultures and peritoneal fluid culture. Imaging studies reveal diffuse thickening of the peritoneum.
Which of the following is the most likely causative organism responsible for this patient's peritonitis? 

A. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
B. Staphylococcus aureus
C. Streptococcus agalactiae
D. Enterococcus faecalis
E. Escherichia coli

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Patients undergoing long-term peritoneal dialysis are at risk of developing catheter-related infections leading to peritonitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease presents to the clinic with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for one week. He has been taking mesalamine for his Crohn's disease but stopped it two weeks ago due to financial constraints. On examination, he has tenderness in the right lower quadrant without rebound tenderness or guarding.
Which of the following complications should be suspected? 

A. Bowel obstruction 
B. Diverticulitis 
C. Appendicitis 
D. Perforated peptic ulcer 
E. Peritonitis 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), discontinuation or non-adherence to medications can lead to flare-ups that may result in intra-abdominal abscesses or perforations causing secondary bacterial infections like peritonitis.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. She has a history of recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. On examination, she has diffuse abdominal tenderness with rebound tenderness and guarding.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute pancreatitis 
B. Cholangitis 
C. Biliary peritonitis 
D. Small bowel obstruction 
E. Appendicitis 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Biliary peritonitis is a rare but serious complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy that occurs due to bile leakage into the peritoneal cavity leading to chemical irritation and bacterial infection causing symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and leukocytosis.

Question
A 27-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of unstable relationships, impulsive behaviour and self-harm. She reports feeling empty inside and has made several suicide attempts in the past. On examination, she appears anxious and restless. Her mood is low, but there are no signs of psychosis or mania.

What personality disorder do these symptoms suggest? How would you differentiate it from other similar disorders? What treatment options are available for this patient?

A. Borderline personality disorder
B. Histrionic personality disorder
C. Narcissistic personality disorder
D. Antisocial personality disorder
E. Schizotypal personality disorder

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The symptoms described are characteristic of borderline personality disorder (BPD), which is characterized by instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image and affect, as well as impulsivity and suicidal behavior. BPD must be differentiated from other similar disorders such as histrionic personality disorder (HPD) or narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). HPD patients also have a tendency towards attention-seeking behaviour but lack the impulsivity and self-destructive tendencies seen in BPD patients while NPD patients have grandiose sense of self-importance and lack empathy but don't exhibit the same level of emotional dysregulation seen in BPD patients.

Treatment options for BPD include psychotherapy such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), antidepressants or antipsychotics if necessary.

Question
A 42-year-old man is referred to a psychiatrist by his GP due to concerns about his paranoid beliefs that people are out to get him at work and home. He reports being followed by strangers on the street who he believes are part of a conspiracy against him. He has become increasingly isolated over time due to his mistrustful nature.

What type of personality disorder best describes this patient? How would you differentiate it from other similar disorders? What treatment options are available for this patient?

A. Paranoid personality disorder
B. Schizotypal personality disorder
C. Borderline personality disorder
D. Avoidant personality disorder
E. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The symptoms described are characteristic of paranoid personality disorder (PPD), which is characterized by pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others, leading to a pattern of interpersonal difficulties. PPD must be differentiated from other similar disorders such as schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD). SPD patients may also have odd beliefs but tend to experience perceptual distortions while BPD patients exhibit emotional dysregulation and impulsivity.

Treatment options for PPD include psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy, antipsychotics if necessary.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with a history of social anxiety and avoidance behaviour since childhood. She reports feeling inadequate in social situations and fears being judged negatively by others. She avoids social gatherings and has few close friends.

What type of personality disorder best describes this patient? How would you differentiate it from other similar disorders? What treatment options are available for this patient?

A. Avoidant personality disorder
B. Dependent personality disorder
C. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
D. Schizoid personality disorder
E. Narcissistic Personality Disorder

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The symptoms described are characteristic of avoidant personality disorder (AVPD), which is characterized by feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and social inhibition that lead to restricted lifestyle patterns, including avoiding activities involving significant interpersonal contact due to fear of rejection or disapproval.

AVPD must be differentiated from other similar disorders such as dependent personality disorder (DPD) or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). DPD patients have a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and clinging behavior while OCPD patients are preoccupied with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.

Treatment options for AVPD include psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), group therapy or medication such as antidepressants.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents with a history of amenorrhea, galactorrhea and headache for the past six months. On examination, she has no visual field defects but her prolactin levels are elevated at 200 ng/mL (normal range: <20 ng/mL). MRI shows a pituitary macroadenoma measuring 2 cm in size that is compressing on the optic chiasm. She is started on dopamine agonist therapy to reduce the size of the tumour.

Which of the following is true regarding dopamine agonists? 

A. They have a high risk of causing hypotension
B. They can cause worsening of symptoms initially due to tumour swelling
C. They should be avoided in patients with hypertension
D. They can lead to increased risk of thromboembolic events
E. They are contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Dopamine agonists such as cabergoline or bromocriptine are used as first-line treatment for prolactinomas and other pituitary adenomas that secrete growth hormone or ACTH. However, they can cause an initial worsening of symptoms due to tumour swelling before reducing its size. Other side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and psychiatric disturbances.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents with features suggestive of Cushing's syndrome including central obesity, moon facies, easy bruising and muscle weakness over several months duration. His cortisol levels are found to be elevated at all times during the day (24-hour urinary free cortisol >3x upper limit) along with low plasma ACTH levels (<10 pg/ml). An MRI scan reveals a small pituitary microadenoma measuring less than 1cm in size.

What is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient? 

A. Transsphenoidal surgery
B. Medical therapy with ketoconazole and metyrapone
C. Radiation therapy
D. Observation with serial imaging and hormonal evaluation
E. Bilateral adrenalectomy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with Cushing's syndrome due to pituitary adenomas, transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment option for microadenomas (<1cm) while medical therapy is preferred in macroadenomas (>1 cm). Ketoconazole and metyrapone are commonly used drugs that inhibit cortisol synthesis and can be used as a bridge to surgery or radiation therapy.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents with symptoms of acromegaly including enlargement of hands and feet, coarse facial features, snoring, sleep apnea, hyperhidrosis, arthralgia and carpal tunnel syndrome over several years duration. His IGF-1 levels are elevated at 800 ng/mL (normal range: 100-300 ng/mL) along with high growth hormone levels on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). MRI scan reveals a large pituitary macroadenoma measuring more than 2 cm in size.

Which of the following is true regarding surgical management? 

A. Endoscopic endonasal approach has higher success rates compared to microscopic transsphenoidal approach 
B. Surgery should not be considered if there is optic chiasm compression 
C. Preoperative somatostatin analogue therapy can reduce tumour size and improve surgical outcomes 
D. Surgery carries a high risk of postoperative diabetes insipidus 
E. Radiotherapy should always be performed after surgery to prevent recurrence 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment for acromegaly caused by pituitary adenomas but preoperative somatostatin analogue therapy can help reduce tumour size, improve surgical outcomes and decrease perioperative morbidity. Endoscopic endonasal approach and microscopic transsphenoidal approach are both used for surgical management with similar success rates. Optic chiasm compression is an indication for surgery rather than a contraindication. Postoperative diabetes insipidus can occur in up to 20% of patients after pituitary surgery while radiotherapy may be considered as adjuvant therapy in cases of incomplete resection or recurrence.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 28 weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding. She has a history of two previous Caesarean sections and underwent in vitro fertilization for this pregnancy. On examination, her cervix is closed, and the foetal heart rate is reassuring. An ultrasound confirms placenta praevia with an anteriorly located placenta covering the internal os.

What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?

A. Expectant management
B. Immediate delivery via Caesarean section
C. Administration of corticosteroids followed by elective Caesarean section at 34 weeks gestation
D. Vaginal delivery if labour starts spontaneously before 34 weeks gestation
E. Hysterectomy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In cases of placenta praevia, early delivery may be necessary due to the risk of life-threatening haemorrhage during labour or delivery. However, premature delivery carries risks for both mother and baby, including respiratory distress syndrome and intraventricular haemorrhage in the neonate. The optimal timing of delivery depends on several factors, including gestational age, severity of bleeding, maternal and fetal condition, and location of the placenta relative to the cervical os.

In this case, administration of corticosteroids followed by elective Caesarean section at 34 weeks gestation would allow time for fetal lung maturation while minimizing the risk of severe bleeding associated with later delivery.

Question
A 36-year-old woman presents to antenatal clinic at 20 weeks gestation with painless vaginal bleeding that started earlier that day. Her medical history includes one previous Caesarean section and she had no complications during her first pregnancy.

On examination, her vital signs are stable but there is evidence of ongoing blood loss from her vagina.

An ultrasound scan shows a posterior placenta praevia with the edge of the placenta 2 cm from the internal os.

What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?

A. Expectant management
B. Immediate delivery via Caesarean section
C. Administration of corticosteroids followed by elective Caesarean section at 34 weeks gestation
D. Vaginal delivery if labour starts spontaneously before 37 weeks gestation
E. Hysterectomy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In cases of placenta praevia, expectant management may be appropriate in stable patients without significant bleeding or evidence of fetal compromise. This involves close monitoring of maternal and fetal status, including regular ultrasound scans to assess placental location and growth, as well as blood tests to monitor for anaemia.

In this case, since the patient is stable and there is no evidence of fetal distress, expectant management would be appropriate. The patient should be advised to avoid strenuous activity and sexual intercourse until further evaluation can be performed.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to antenatal clinic at 32 weeks gestation with painless vaginal bleeding that started earlier that day. Her medical history includes two previous uncomplicated vaginal deliveries.

On examination, her vital signs are stable but there is ongoing blood loss from her vagina.

An ultrasound scan shows a complete previa with the edge of the placenta covering the entire cervical os.

What is the most appropriate initial management plan for this patient?

A. Immediate delivery via Caesarean section
B. Administration of corticosteroids followed by elective Caesarean section at 34 weeks gestation
C. Admission to hospital for observation and bed rest
D. Blood transfusion and uterine artery embolization 
E. Hysterectomy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In cases of complete previa with active bleeding, immediate delivery via Caesarean section may be necessary to prevent life-threatening haemorrhage. However, in stable patients without significant bleeding or evidence of fetal distress, admission to hospital for observation and bed rest may be appropriate.

In this case, since the patient is stable and there is no evidence of fetal distress, admission to hospital for observation and bed rest would be appropriate. The patient should be advised to avoid strenuous activity and sexual intercourse until further evaluation can be performed. Close monitoring of maternal and fetal status, including regular ultrasound scans to assess placental location and growth, as well as blood tests to monitor for anaemia should also be done.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 36 weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. She reports a sudden onset of severe, crampy lower abdominal pain accompanied by heavy vaginal bleeding that started about an hour ago. The patient has no significant medical history except for hypertension which is well-controlled on medication. On examination, her abdomen is tender and there is uterine tenderness with contractions every five minutes lasting for 30 seconds each. Fetal heart rate monitoring shows late decelerations. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Placental abruption
B. Placenta previa 
C. Uterine rupture
D. Vasa previa 
E. Chorioamnionitis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This scenario describes a classic presentation of placental abruption, which occurs when the placenta separates from the uterus before delivery of the fetus, leading to fetal distress and maternal hemorrhage.

Question
A 28-year-old primigravida presents at 38 weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain after a fall down a flight of stairs earlier in the day. She reports having mild contractions but denies any leakage of amniotic fluid or previous complications during pregnancy. On examination, she appears anxious and distressed with moderate uterine tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness; cervical os is closed on speculum exam; CTG shows reassuring fetal heart rate pattern without decelerations or tachycardia; ultrasound reveals normal fetal growth parameters and placental location above the internal os without evidence of retroplacental clotting or hematoma formation.
What is the most appropriate management plan? 

A. Immediate caesarean section
B. Induction of labour
C. Expectant management with close observation 
D. Blood transfusion followed by induction
E. Emergency laparotomy

Correct Answer: C 

Explanation: This scenario describes a case of suspected placental abruption after trauma, which can be difficult to diagnose and manage. In this situation, expectant management with close observation is the most appropriate approach as there is no evidence of fetal distress or significant maternal hemorrhage.

Question
A 36-year-old woman presents at 30 weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. She reports having multiple previous miscarriages but has had an uncomplicated pregnancy so far. On examination, she appears pale and diaphoretic with severe uterine tenderness; cervical os is closed on speculum exam; CTG shows fetal bradycardia without variability or accelerations; ultrasound reveals retroplacental clotting measuring 5 cm in diameter.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Placenta previa
B. Placental abruption 
C. Uterine rupture
D. Vasa previa 
E. Chorioamnionitis

Correct Answer: B 

Explanation: This scenario describes a classic presentation of placental abruption with significant maternal hemorrhage leading to fetal distress and potential demise. The presence of a large retroplacental clot confirms the diagnosis and highlights the severity of the condition.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the emergency department with fever, cough and shortness of breath. He is hypoxic on room air and requires supplemental oxygen. Chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.

Further investigations reveal that he has a positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient is started on appropriate antibiotics but continues to deteriorate over the next few days, requiring mechanical ventilation.

What are some potential complications associated with this patient's pneumonia? 

A. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
B. Empyema
C. Lung abscess
D. Septic shock
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Patients with COPD are at increased risk for developing pneumonia due to impaired lung function and weakened immune systems. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in patients with underlying lung disease such as COPD or cystic fibrosis. Complications of severe pneumonia can include ARDS, empyema, lung abscess, and septic shock.

Question
An 82-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of fatigue, malaise and a persistent cough productive of yellow-green sputum for the past week. She denies any chest pain or shortness of breath but reports feeling more tired than usual lately.

On examination, she appears unwell and has crackles heard throughout both lungs on auscultation.

Laboratory investigations show elevated inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Chest x-ray reveals patchy airspace opacities throughout both lungs consistent with community-acquired pneumonia.

Which one of the following organisms is most likely responsible for her infection? 

A. Haemophilus influenzae 
B. Klebsiella pneumoniae 
C. Legionella pneumophila 
D. Mycoplasma pneumoniae
E. Streptococcus pneumoniae 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with community-acquired pneumonia, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens. In this case, the presence of yellow-green sputum and patchy airspace opacities on chest x-ray suggest a bacterial etiology. Given the patient's age and underlying comorbidities, Klebsiella pneumoniae is a likely culprit.

Question
A 25-year-old previously healthy man presents to his primary care physician with fever, cough and pleuritic chest pain for the past week. He reports no recent travel or sick contacts but does work in construction.

On examination, he appears uncomfortable and has decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung field on auscultation.

Chest x-ray reveals a small right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent parenchymal infiltrates.

Which one of the following organisms is most likely responsible for his infection? 

A. Haemophilus influenzae 
B. Klebsiella pneumoniae 
C. Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
D. Staphylococcus aureus
E. Streptococcus pneumoniae 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute bacterial infection such as community-acquired pneumonia or empyema (pus in the pleural space). The presence of a pleural effusion suggests that bacteria have spread beyond the lung parenchyma into adjacent tissues such as the pleura or chest wall. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections, including those involving the respiratory tract and soft tissues like skin and bone.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. He has a history of smoking and hypertension. On examination, he is tachycardic and tachypnoeic with decreased air entry on the right side of his chest. Chest x-ray confirms a large right-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift. The patient's condition deteriorates rapidly, and he becomes hypotensive and requires intubation for respiratory failure.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Immediate needle aspiration
B. Intercostal drain insertion under ultrasound guidance
C. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)
D. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)
E. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient has developed tension pneumothorax, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to prevent cardiovascular collapse. In this case, ECMO may be considered as a rescue therapy in patients who are refractory to conventional treatments such as needle aspiration or intercostal drain insertion.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents with mild dyspnea and left-sided pleuritic chest pain after an episode of coughing while lifting heavy weights at the gymnasium earlier in the day. She has no significant past medical history but smokes occasionally. Chest x-ray shows a small left-sided apical pneumothorax without any evidence of mediastinal shift or lung collapse.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Observation only
B. Aspiration using a 16G cannula
C. Intercostal drain insertion
D. Thoracoscopy-guided talc pleurodesis
E. Admit for observation

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Small asymptomatic pneumothoraces can be managed conservatively with observation and serial chest x-rays to monitor for resolution or progression. Aspiration may be considered if the patient develops symptoms or if the pneumothorax is larger than 2 cm.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of severe right-sided chest pain and dyspnea after a motor vehicle accident. He has multiple rib fractures on the right side, and chest x-ray confirms a large right-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift and lung collapse.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Intercostal drain insertion
B. Needle aspiration
C. Observation only
D. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)
E. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Traumatic pneumothorax with significant lung collapse requires immediate intervention with intercostal drain insertion to restore normal lung function and prevent complications such as tension pneumothorax or hemothorax.

Question
A 56-year-old male presents with fatigue, headaches and visual disturbances. His full blood count shows a haemoglobin level of 21 g/dL, platelet count of 400 * 10^9/L and white cell count of 12 * 10^9/L. On examination, he has splenomegaly and erythromelalgia. Further investigations reveal a JAK2 V617F mutation.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Essential thrombocythaemia
B. Polycythaemia vera
C. Chronic myeloid leukaemia
D. Myelodysplastic syndrome
E. Acute myeloid leukaemia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with polycythaemia vera (PV), which is characterized by increased red blood cell production leading to elevated haemoglobin levels, as well as increased platelets and white cells in some cases. The presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation is seen in over 95% of patients with PV, making it a useful diagnostic tool.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents with recurrent episodes of dizziness and confusion over the past month. Her full blood count reveals a haemoglobin level of 19 g/dL, platelet count of 300 * 10^9/L and white cell count of 8 * 10^9/L. She has no significant medical history but reports taking oral contraceptives for the past year.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms? 

A. Polycythaemia vera 
B. Essential thrombocythaemia 
C. Iron deficiency anaemia 
D. Vitamin B12 deficiency 
E. Thalassaemia minor 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with hyperviscosity syndrome, which can occur in patients with polycythaemia vera due to increased red blood cell production. The use of oral contraceptives may exacerbate the symptoms by increasing the risk of thrombosis. Iron deficiency anaemia, vitamin B12 deficiency and thalassaemia minor are unlikely causes given the patient's elevated haemoglobin level.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents with fatigue and abdominal discomfort over the past month. His full blood count reveals a haemoglobin level of 16 g/dL, platelet count of 400 * 10^9/L and white cell count of 15 * 10^9/L. Further investigations reveal a JAK2 exon 12 mutation.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Polycythaemia vera 
B. Essential thrombocythaemia 
C. Chronic myeloid leukaemia 
D. Myelodysplastic syndrome 
E. Acute myeloid leukaemia 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: While the JAK2 V617F mutation is more commonly associated with polycythaemia vera (PV), mutations in exon 12 have also been identified in a subset of PV cases that lack the V617F mutation. Patients with this type of PV tend to present at an older age and have lower haemoglobin levels compared to those with V617F-positive disease, but otherwise have similar clinical features including splenomegaly and erythromelalgia.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of severe pain and stiffness in his shoulders, hips, and neck for the past month. He also reports feeling extremely fatigued and has lost weight unintentionally. On examination, he has limited range of motion in his shoulder girdle and hip joints, but there is no evidence of joint swelling or redness. Blood tests reveal elevated inflammatory markers.

Which imaging modality would be most useful in confirming a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica?

A. X-ray
B. MRI
C. CT scan
D. Ultrasound
E. PET scan

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: While there is no definitive test for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), ultrasound can be helpful in identifying inflammation around affected joints and ruling out other causes of musculoskeletal pain.

Question
A 72-year-old woman with a history of PMR presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. An ECG reveals ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She is treated urgently with thrombolysis followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

What medication should be initiated as secondary prevention therapy? 

A. Aspirin only 
B. Clopidogrel only 
C. Aspirin plus clopidogrel 
D. Aspirin plus ticagrelor 
E. Ticagrelor only 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Patients who have had a STEMI are typically started on dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin plus another agent such as clopidogrel to reduce the risk of recurrent events.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of bilateral shoulder pain that has been present for several months, which he describes as dull and achy without radiation or weakness in either arm.He denies any other joint pain or stiffness. Examination reveals tenderness over the bursa and acromioclavicular joints bilaterally, with no evidence of synovitis.

Which of the following is a possible differential diagnosis? 

A. Rotator cuff tear 
B. Osteoarthritis 
C. Rheumatoid arthritis
D. Polymyalgia rheumatica 
E. Adhesive capsulitis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, can present with bilateral shoulder pain and stiffness without radiographic changes or weakness in the arms. It typically affects patients between 40-60 years old and may be associated with diabetes mellitus or thyroid disease.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe vaginal bleeding, two weeks after giving birth via caesarean section. Her vital signs are stable and she is alert and oriented. On examination, her uterus is soft and non-tender, but there is active bleeding from the cervical os. The patient's blood work reveals a haemoglobin level of 7 g/dL.
What is the most likely cause of this postpartum haemorrhage? 

A. Uterine atony
B. Retained placental tissue
C. Cervical laceration 
D. Coagulopathy 
E. Uterine rupture

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presentation suggests that the patient has a cervical laceration which can be caused by trauma during delivery or instrumentation used during the caesarean section procedure.

Question
A 32-year-old woman who had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery develops a primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony despite pharmacological management. She continues to bleed heavily even after receiving multiple doses of oxytocin, misoprostol and ergometrine maleate along with fluid resuscitation.
What would be your next step in managing this patient? 

A. Bilateral ligation of uterine arteries
B. Haemostatic brace suturing
C. Hysterectomy
D. Intrauterine balloon tamponade
E. Selective arterial embolization

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Intrauterine balloon tamponade can be used as a second-line intervention for PPH when medical management fails.

Question
A 29-year-old primigravida presents at term in labour with no significant past medical history or complications throughout pregnancy until now when she experiences heavy vaginal bleeding immediately following delivery of her baby boy. She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery with no instrumentation used and the placenta was delivered intact.
What is the most likely cause of this postpartum haemorrhage? 

A. Uterine atony
B. Retained placental tissue
C. Cervical laceration 
D. Coagulopathy 
E. Uterine rupture

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presentation suggests that the patient has experienced uterine rupture, which can be caused by previous caesarean section or other uterine surgeries, overdistension of the uterus from multiple gestations or polyhydramnios, or trauma during labour.

Question
A 29-year-old primigravida presents to the antenatal clinic at 32 weeks gestation with complaints of headache, epigastric pain and swelling in her lower limbs. Her blood pressure is found to be elevated at 160/100 mmHg and urine dipstick reveals proteinuria of +2. She has no significant past medical history and all routine investigations are within normal limits. The patient is diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and started on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. However, she develops severe respiratory distress, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

What is the most likely cause of her respiratory distress? 

A. Pulmonary edema
B. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
C. Pneumonia
D. Pulmonary embolism
E. Asthma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Pre-eclampsia can lead to ARDS due to increased capillary permeability leading to pulmonary edema, alveolar collapse, and surfactant dysfunction.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with a history of hypertension since early pregnancy which was managed with labetalol throughout her pregnancy until delivery at term without any complications. She now complains of persistent headaches, visual disturbances, nausea and vomiting postpartum on day 3 after discharge from hospital following an uncomplicated vaginal delivery.
Her blood pressure is recorded as 170/110 mmHg and examination reveals bilateral pitting pedal edema up to mid-calf level.

What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Observation only
B. Intravenous hydralazine infusion
C. Oral nifedipine
D. Sublingual nifedipine
E. Intravenous labetalol infusion

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Postpartum hypertension may occur in women who have had gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Intravenous labetalol infusion is the preferred choice of treatment in postpartum hypertension.

Question
A 28-year-old primigravida presents to the emergency department at 34 weeks gestation with complaints of headache, blurred vision and epigastric pain. She has a history of chronic hypertension which was well controlled on methyldopa before pregnancy but she stopped taking it after becoming pregnant. On examination, her blood pressure is found to be elevated at 170/110 mmHg and urine dipstick reveals proteinuria of +3.
She is diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia and started on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. However, she develops sudden onset dyspnea and chest pain.

What is the most likely cause? 

A. Pulmonary embolism
B. Acute myocardial infarction
C. Cardiomyopathy
D. Peripartum cardiomyopathy
E. Dissecting aortic aneurysm

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) can occur during late pregnancy or up to six months postpartum in previously healthy women. The symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, edema, coughing and palpitations. It may present as acute heart failure in severe cases like this patient who had severe pre-eclampsia.

Question
A 78-year-old patient with a history of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease is admitted to the hospital for cellulitis in his left leg. During the admission assessment, you notice a pressure sore on his right heel that has been present for several weeks. On examination, the wound measures 4cm x 3cm and extends down to the bone. There is no evidence of infection or necrosis. What grade of pressure sore would this be compatible with? Additionally, what are some potential complications associated with this type of pressure sore? 

A. EPUAP Grade/Stage II
B. EPUAP Grade/Stage III
C. EPUAP Grade/Stage IV
D. EPUAP Grade/Stage V
E. None of the above

What stage/grade would this be classified? Additionally, what interventions should be implemented at this stage? 

A. Stage I 
B. Stage II 
C. Stage III 
D. Stage IV 
E. Not enough information provided

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This question tests knowledge regarding early identification and management strategies for pressure sores. The description of the area of erythema over the sacrum that blanches but does not resolve immediately after removal of pressure is consistent with a Stage I pressure sore. At this stage, interventions should focus on relieving pressure and preventing further damage to the skin, such as repositioning the patient every 2 hours and using appropriate support surfaces.

Question
An elderly patient with dementia is admitted to your ward following a fall at home resulting in a hip fracture. During her admission assessment, you notice several areas of non-blanchable erythema over her heels and sacrum that are warm to touch. What stage/grade would these be classified? Additionally, what additional assessments should be performed? 

A. Stage I 
B. Stage II 
C. Stage III 
D. Stage IV 
E. Not enough information provided

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This question requires knowledge regarding the different stages of pressure sores as well as their risk factors and associated assessments. The description of non-blanchable erythema over bony prominences that are warm to touch suggests a Stage II pressure sore due to partial thickness skin loss involving the epidermis or dermis. Additional assessments that should be performed include evaluating for signs of infection or necrosis, assessing nutritional status, and identifying any contributing factors such as immobility or incontinence.

A 50-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air, and his respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute. A CTPA confirms the presence of bilateral segmental PEs.

Which one of the following medications should be avoided in this patient? 

A. Heparin 
B. Enoxaparin 
C. Warfarin 
D. Apixaban 
E. Rivaroxaban

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Patients with COPD are at increased risk for bleeding complications from anticoagulant therapy due to their underlying lung disease and frequent use of corticosteroids. Therefore, warfarin, which has a narrow therapeutic window and requires frequent monitoring, should be avoided if possible in these patients. Direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban or rivaroxaban may be safer alternatives but still require careful consideration of risks versus benefits in each individual case.

A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with severe shortness of breath and chest pain. She has a past medical history significant for systemic lupus erythematosus, Raynaud's phenomenon, and scleroderma. On examination, she is tachypneic with bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. An echocardiogram reveals dilated right ventricle and atrium with tricuspid regurgitation and an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 80 mmHg. A computed tomography angiogram shows no evidence of pulmonary embolism but demonstrates diffuse interstitial fibrosis in both lungs.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
B. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease
C. Connective tissue disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension
D. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension
E. Sarcoidosis-associated pulmonary hypertension

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with connective tissue disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (CTD-PAH), which can occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma as seen in this case. The presence of interstitial fibrosis suggests underlying parenchymal lung disease associated with CTD-PAH.

Question
A 55-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and peripheral edema that has been progressively worsening over the last few months. He has a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease status post-percutaneous coronary intervention two years ago.
On examination, he has elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral lower extremity pitting edema up to mid-calf level, and hepatomegaly without jaundice or ascites. An echocardiogram shows severe tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 90 mmHg.

What is the most likely cause of his pulmonary hypertension? 

A. COPD-associated pulmonary hypertension
B. Left heart disease-associated pulmonary hypertension
C. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
D. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension
E. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and findings on examination suggest left heart disease as the underlying cause of his pulmonary hypertension, specifically due to severe tricuspid regurgitation secondary to right ventricular dysfunction from left-sided heart failure.

Question

She has a past medical history significant for systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome, both well-controlled on medications including hydroxychloroquine and low molecular weight heparin.
On examination, she appears well with no respiratory distress or peripheral edema. However, an echocardiogram reveals mild-to-moderate right ventricular dilation and hypertrophy with an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 45 mmHg.

What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Referral for urgent cardiac catheterization and initiation of prostacyclin therapy
B. Initiation of sildenafil therapy in consultation with cardiology
C. Close monitoring without intervention unless symptoms develop or hemodynamics worsen
D. Immediate delivery via cesarean section followed by evaluation for lung transplant candidacy 
E. Administration of intravenous epoprostenol during labor and delivery

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests mild-to-moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) likely related to her underlying autoimmune diseases but without significant hemodynamic compromise or symptoms. Close monitoring without intervention is appropriate, with consideration for initiation of PAH-specific therapy if hemodynamics worsen or symptoms develop. Delivery should be planned in consultation with obstetrics and cardiology teams to minimize the risk of exacerbating pulmonary hypertension during labor and delivery.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a severe headache, vomiting, and confusion. His past medical history is significant for a recent head injury sustained in a motor vehicle accident. On examination, his Glasgow Coma Scale score is 11/15 and he has bilateral papilloedema on fundoscopy. A non-contrast CT scan of the head shows diffuse cerebral oedema with effacement of the sulci and ventricles.
Which one of the following interventions would be most appropriate at this stage? 

A. Administration of hypertonic saline
B. Insertion of an external ventricular drain
C. Emergent craniotomy for decompressive hemicraniectomy 
D. Initiation of high-dose corticosteroids 
E. Placement of an intracranial pressure monitor

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to cerebral oedema after a traumatic brain injury. The presence of bilateral papilloedema indicates that ICP is significantly elevated, which can lead to herniation syndromes if not promptly treated. Emergent craniotomy for decompressive hemicraniectomy is indicated in patients with refractory intracranial hypertension despite maximal medical management.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset headache associated with nausea and vomiting. She reports no significant past medical history or recent trauma but mentions she has been taking oral contraceptives for several years.
On examination, her Glasgow coma scale score is 15/15 and there are no focal neurological deficits noted.
What imaging modality would be most useful in diagnosing raised intracranial pressure? 

A. Non-contrast CT scan
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
C. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound
D. Cerebral angiography
E. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with suspected raised intracranial pressure, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging modality as it can provide detailed information about the brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid spaces. MRI can also detect subtle changes in brain structure that may not be visible on computed tomography (CT). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound can be used to assess cerebral blood flow velocity but does not directly visualize the brain parenchyma.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a severe headache, vomiting, and drowsiness. His past medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he takes multiple medications.
On examination, his Glasgow coma scale score is 12/15 and there are no focal neurological deficits noted. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral papilloedema.
Which one of the following interventions would be most appropriate at this stage? 

A. Emergent craniotomy for decompressive hemicraniectomy 
B. Insertion of an external ventricular drain
C. Administration of acetazolamide
D. Initiation of high-dose corticosteroids 
E. Placement of an intracranial pressure monitor

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with raised intracranial pressure (ICP), likely due to cerebral oedema or hydrocephalus secondary to his underlying medical conditions. Bilateral papilloedema indicates significant elevation of ICP, which requires prompt intervention to prevent herniation syndromes. Placement of an intracranial pressure monitor allows continuous monitoring of ICP and guides management decisions regarding medical or surgical interventions such as administration of osmotic agents or insertion of an external ventricular drain if necessary.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to the GP with a history of recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling for the past 6 months. She reports that each episode lasts for about a week and affects different joints, including her knees, ankles, wrists, and fingers. The patient also complains of fatigue and low-grade fever during these episodes. On further questioning, she reveals that she had an episode of gastroenteritis about 2 weeks before the onset of her symptoms.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Rheumatoid arthritis
B. Systemic lupus erythematosus
C. Reactive arthritis
D. Psoriatic arthritis
E. Ankylosing spondylitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of reactive arthritis as it typically follows an infection in another part of the body (in this case gastroenteritis), involves multiple joints (oligoarthritis or polyarthritis), and is associated with extra-articular manifestations such as fever and fatigue.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents to the rheumatology clinic with a history of chronic back pain for several years which has been worsening over the past few months. He also reports intermittent episodes of joint pain and swelling affecting his knees, ankles, and feet for the past year. On examination, he has limited lumbar spine mobility with tenderness at the sacroiliac joints on palpation.

What investigations would be most useful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. HLA-B27 testing
B. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody testing
C. Synovial fluid analysis
D. MRI scan of sacroiliac joints
E. CT scan of chest

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical features are suggestive of an inflammatory arthropathy involving both peripheral joints and axial skeleton (sacroiliitis). HLA-B27 testing is useful in supporting the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, but not specific for reactive arthritis. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody testing is more commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial fluid analysis may be helpful in diagnosing septic or crystal-induced arthritis, but unlikely to be positive in reactive arthritis. CT scan of chest would not be relevant in this case.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to the GP with a history of painful and swollen left knee joint for the past week. He reports that he had unprotected sexual intercourse about 2 weeks ago and developed urethritis shortly after which was treated with antibiotics. On examination, there is evidence of effusion and tenderness on palpation over the medial aspect of the knee joint.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Septic arthritis
B. Gouty arthritis
C. Reactive arthritis
D. Rheumatoid arthritis
E. Psoriatic arthritis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of reactive arthritis as it follows an infection (urethritis) and involves a single joint (monoarthritis). Septic arthritis would typically present with more severe symptoms such as fever and systemic upset, while gouty arthritis usually affects smaller joints such as toes or fingers rather than knees. Rheumatoid and psoriatic arthropathies are chronic conditions that do not typically present acutely with monoarthritis following an infection

Question
A 45-year-old male presents with exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. On examination, he has a loud P2 heart sound and a harsh systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. An echocardiogram shows severe tricuspid regurgitation with dilated right ventricle and pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient is diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly.

Which of the following statements regarding Ebstein's anomaly is true?

A. It is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.
B. It is characterized by downward displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets into the right ventricle.
C. It commonly presents in adulthood with symptoms of right-sided heart failure.
D. Surgical intervention is not recommended for patients with mild to moderate disease.
E. Treatment options include balloon valvuloplasty or tricuspid valve replacement.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by apical displacement of the septal and posterior tricuspid valve leaflets into the right ventricle, resulting in atrialization of a portion of the right ventricle. Symptoms may present in childhood or adulthood and can range from asymptomatic to severe right-sided heart failure. Treatment options depend on symptom severity but may include medical management, balloon valvuloplasty, or surgical intervention such as tricuspid valve repair or replacement.

Question
A 50-year-old female presents with shortness of breath and palpitations on exertion for several months. She has no significant past medical history except for hypertension controlled on medications. On examination, she has elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, bilateral pitting edema up to her knees, and a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border that increases during inspiration.

An echocardiogram shows severe tricuspid regurgitation with dilated right atrium and ventricle. The patient is diagnosed with functional tricuspid regurgitation.

Which of the following statements regarding functional tricuspid regurgitation is true?

A. It is caused by primary abnormalities of the tricuspid valve leaflets.
B. It commonly presents in patients without underlying cardiac disease.
C. Treatment options include surgical repair or replacement of the tricuspid valve.
D. Medical management alone can reverse the effects of functional tricuspid regurgitation.
E. It is associated with a better prognosis than organic tricuspid regurgitation.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) is caused by secondary changes to the structure and function of the tricuspid valve due to left-sided heart disease, such as mitral stenosis or left ventricular dysfunction. FTR commonly presents in patients with underlying cardiac disease and may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms of right-sided heart failure. Treatment options depend on symptom severity but may include medical management, surgical repair or replacement of the tricuspid valve, or concomitant surgery during left-sided valvular procedures.

Question
A 60-year-old male smoker presents with dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope over several months. On examination, he has elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, bilateral pitting edema up to his thighs, and a loud P2 heart sound heard best at the second intercostal space.

An echocardiogram shows severe pulmonary hypertension with an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 90 mmHg and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.

Which of the following conditions is most likely causing this patient's pulmonary hypertension?

A. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
B. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
C. Pulmonary embolism
D. Left-sided heart failure
E. Obstructive sleep apnea

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 25 mmHg at rest. It can be caused by various conditions, including idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, left-sided heart failure, and obstructive sleep apnea. However, in this patient with severe tricuspid regurgitation and elevated right ventricular pressures, the most likely cause of his PH is chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension due to multiple episodes of pulmonary embolism. Treatment options may include anticoagulation therapy and surgical intervention such as pulmonary endarterectomy or balloon angioplasty.

Question
A 25-year-old male with sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and fever. On examination, he has a distended abdomen with tenderness on palpation. Blood tests reveal raised inflammatory markers and a low haemoglobin level. An ultrasound shows evidence of cholecystitis.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Administer intravenous fluids and analgesia
B. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics
C. Arrange for urgent surgical intervention
D. Perform an exchange transfusion
E. Refer to gastroenterology for further investigation

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with acute cholecystitis, which is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to prevent complications such as gangrene or perforation of the gallbladder. Intravenous fluids and analgesia should be given as supportive measures, but definitive treatment involves surgery (option C). Antibiotics may be indicated if there are signs of infection, but they alone will not address the underlying problem. Exchange transfusion (option D) may be used in certain situations such as acute chest syndrome or stroke, but it is not indicated in this case.

Question
A 30-year-old female with sickle cell disease presents to clinic for follow-up after being diagnosed with iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions over the years.

Which of the following statements about iron overload in patients with sickle cell disease is true? 

A. Iron overload can lead to decreased risk of infections.
B. Iron deposition primarily occurs in hepatocytes.
C. Serum ferritin levels accurately reflect total body iron stores.
D. Treatment options include oral chelators only.
E. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is unnecessary.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with sickle cell disease who receive regular blood transfusions, excess iron can accumulate in various organs, including the liver, heart and endocrine glands. Iron deposition primarily occurs in reticuloendothelial cells rather than hepatocytes (option B). Serum ferritin levels are a useful marker of iron overload but may not accurately reflect total body iron stores due to confounding factors such as inflammation or infection (option C). Treatment options include both oral and intravenous chelators, which work by binding to excess iron and facilitating its excretion from the body (option D). Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended to detect early signs of liver damage.

Question
A 20-year-old male with sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his left leg that has been worsening over the past few days. On examination, there is tenderness and swelling over the left calf muscle. An ultrasound confirms a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Which of the following statements about DVTs in patients with sickle cell disease is true? 

A. The incidence of DVTs is lower compared to the general population.
B. Anticoagulation therapy should be initiated immediately.
C. Compression stockings are contraindicated in this patient population.
D. Thrombolysis should be considered first-line treatment for all cases.
E. Prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended for high-risk patients.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Patients with sickle cell disease have an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), due to a combination of factors such as endothelial dysfunction, stasis and hypercoagulability. The incidence of VTEs is higher compared to the general population (option A). Anticoagulation therapy should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis of DVT or PE unless contraindicated, as it reduces the risk of recurrence and complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome (option B). Compression stockings may be used in conjunction with anticoagulation therapy to prevent or treat post-thrombotic syndrome (option C). Thrombolysis is reserved for select cases where there is a high risk of limb loss or life-threatening PE, and carries a significant risk of bleeding (option D). Prophylactic anticoagulation may be considered in high-risk patients such as those undergoing surgery or hospitalization.

A 35-year-old man presents with a painless lump in his right testicle, which he noticed while performing a self-examination. He has no significant past medical history and denies any family history of testicular cancer. On examination, there is a unilateral, firm testicular mass that does not transilluminate. An ultrasound confirms the presence of a solid intratesticular mass measuring 3 cm in diameter. The patient undergoes an orchiectomy, and histopathological analysis reveals a mixed germ cell tumor comprising seminoma and non-seminomatous elements.

Which one of the following statements regarding this patient's prognosis is most accurate? 

A. The risk of recurrence is highest within the first year after surgery
B. The presence of both seminoma and non-seminomatous elements confers a worse prognosis than pure seminoma
C. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be offered to all patients with stage I disease
D. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) should be performed as part of initial management for all patients with stage II disease
E. Patients with metastatic disease at presentation have a better overall survival compared to those who develop metastases later

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Mixed germ cell tumors are composed of varying proportions of different types of germ cells, including embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, teratoma, and seminoma. These tumors are classified based on their predominant component; however, they are managed differently from pure seminomas or non-seminomatous germ cell tumors due to their intermediate prognosis.
The presence of both seminomatous and non-seminomatous elements confers an intermediate prognosis between pure seminomas and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of left-sided testicular pain that has been present for the past 2 weeks. He denies any history of trauma or recent infections. On examination, there is a tender swelling in the left hemiscrotum with no palpable masses. An ultrasound scan reveals an enlarged epididymis with increased vascularity and no evidence of intratesticular pathology.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Testicular torsion
B. Epididymitis
C. Varicocele
D. Hydrocele
E. Testicular cancer

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis, which can be caused by bacterial infections, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or non-infectious causes such as autoimmune disorders or medications.
It typically presents as unilateral scrotal pain and swelling, often accompanied by fever and dysuria.

Question
A 40-year-old man presents to his urologist with a right-sided testicular mass that was incidentally discovered on abdominal imaging performed for unrelated reasons. The patient reports no symptoms related to the mass and denies any family history of testicular cancer or other malignancies. On examination, there is a firm nodule measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter within the upper pole of the right testicle.

Which one of the following statements regarding this patient's management is most accurate? 

A. Radical inguinal orchiectomy should be performed immediately without further investigation
B. Serum tumor markers are not useful in differentiating between seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors
C. CT scanning of chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed prior to surgery to assess for metastatic disease
D. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) should be offered as part of initial management for all patients with stage I disease
E. Active surveillance is a reasonable option for patients with small, non-palpable testicular masses

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Testicular cancer is a rare malignancy that typically presents as a painless testicular mass. The initial evaluation of suspected testicular cancer includes scrotal ultrasound and measurement of serum tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase). CT scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed to assess for metastatic disease.
Radical inguinal orchiectomy remains the standard treatment for most cases of testicular cancer. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection may be offered as part of management in selected cases with high-risk features on imaging or pathology. Active surveillance may be considered in carefully selected patients with small, non-palpable lesions and low-risk features on imaging and tumor markers.

Question
A 14-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe left testicular pain and swelling for the past hour. He denies any history of trauma or sexual activity. On examination, there is tenderness and swelling of the left scrotum with an absent cremasteric reflex on that side. The left testis is lying horizontally and appears higher than the right one.

What are the possible complications if this condition is not treated promptly? 

A. Infertility
B. Testicular atrophy
C. Gangrene
D. All of the above
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: If testicular torsion is not diagnosed and treated within a few hours, it can lead to irreversible damage to the affected testicle, resulting in infertility, atrophy, or even gangrene.

Question
A 16-year-old boy presents to his GP with mild discomfort in his right testicle for two weeks which has now progressed to severe pain over the last few hours.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology shows cells arranged in microfollicles with nuclear grooves and intranuclear pseudoinclusions.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Non-toxic multi-nodular goitre
B. Solitary toxic nodule
C. Papillary thyroid carcinoma
D. Follicular thyroid carcinoma
E. Graves' disease

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism and can lead to the development of multiple nodules within the thyroid gland. Fine-needle aspiration cytology findings are also consistent with this diagnosis as they show characteristic features seen in benign follicular cells associated with Graves' disease.

Question
A 56-year-old male presents to his GP with a history of palpitations, weight loss and sweating. On examination, he has a smooth goitre, fine tremor and tachycardia. His thyroid function tests show low TSH levels and raised free T4 levels. He is diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease.
The patient is started on carbimazole but develops agranulocytosis after two weeks of treatment. The GP decides to switch the patient to propylthiouracil (PTU) therapy.
Which one of the following statements regarding PTU therapy is correct? 

A. PTU can cause hepatotoxicity
B. PTU should be avoided in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
C. PTU causes less bone marrow suppression than carbimazole
D. PTU is contraindicated in pregnancy
E. PTU increases the risk of thyroid storm

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Propylthiouracil (PTU) is an antithyroid drug used in the management of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goitre when surgery or radioiodine therapy are not suitable options for treatment. It works by inhibiting both thyroid hormone synthesis and peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. However, it has been associated with severe liver injury and acute liver failure, particularly in children and adolescents, leading to its withdrawal from some countries including the UK. Additionally, it carries a higher risk of causing fetal abnormalities compared to carbimazole during pregnancy and should only be used if carbimazole is not available or contraindicated.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents with symptoms suggestive of thyrotoxicosis including heat intolerance, weight loss and anxiety. Her thyroid function tests reveal low TSH levels and high free T4 levels. She is diagnosed with Graves' disease and started on carbimazole therapy.
After two weeks of treatment, the patient develops a sore throat and fever. On examination, she has tonsillar exudates and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. A rapid antigen test confirms group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis.
Which one of the following statements regarding management of thyrotoxicosis in this patient is correct? 

A. Carbimazole should be stopped immediately
B. Radioiodine therapy can be given after 6 months of resolution of GABHS infection
C. Propranolol should be discontinued due to risk of bradycardia
D. Penicillin V should not be used as it increases thyroid hormone levels
E. Surgical intervention is preferred over medical management

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis is a common bacterial infection that can cause acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis if left untreated or inadequately treated with antibiotics such as penicillin V or amoxicillin. In patients with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease who develop GABHS pharyngitis, radioiodine therapy should be postponed until at least 6 months after complete resolution of the infection to avoid exacerbation of thyroid hormone release caused by inflammation-induced iodine uptake by the thyroid gland. Carbimazole does not need to be stopped unless there are signs of agranulocytosis or other adverse effects, but propranolol may need to be adjusted based on heart rate response.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents with symptoms suggestive of thyrotoxicosis including palpitations, tremor and weight loss. His thyroid function tests reveal low TSH levels and high free T4 levels. He is diagnosed with Graves' disease and started on carbimazole therapy.
After 6 weeks of treatment, the patient reports persistent symptoms despite normalization of his thyroid function tests. A radioactive iodine uptake scan shows diffuse increased uptake throughout the thyroid gland consistent with Graves' disease.
Which one of the following statements regarding management options for this patient is correct? 

A. Surgical intervention should be considered as first-line therapy
B. Combination therapy with carbimazole and levothyroxine should be initiated
C. Radioiodine therapy can be given after 1 year of medical management
D. Beta-blockers should be discontinued prior to radioiodine therapy
E. Carbimazole dose should be increased until euthyroidism is achieved

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease who have persistent symptoms or relapse after a course of antithyroid drug therapy such as carbimazole, radioiodine therapy is an effective and safe option for definitive treatment. It involves oral administration of a single dose of radioactive iodine-131 that selectively accumulates in the thyroid gland and destroys its functional capacity over several months without affecting other organs or tissues. The timing of radioiodine therapy depends on various factors including age, comorbidities, severity of hyperthyroidism, size and activity of the goitre, presence or absence of ophthalmopathy or dermopathy, and patient preference. Generally, it can be given after at least 6 months but preferably 12 months of medical management to allow stabilization and optimization of thyroid function before ablation. Beta-blockers may need to be continued during radioiodine therapy to control symptoms such as tachycardia or tremor.

Question

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a high-grade fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. She reports using a tampon for more than eight hours during her menstrual cycle. On examination, she has diffuse erythema over her body and is hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. The patient is diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Which of the following toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus is most likely responsible for this presentation? 

A. Enterotoxin B
B. Exfoliative toxin A 
C. Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 
D. Panton-Valentine leukocidin 
E. Alpha-toxin 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: TSS is caused by the production of superantigens such as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that are commonly found on skin and mucous membranes. TSST-1 binds to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells and T-cell receptors leading to massive cytokine release causing multiorgan failure.

Question
A 30-year-old male presents with a history of fever, myalgia, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea for three days after returning from a camping trip in rural areas where he used an insect repellent containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). He develops hypotension and confusion requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Blood cultures grow gram-negative bacilli identified as Burkholderia pseudomallei sensitive to ceftazidime but resistant to other antibiotics tested including amoxicillin-clavulanate and co-trimoxazole.
Which of the following conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis? 

A. Malaria
B. Dengue fever 
C. Q fever 
D. Toxic shock syndrome 
E. Melioidosis 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with melioidosis, a bacterial infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei commonly found in soil and water in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. It can present as septicemia, pneumonia, abscesses, or skin ulcers and has a high mortality rate if not treated appropriately.

Question
A 16-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a history of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, headache, and rash for two days after using a menstrual cup during her period. She reports leaving the cup in place for more than eight hours at a time. On examination, she has diffuse erythema over her body with desquamation of palms and soles.
Which of the following is true regarding toxic shock syndrome? 

A. It is exclusively caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.
B. It requires positive blood cultures for diagnosis.
C. It can be prevented by avoiding tampon or menstrual cup use during menstruation.
D. Treatment involves surgical debridement of affected areas.
E. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is recommended in all cases.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: TSS can be caused by both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria but can also occur due to other causes such as surgery or childbirth-related infections. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria including fever, hypotension, rash involving palms and soles, mucous membrane involvement, multiorgan dysfunction without an alternative explanation along with negative blood cultures in some cases. Prevention involves good hygiene practices including frequent hand washing and avoiding prolonged use of tampons or menstrual cups during menstruation which may lead to bacterial growth conducive to TSS. Treatment involves prompt removal of the source of infection, supportive care, and antibiotics effective against the causative organism. IVIG therapy may be considered in severe cases but is not routinely recommended.

Question
A 45-year-old woman with a history of multiple transfusions due to sickle cell anaemia is admitted for acute chest syndrome. She receives crossmatched, group-matched packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and within minutes of starting the transfusion, she develops dyspnoea, hypotension and tachycardia.

A CT scan of the chest is the most appropriate diagnostic test to evaluate for the presence of cavitary lesions or other radiographic findings consistent with active TB.

Question
A 56-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of persistent cough, fatigue, and weight loss over the past six months. He has no significant medical history but reports that he works as a miner and has been exposed to silica dust for many years. Chest x-ray shows bilateral upper lobe infiltrates, and sputum culture returns positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Which of the following medications should be added to his treatment regimen? 

A. Amikacin 
B. Ciprofloxacin 
C. Linezolid 
D. Levofloxacin
E. Pyridoxine

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with active pulmonary tuberculosis likely due to occupational exposure to silica dust. The standard first-line therapy consists of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for at least six months. However, pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation should also be added to prevent peripheral neuropathy associated with isoniazid use. Second-line drugs such as amikacin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid or levofloxacin are reserved for cases where there is resistance or intolerance to first-line agents.

Question
A 62-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with chest pain that started while he was at rest and has been ongoing for the past hour. The patient describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation in his chest, which radiates down his left arm. He also reports shortness of breath and nausea. On examination, he appears diaphoretic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in multiple leads, and troponin levels are elevated.

Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin
B. Perform an urgent coronary angiogram
C. Initiate medical therapy with aspirin and unfractionated heparin
D. Transfer the patient to a tertiary care center for primary percutaneous intervention (PCI)
E. Begin fibrinolytic therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which requires immediate reperfusion therapy via either primary PCI or fibrinolysis within 12 hours of symptom onset if primary PCI is not available or feasible due to logistical reasons such as distance from a cardiac catheterization laboratory or contraindications like bleeding risk or allergy to contrast media.

Question
A 58-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of chest discomfort over the past week that have become more frequent and severe despite taking her prescribed anti-anginal medication regularly. She reports experiencing angina at rest on several occasions during this time period, which resolves after sublingual nitroglycerin administration.

On examination, she appears anxious but hemodynamically stable with no signs of heart failure or pulmonary edema. ECG shows dynamic T-wave inversion in leads V3-V6, I, II, III, aVF and ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6. Troponin levels are negative.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Stable angina
B. Unstable angina
C. Prinzmetal (variant) angina
D. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
E. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with unstable angina, which is characterized by new-onset or worsening chest pain at rest or with minimal exertion and occurs unpredictably without a clear precipitating factor, lasts longer than 20 minutes, and is not relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin administration. ECG changes may be present but troponin levels are usually negative unless there is underlying coronary artery disease or microvascular dysfunction.

Question
A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of recurrent episodes of chest discomfort that occur during physical activity such as climbing stairs or walking uphill, but resolve after rest or nitroglycerin administration within 5-10 minutes.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient has symptoms consistent with lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, which is caused by repetitive strain injury to the extensor muscles of the forearm that attach to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a complaint of severe pain and swelling in his right hand after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. On examination, there is significant soft tissue swelling over the dorsum of the hand extending up to the mid-forearm, with tenderness on palpation. The patient has limited range of motion at the wrist joint due to pain. An X-ray shows no evidence of fracture or dislocation but reveals an abnormality in the soft tissues.

Which of the following structures is most likely affected? 

A. Extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon
B. Flexor digitorum superficialis tendon
C. Radial collateral ligament
D. Triangular fibrocartilage complex
E. Ulnar collateral ligament

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests a soft tissue injury involving the dorsal aspect of the hand and forearm, which may involve any number of structures including tendons, ligaments, or muscles. However, given that there is limited range of motion at the wrist joint and an abnormality seen on X-ray without any evidence of fracture or dislocation, it is most likely that this patient has sustained an injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The TFCC is a cartilaginous structure located on the ulnar side of the wrist joint that provides stability and support for this joint.

Question
A 50-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with complaints of persistent pain and stiffness in her left shoulder for several months now following a fall from stairs while carrying groceries in her left arm. She reports difficulty reaching overhead and behind her back as well as lifting objects above shoulder level with her left arm.

A. Adhesive capsulitis
B. Biceps tendinitis
C. Glenohumeral instability
D. Rotator cuff tear
E. Subacromial bursitis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder syndrome, which is a common cause of shoulder pain and stiffness in middle-aged individuals with a history of trauma or injury to the affected limb. It is characterized by progressive loss of active and passive range of motion at the glenohumeral joint due to inflammation and fibrosis of the joint capsule and surrounding soft tissues.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to the emergency department after sustaining an injury while playing football. He reports feeling a sudden pop in his right elbow followed by severe pain and swelling over the lateral aspect of his arm.

On examination, there is significant ecchymosis (bruising) over the lateral aspect of his right upper arm along with tenderness on palpation around the elbow joint. Active extension at his right wrist joint elicits pain in his forearm muscles.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Lateral epicondylitis 
B. Medial epicondylitis 
C. Olecranon bursitis 
D. Radial head fracture 
E. Ulnar collateral ligament sprain

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests a radial head fracture, which commonly occurs due to direct trauma or fall onto an outstretched hand causing axial loading on the forearm bones leading to disruption at their articulation point at elbow joint resulting in fractures involving either radius or ulna bone or both depending upon severity and directionality of force applied during impact.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a high-grade fever, cough, and shortness of breath for the past week. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently on inhaled bronchodilators. On examination, he appears tachypneic with bilateral crackles heard on auscultation. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Chest X-ray shows patchy infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.
Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for his symptoms? 

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Mycoplasma pneumoniae
C. Chlamydophila pneumoniae
D. Legionella pneumophila
E. Haemophilus influenzae

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation of this patient suggests community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which can be caused by various pathogens including bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. In patients with COPD, Legionella pneumophila should be considered as one of the possible causative agents due to its propensity to cause severe infections in immunocompromised individuals.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of nasal congestion, sore throat and headache for the past two weeks that have not improved despite symptomatic treatment with over-the-counter medications such as decongestants and analgesics.
On further questioning, she reports having recurrent episodes of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) every few months since childhood but denies any other significant medical history or exposure to sick contacts recently.
What would be the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Prescribe antibiotics empirically 
B. Order a chest X-ray 
C. Perform nasopharyngeal swab for viral PCR testing 
D. Refer for allergy testing 
E. Recommend saline nasal irrigation 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history suggests a possible underlying immunodeficiency or allergic rhinitis, which may predispose her to recurrent URTIs. Antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of signs of bacterial infection. Chest X-ray is not necessary unless there are other concerning symptoms or risk factors for lower respiratory tract involvement. Nasopharyngeal swab can be considered if there is suspicion for viral etiology but may not change management significantly. Saline nasal irrigation can provide symptomatic relief but does not address the underlying cause.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of persistent cough and wheezing that have been present for over a month despite treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
He reports having had an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) about two months ago that resolved after a week but has since developed these new symptoms.
On examination, he appears well-nourished with normal vital signs and no obvious distress. Lung auscultation reveals expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
What would be the most appropriate next step? 

A. Order spirometry 
B. Prescribe antibiotics empirically 
C. Refer for chest CT scan 
D. Perform sputum culture 
E. Consider referral to pulmonologist 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The persistence of symptoms despite standard therapy raises concern for alternative diagnoses such as asthma exacerbation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or even lung cancer in older patients who smoke or have occupational exposures.
Spirometry can help confirm the diagnosis of asthma or COPD but may not be necessary at this stage given the clinical picture.
Antibiotics are unlikely to be helpful in this case as there is no evidence of bacterial infection.
Chest CT scan and sputum culture may be considered if there is suspicion for structural lung disease or bacterial infection respectively, but referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management is the most appropriate next step.

A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a painful rash on his left side of the chest that has been present for the past week. He reports feeling unwell and having a fever for several days prior to the onset of the rash. On examination, you note a vesicular rash in the T5 dermatome distribution.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What are the potential complications? What investigations would you perform? What treatment options are available? 

A. Herpes zoster
B. Varicella zoster virus infection
C. Smallpox 
D. Measles 
E. Rubella

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with herpes zoster (shingles), which is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus from latency in dorsal root ganglia or cranial nerve ganglia following primary infection with chickenpox. Complications include postherpetic neuralgia, ocular involvement, bacterial superinfection, and dissemination in immunocompromised patients. Investigations may include viral culture, PCR, or serology if necessary to confirm diagnosis or rule out other causes of similar presentations such as herpes simplex virus or disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection in immunocompromised individuals. Treatment options include antiviral therapy such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir within 72 hours of symptom onset to reduce severity and duration of symptoms and prevent complications.

Question
A 32-year-old woman who is 28 weeks pregnant presents to her obstetrician with concerns about exposure to chickenpox at work two days ago when caring for a child with active disease.

What measures should be taken? What are the risks associated with maternal varicella? How can these risks be mitigated? 

A. No action required
B. Administer VZIG
C. Administer varicella vaccine
D. Monitor for symptoms and initiate antiviral therapy if necessary 
E. Deliver the baby immediately

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Pregnant women who are exposed to chickenpox should be monitored closely for development of symptoms, which can range from mild to severe depending on gestational age and immune status. Maternal varicella can lead to fetal varicella syndrome, which is associated with a range of congenital abnormalities including limb hypoplasia, skin scarring, ocular defects, and neurological deficits. The risk of fetal varicella syndrome is highest when maternal infection occurs between 13-20 weeks gestation but may occur at any time during pregnancy. Antenatal management includes monitoring for symptoms, initiating antiviral therapy such as acyclovir or valacyclovir if necessary, and close follow-up with obstetrician and neonatologist.

Question
A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of pain in his right eye that has been present for several days along with blurred vision and photophobia. He reports a history of shingles on the same side of his face two years ago.

A. Herpes simplex keratitis
B. Bacterial conjunctivitis
C. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
D. Varicella-zoster ophthalmicus 
E. Scleritis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), which is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve following primary infection with chickenpox or reactivation from latency in cranial nerve ganglia or dorsal root ganglia. Complications of HZO include corneal involvement, uveitis, optic neuritis, and cranial nerve palsies. Management includes antiviral therapy such as acyclovir or valacyclovir to reduce severity and duration of symptoms and prevent complications, topical steroids for inflammation, and referral to ophthalmology for further evaluation and management of ocular complications.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a history of recurrent varicose veins, despite having undergone multiple surgical interventions in the past. He reports experiencing pain and discomfort in his legs, particularly after prolonged standing or sitting. On examination, there are prominent varicosities visible on both legs, along with areas of hyperpigmentation and eczematous changes. An ultrasound scan reveals significant reflux in the saphenofemoral junction bilaterally.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which is a common cause of leg swelling, skin changes, and discomfort in patients with varicose veins. CVI occurs when the valves within the superficial or deep venous systems become incompetent, leading to reflux and pooling of blood within the affected veins.

Question
A 56-year-old man presents with acute onset pain and swelling in his left calf that began earlier today while he was at work. He denies any recent trauma or surgery but does report a history of smoking and hypertension. On examination, there is significant tenderness over the left calf along with mild erythema and warmth compared to the right side. There are no visible varicosities on either leg.

Which of the following diagnostic tests would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Duplex ultrasound 
B. Magnetic resonance imaging 
C. Computed tomography angiography 
D. Venogram 
E. D-dimer assay

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient has signs and symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent potential complications such as pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome. Duplex ultrasound is the preferred initial test for diagnosing DVT due to its high sensitivity and specificity, non-invasiveness, and availability in most clinical settings.

Question
A 26-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 33 weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. She has a history of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and was diagnosed with vasa praevia on her routine ultrasound scan at 20 weeks gestation. On examination, she is pale, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Fetal monitoring shows fetal distress. An urgent cesarean section is performed, and a live male infant weighing 2.5 kg is delivered.
Which of the following statements regarding vasa praevia is correct? 

A. Vasa praevia occurs when fetal blood vessels cross over the internal cervical os
B. Vasa praevia can be detected by transvaginal ultrasound only
C. The incidence of vasa praevia is higher in pregnancies conceived through IVF
D. Elective cesarean delivery before labor onset is recommended for all cases of vasa praevia 
E. Vaginal delivery can be considered if there are no signs of fetal distress

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Vasa previa occurs when fetal blood vessels cross over the internal cervical os and are at risk of rupture during labor or membrane rupture leading to catastrophic hemorrhage in the fetus due to lack of protection from placental tissue or umbilical cord compression which may lead to stillbirth or neonatal death if not recognized early enough for intervention such as an elective caesarean section before labour onset.

Question
A 32-year-old primigravida presents at 34 weeks gestation with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Her antenatal scans have shown that she has marginal placenta previa without any evidence of vasa praevia.
What should be done next? 

A. Immediate induction of labor
B. Expectant management until spontaneous labor occurs
C. Administration of antibiotics and corticosteroids, followed by induction of labor after 48 hours 
D. Immediate caesarean delivery
E. Observation only with no intervention required

Correct Answer: C 

Explanation: In cases of PPROM with marginal placenta previa without evidence of vasa praevia, the recommended management is administration of antibiotics and corticosteroids to reduce the risk of neonatal sepsis and respiratory distress syndrome respectively, followed by induction of labor after 48 hours.

Question
A 29-year-old woman presents at 30 weeks gestation with painless vaginal bleeding. She has a history of two previous cesarean deliveries for breech presentation. On examination, her cervix is closed, and there are no signs of fetal distress on monitoring.
Which one of the following statements regarding vasa praevia is true? 

A. Vasa praevia is more common in women who have had multiple vaginal deliveries
B. The diagnosis can be confirmed by transabdominal ultrasound alone 
C. Elective cesarean section should be performed if vasa praevia is suspected or diagnosed before labour onset 
D. Fetal blood sampling should be performed to confirm the diagnosis 
E. Vaginal delivery can be considered if there are no signs of fetal distress

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In cases where vasa praevia is suspected or diagnosed before labor onset, elective cesarean section should be performed to minimize the risk of catastrophic hemorrhage in the fetus due to lack of protection from placental tissue or umbilical cord compression which may lead to stillbirth or neonatal death if not recognized early enough for intervention such as an elective caesarean section before labour onset.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a complaint of recurrent episodes of fainting over the past few months. The patient reports that these episodes occur without any warning signs and are often associated with nausea, sweating, and palpitations. He also reports experiencing severe anxiety before each episode. On examination, his blood pressure is normal, but he has a slow heart rate. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals sinus bradycardia with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Vasovagal syncope
B. Cardiac arrhythmia
C. Anxiety disorder
D. Hypoglycemia 
E. Seizure disorder

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests cardiac arrhythmia as the underlying cause for his recurrent fainting episodes. Sinus bradycardia and PVCs on ECG are indicative of an abnormality in the electrical conduction system of the heart which can lead to decreased cardiac output and subsequent syncope.

Question
A 30-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of recurrent episodes of dizziness and fainting over the past few months. She reports feeling lightheaded, nauseous, and sweaty before each episode, which usually lasts for a few seconds to minutes before she regains consciousness spontaneously.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 12 weeks gestation for her booking appointment. She has a past medical history of Factor V Leiden mutation and had a previous unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left leg, which was treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Her current pregnancy is complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum, for which she has been admitted twice already. She is concerned about the risk of developing another DVT during this pregnancy and asks you what measures can be taken to prevent it? What would be your advice? 

A. Advise against any prophylaxis as there is no evidence that it reduces the risk of recurrence
B. Start aspirin from 12 weeks until delivery
C. Start LMWH from 12 weeks until delivery
D. Start warfarin from 12 weeks until delivery
E. Refer her to haematology for further management

Correct Answer: C

The preferred agent is LMWH due to its lower incidence of bleeding complications compared with unfractionated heparin.

Question
A 34-year-old primigravida at 32 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain while resting on the sofa watching TV. She denies coughing, fever or recent travel history but reports having mild swelling in both legs since last week that did not improve despite rest and elevation.
On examination, she appears anxious and tachypnoeic with oxygen saturation at room air dropping down to 90%. Cardiovascular examination reveals sinus tachycardia without murmurs or gallops. Respiratory examination reveals decreased air entry bilaterally with crackles heard at the lung bases.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
B. Acute myocardial infarction
C. Pneumonia
D. Asthma exacerbation
E. Anxiety attack

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of PE in pregnancy can be non-specific and overlap with other conditions such as asthma, pneumonia or anxiety attacks. However, sudden onset dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, tachypnoea, hypoxia and bilateral basal crepitations are highly suggestive of PE in this scenario.

Question
A 26-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 2 weeks postpartum complaining of right leg swelling and tenderness that started yesterday evening while breastfeeding her newborn baby on the sofa for an extended period of time. She denies any shortness of breath or chest pain but reports feeling generally unwell and feverish since last night.
On examination, she appears uncomfortable and has a temperature of 38°C with normal blood pressure and heart rate. Cardiovascular examination reveals no murmurs or gallops. Respiratory examination is clear bilaterally without any signs of respiratory distress.
What is the most appropriate initial investigation? 

A. D-dimer test
B. Chest X-ray
C. ECG
D. Lower limb ultrasound scan 
E. Full blood count

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which is a common complication during the postpartum period due to hypercoagulability state associated with pregnancy and delivery along with immobility related to caring for a newborn baby.
The gold standard diagnostic test for DVT is compression ultrasound scan which should be performed urgently if suspected.

It can also lead to thiamine deficiency and subsequent development of Wernicke's encephalopathy if left untreated.

Question
A 2-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department with a persistent cough and difficulty breathing for the past week. The parents report that the baby has not been vaccinated yet due to personal beliefs. On examination, the infant appears lethargic and has a respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute with intercostal recession. There are no signs of cyanosis or fever. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Blood tests reveal leukocytosis with lymphocytosis. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR confirms Bordetella pertussis infection.

Which of the following is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?

A. Administer acyclovir
B. Initiate ceftriaxone therapy
C. Start benzylpenicillin treatment
D. Commence clarithromycin therapy
E. Admit to ICU for mechanical ventilation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Infants under 6 months old are at high risk for severe complications from whooping cough, including apnea, seizures, encephalopathy, and death. Hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU) is recommended for infants with suspected or confirmed pertussis who have significant respiratory distress or apnea.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of a persistent cough that has lasted more than three weeks despite taking over-the-counter medications such as cough suppressants and expectorants without improvement in symptoms. She reports having had a mild upper respiratory tract infection about four weeks ago but did not seek medical attention at that time since she thought it was just a common cold.

On examination, there are no abnormal findings except for occasional inspiratory whoops during coughing episodes.
 
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Whooping cough
B. Bronchitis 
C. Asthma exacerbation 
D. Tuberculosis 
E. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The classic symptoms of whooping cough include a paroxysmal cough with inspiratory whoops, post-tussive vomiting, and apnea in infants. Adults may present with milder symptoms that mimic other respiratory infections such as bronchitis or asthma.

Question
A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents due to severe coughing fits for the past two weeks. He has been vaccinated against pertussis but his parents report that he was exposed to an unvaccinated child at school who had a confirmed case of whooping cough.

On examination, the patient appears well-nourished and hydrated with no signs of distress or cyanosis. There are occasional inspiratory whoops during coughing episodes and mild subcostal retractions.
 
What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient? 

A. Administer acyclovir
B. Initiate ceftriaxone therapy
C. Start benzylpenicillin treatment
D. Commence clarithromycin therapy
E. Observe and monitor at home

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Although vaccination provides protection against pertussis, breakthrough infections can occur especially when there is exposure to an infected individual in close contact settings such as schools or households. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin is recommended for patients with suspected or confirmed pertussis regardless of their vaccination status to reduce transmission and severity of illness.

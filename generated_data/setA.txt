Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset of joint pain and swelling in her left knee. She reports no history of trauma or recent illness, but does mention a family history of rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, there is significant effusion of the left knee joint with tenderness on palpation and limited range of motion. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated inflammatory markers and negative cultures from synovial fluid analysis.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Septic arthritis
B. Gout
C. Psoriatic arthritis
D. Rheumatoid arthritis
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with rheumatoid arthritis, which commonly presents with acute onset of joint pain and swelling, particularly affecting small joints such as those in the hands and feet. However, larger joints such as the knee can also be involved. Family history is a known risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis, and laboratory findings support an inflammatory process rather than infection or crystal-induced arthropathy.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents to his GP with recurrent episodes of acute joint pain and swelling over several months, affecting different joints each time including wrists, knees, ankles and shoulders. He reports feeling generally unwell during these episodes with fatigue and low-grade fever that resolves spontaneously after a few days without treatment.

On examination today he has mild effusions in both knees with tenderness on palpation but no warmth or redness noted over any affected joints at this time.

Which investigation would be most useful in establishing a diagnosis?

A. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies
B. HLA-B27 typing
C. Joint aspiration for synovial fluid analysis
D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of affected joints
E. X-ray imaging of affected joints

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's history and clinical presentation are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis, which is commonly associated with the presence of anti-CCP antibodies. This test has high specificity for rheumatoid arthritis and can help differentiate it from other forms of inflammatory arthritis such as psoriatic arthritis or reactive arthritis. HLA-B27 typing may be useful in diagnosing certain types of spondyloarthropathies but is less specific than anti-CCP antibodies for rheumatoid arthritis.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents to her GP with acute onset of joint pain and swelling in her right hand, specifically affecting the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. She reports no recent illness or trauma but does have a history of osteoarthritis affecting multiple joints including both hands.

On examination, there is significant effusion and tenderness over the affected joints with limited range of motion. Laboratory investigations reveal normal inflammatory markers and negative cultures from synovial fluid analysis.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Crystal-induced arthropathy
B. Infectious arthritis
C. Osteoarthritis flare-up
D. Rheumatoid arthritis
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with crystal-induced arthropathy, specifically gout or pseudogout which commonly affects small joints such as those in the hands and feet. Normal inflammatory markers suggest an absence of systemic inflammation, while negative cultures rule out infectious causes. The patient's history of osteoarthritis increases her risk for developing crystal-induced arthropathy due to joint damage that can lead to deposition of urate crystals (in gout) or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals (in pseudogout).

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath, chest pain, and swelling in his legs. He is found to have acute kidney injury (AKI) with a serum creatinine level of 300 µmol/L and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 mL/min/1.72m². The patient's medical history includes recent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for chronic back pain.

Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s AKI? 

A. Acute interstitial nephritis
B. Obstructive uropathy
C. Renal artery stenosis 
D. Glomerulonephritis 
E. Acute tubular necrosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient has risk factors for NSAID-induced acute interstitial nephritis, including age over 65 years, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. NSAIDs can cause renal vasoconstriction by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, leading to decreased renal blood flow and ischemia, which can result in acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis.

Question
An 80-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure presents to the hospital with worsening dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema that has been gradually increasing over several weeks despite diuretic therapy. Her laboratory tests reveal an elevated serum creatinine level at 250 µmol/L from her baseline value of 90 µmol/L three months ago.

Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Initiate intravenous furosemide
B. Administer oral sodium bicarbonate
C. Perform a renal biopsy
D. Discontinue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy
E. Initiate continuous renal replacement therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history of congestive heart failure and elevated serum creatinine level suggest that she may have developed cardiorenal syndrome, which is characterized by worsening renal function in the setting of heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can exacerbate kidney injury in patients with cardiorenal syndrome by decreasing glomerular filtration rate through their effect on the renin-angiotensin system. Discontinuing ACEI therapy may improve renal function.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain for two days. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus and takes lisinopril and metformin daily. Physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. Laboratory tests reveal an elevated serum creatinine level at 350 µmol/L from his baseline value of 90 µmol/L three months ago.

Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s AKI? 

A. Acute interstitial nephritis 
B. Obstructive uropathy 
C. Renal artery stenosis 
D. Glomerulonephritis 
E. Acute tubular necrosis 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which can be caused by ischemia or nephrotoxic agents such as medications like lisinopril or contrast media used during imaging studies in patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD). ATN typically presents with oliguria, azotemia, and electrolyte disturbances, including hyperkalemia due to impaired potassium excretion by damaged tubules.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a rash that has developed over the past few hours. She reports feeling unwell for the past week, with symptoms of fatigue and malaise. On examination, she has a widespread erythematous maculopapular rash on her trunk and limbs, which is non-blanching and tender to touch. There are also small vesicles present on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet.

Given this presentation, what is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Stevens-Johnson syndrome
B. Toxic epidermal necrolysis 
C. Erythema multiforme 
D. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 
E. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), a rare but life-threatening skin condition often caused by medication reactions or infections. TEN typically presents as an acute onset of fever, malaise, and mucocutaneous blistering or detachment affecting more than 30% of total body surface area (TBSA).

Question
A 60-year-old male presents to his GP clinic with a new-onset rash on his chest and back that has been present for several weeks. He reports feeling generally unwell during this time, with fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats.

On examination there are multiple reddish-brown maculopapular lesions scattered across the patient's trunk and upper extremities.

Given this presentation, what is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) 
B. Lichen planus 
C. Pityriasis rosea
D. Secondary syphilis
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is concerning for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the skin but can also involve other organs such as blood, lymph nodes etc.. CTCL typically presents as persistent itchy patches or plaques on sun-protected areas of the body like trunk, buttocks etc., which may progress over months to years into tumors or ulcers if left untreated. Constitutional symptoms like fever, night sweats etc may be seen in advanced stages of disease along with systemic involvement in some cases

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to the GP with complaints of anxiety, insomnia and restlessness.

Which of the following medications is most appropriate for managing this patient's opioid addiction?

A. Naltrexone
B. Methadone
C. Buprenorphine
D. Disulfiram
E. Acamprosate

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor that can be used in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid addiction. It helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms without producing the same level of euphoria as full agonists like heroin or oxycodone, making it less likely to be abused or diverted.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of chronic pain in her lower back and knees due to osteoarthritis. She has been taking prescribed codeine tablets for over a year now, but she feels that they are no longer effective in relieving her pain. She requests an increase in dosage or a stronger medication.
What should be the next step in managing this patient's pain? 

A. Increase dose of codeine 
B. Prescribe tramadol 
C. Refer for physiotherapy 
D. Switch to non-opioid analgesics 
E. Prescribe fentanyl patches

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Long-term use of opioids such as codeine can lead to tolerance, dependence, and increased risk of adverse effects such as constipation, nausea, sedation, respiratory depression, and overdose death. In cases where the patient's pain is not well-controlled with opioids, it may be necessary to switch to non-opioid analgesics such as paracetamol or NSAIDs, or consider other non-pharmacological interventions like physiotherapy.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department after being found unconscious in a public restroom. He has a history of alcohol and drug abuse and was recently discharged from rehab for treatment of opioid addiction. His friends report that he had been using heroin again and drinking heavily before losing consciousness.
Which of the following medications should be administered first in managing this patient? 

A. Naloxone
B. Flumazenil
C. Diazepam
D. Haloperidol
E. Lorazepam

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can rapidly reverse respiratory depression and other life-threatening effects of opioid overdose by competing with opioids for binding at mu-opioid receptors in the brainstem and reversing their effects on respiration and consciousness. It should be administered as soon as possible in suspected cases of opioid overdose, even before confirmation by laboratory tests or imaging studies.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her General Practitioner with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema for the past year. She has no known allergies, but she reports that her symptoms are particularly severe during times of stress. She denies any recent infections or medication changes. On examination, there are no abnormal findings except for some mild swelling around her lips.

Which of the following is most likely to be the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms? 

A. Mastocytosis 
B. Chronic idiopathic urticaria
C. Hereditary angioedema 
D. Autoimmune urticaria 
E. Drug-induced urticaria

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with autoimmune urticaria, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of hives and/or angioedema without an identifiable trigger or underlying disease process. Stress can exacerbate these symptoms in some patients. Mastocytosis would present with more systemic symptoms such as flushing, abdominal pain, and diarrhea along with skin manifestations like hives and itching; chronic idiopathic urticaria would not have a clear trigger like stress; hereditary angioedema typically presents earlier in life than age 25; drug-induced urticaria would require a recent medication change.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to his allergist with complaints of persistent nasal congestion, postnasal drip, and coughing for several months despite treatment with intranasal corticosteroids and antihistamines. He also reports occasional wheezing and shortness of breath on exertion but denies any chest pain or palpitations. His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia treated with medications.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Refer for allergy testing 
B. Prescribe leukotriene receptor antagonists 
C. Initiate oral corticosteroids 
D. Order pulmonary function tests 
E. Perform a CT scan of the chest

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's symptoms are suggestive of asthma, and pulmonary function tests would be the most appropriate next step to confirm this diagnosis. Allergy testing may be useful in identifying potential triggers for his symptoms but would not change management at this point; leukotriene receptor antagonists can be used as adjunctive therapy for asthma but should not replace inhaled corticosteroids as first-line treatment; oral corticosteroids have significant side effects and should only be used short-term for acute exacerbations; a CT scan of the chest is not indicated unless there is concern for other underlying lung pathology.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to her General Practitioner with complaints of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and nausea after consuming dairy products. She reports that these symptoms have been present since childhood but have become more frequent over the past year. On examination, there are no abnormal findings except for some mild tenderness on palpation of the abdomen.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Lactose intolerance 
B. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 
C. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
D. Celiac disease 
E. Food allergy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with lactose intolerance, which is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms after consumption of milk or dairy products due to an inability to digest lactose properly. IBS typically presents with similar symptoms but without a clear dietary trigger; IBD would require further investigation such as colonoscopy and biopsy; celiac disease would also require specific testing such as serology and small bowel biopsy; food allergies typically present with more immediate onset symptoms like hives or anaphylaxis rather than delayed gastrointestinal symptoms like in this case.

Question
A 65-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of numbness and tingling in her left arm and leg, which progressed to weakness over the past hour. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. On examination, she has reduced sensation in a stocking-glove distribution on the left side, along with decreased power in her left upper and lower limbs. Her reflexes are brisk on the right side but absent on the left. CT scan shows no evidence of hemorrhage or mass lesion.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
B. Multiple sclerosis
C. Peripheral neuropathy
D. Spinal cord compression
E. Guillain-Barre syndrome

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest an acute onset of spinal cord compression, which can cause sensory deficits as well as motor weakness and loss of reflexes below the level of compression.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents with complaints of numbness and tingling in his hands for several months that have gradually worsened over time.

There is no evidence of muscle wasting or fasciculations.

Which one of the following investigations is most likely to provide a definitive diagnosis?

A. Nerve biopsy
B. Electromyography (EMG)
C. Lumbar puncture
D. MRI scan of the brain
E. Skin biopsy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest a peripheral neuropathy, which can be confirmed by electromyography (EMG) testing that measures nerve conduction velocity and detects abnormalities in muscle activity caused by nerve damage.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a history of primary amenorrhoea and infertility. She reports normal pubertal development, but never had menstrual periods. On examination, she has normal secondary sexual characteristics, including Tanner stage V breast development and pubic hair distribution. Pelvic ultrasound reveals absent uterus and ovaries. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Turner syndrome
B. Androgen insensitivity syndrome
C. Mullerian agenesis
D. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
E. Kallmann syndrome

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with Mullerian agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by congenital absence of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina in an otherwise phenotypically normal female.

Question
A 24-year-old woman presents with secondary amenorrhoea for six months after previously having regular menstrual cycles every 28 days since menarche at age 12 years old. She denies any recent weight changes or excessive exercise habits but admits to occasional binge eating episodes followed by self-induced vomiting for several years prior to her current presentation. Her BMI is within normal range at 22 kg/m² on physical examination, and there are no signs of hirsutism or acne.
Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
B. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH)
C. Thyroid function tests
D. Prolactin level
E. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical features suggest functional hypothalamic amenorrhea due to disordered eating behaviors that may lead to elevated prolactin levels. Prolactin inhibits the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, which in turn suppresses the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland.

Question
A 16-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhoea and delayed puberty. She has a history of recurrent respiratory infections and chronic diarrhea since childhood. On examination, she appears younger than her stated age with no breast development or pubic hair growth.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Serum FSH
B. Serum LH
C. Thyroid function tests
D. Karyotype analysis
E. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's clinical features suggest celiac disease as an underlying cause of delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea due to malabsorption of nutrients essential for normal growth and development during adolescence. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies can confirm the diagnosis by detecting gluten sensitivity in affected individuals even if they do not have overt gastrointestinal symptoms.

Question
A 32-year-old woman with a history of severe allergic reactions presents to the emergency department after being stung by a bee while gardening. She develops facial swelling, difficulty breathing, and chest tightness within minutes of the sting. On examination, she has diffuse urticaria and wheezing on auscultation. Anaphylaxis is suspected.
What is the recommended dose of intramuscular adrenaline for this patient? What are the potential adverse effects?

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing the diagnosis? 

A. Echocardiography 
B. CT angiogram 
C. Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
D. Serum electrolytes 
E. Carotid Doppler ultrasound

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest cardiogenic syncope, which can be caused by various cardiac abnormalities such as arrhythmias, structural heart disease, or myocardial infarction. An ECG is a simple and non-invasive investigation that can provide valuable information on the underlying cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities in patients with syncope.

Question
A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, presents to the emergency department at 34 weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. She reports that she has had intermittent spotting throughout her pregnancy but this episode is more severe than previous ones. On examination, her vital signs are stable, and a handheld doppler reveals a normal foetal heart rate. However, on speculum examination, there is active bleeding from the cervix and an ultrasound shows a low-lying placenta with evidence of retroplacental haemorrhage.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Admit for IV corticosteroids and monitoring
B. Admit for tocolysis and monitoring
C. Admit for category 1 caesarean section
D. Discharge with planned induction at 37-38 weeks
E. Perform cervical cerclage

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presence of active vaginal bleeding in combination with abdominal pain suggests significant antepartum haemorrhage which can be life-threatening to both mother and baby if not managed promptly. In addition, the ultrasound findings suggest that there may be a risk of further bleeding or placental abruption which could lead to fetal distress or demise. Therefore, immediate delivery by category 1 caesarean section is indicated.

Question
A 35-year-old primigravida at 30 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with sudden onset vaginal bleeding after experiencing a fall down stairs earlier in the day. She denies any associated pain or contractions but reports feeling light-headed since the incident occurred.

On examination, her vital signs are within normal limits except for tachycardia (HR=110 bpm). Abdominal palpation reveals mild tenderness over the uterus without any obvious contractions noted on CTG monitoring.

An ultrasound scan confirms no evidence of placenta praevia but there is a large retroplacental haemorrhage.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Admit for IV corticosteroids and monitoring
B. Admit for tocolysis and monitoring
C. Admit for category 1 caesarean section
D. Discharge with planned induction at 37-38 weeks
E. Administer tranexamic acid

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of tachycardia in combination with vaginal bleeding suggests significant antepartum haemorrhage which can be life-threatening to both mother and baby if not managed promptly. In addition, the ultrasound findings suggest that there may be a risk of further bleeding or placental abruption which could lead to fetal distress or demise. Therefore, admission for IV corticosteroids and monitoring is indicated to allow time for foetal lung maturity before delivery.

Question
A 26-year-old woman presents at 36 weeks gestation with painless vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse earlier in the day. She has had an uncomplicated pregnancy so far and denies any other symptoms such as contractions or abdominal pain.

On examination, her vital signs are stable, and CTG reveals a reassuring trace without any evidence of uterine activity.

An ultrasound scan confirms no evidence of placenta praevia but shows a small subchorionic haematoma measuring approximately 2cm x 3cm.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Admit for IV corticosteroids and monitoring
B. Advise bed rest until delivery 
C. Discharge home with close follow-up 
D. Perform amniocentesis 
E. Administer prophylactic antibiotics

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presence of painless vaginal bleeding in combination with a reassuring CTG suggests that the bleeding is unlikely to be life-threatening to either mother or baby. The ultrasound findings suggest a small subchorionic haematoma which is a common cause of antepartum bleeding and usually resolves spontaneously without any intervention. Therefore, the most appropriate management in this case would be to discharge home with close follow-up and advice regarding signs of further bleeding or preterm labour.

Question
An elderly male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the emergency department after experiencing sudden-onset dyspnea and chest pain while at home alone. He is found by his neighbor who calls an ambulance immediately upon discovering him unresponsive on the floor.

Upon arrival at the hospital, he is intubated due to respiratory distress and placed on mechanical ventilation support. However, shortly thereafter, he goes into cardiac arrest with no detectable pulse or blood pressure despite ongoing resuscitative efforts.

What would be the most appropriate action for managing this patient's cardiorespiratory arrest? 

A. Administer epinephrine intravenously every 3-5 minutes during CPR 
B. Initiate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy 
C. Consider performing therapeutic hypothermia 
D. Administer sodium bicarbonate intravenously 
E. Perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to assess for cardiac tamponade

Correct Answer: B 

Explanation: In cases of refractory cardiorespiratory arrest, ECMO therapy can be initiated as a bridge to recovery or transplantation. This involves the use of an external circuit that oxygenates and circulates blood outside the body, allowing time for the heart and lungs to recover.

Question
A 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents to the emergency department after experiencing sudden-onset chest pain while at work. Upon arrival, he is found to be in cardiac arrest with no detectable pulse or blood pressure despite ongoing resuscitative efforts.

What would be the most appropriate action for managing this patient's cardiorespiratory arrest? 

A. Administer calcium gluconate intravenously 
B. Initiate continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) 
C. Perform peritoneal dialysis 
D. Administer insulin and dextrose intravenously 
E. Consider performing therapeutic plasma exchange 

Correct Answer: A 

Explanation: In cases of PEA associated with hyperkalemia, administering calcium gluconate intravenously can help stabilize myocardial cell membranes and improve contractility.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with a six-month history of constipation, abdominal discomfort and bloating. She has noticed a change in the frequency and consistency of her stools, which have become harder and less frequent than usual. On further questioning, she reports that she has lost weight unintentionally over the past few months. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but she takes no regular medications. Physical examination reveals an enlarged liver palpable below the costal margin.

Which one of the following is most likely?

A. Colonic carcinoma
B. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
C. Diverticular disease
D. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
E. Chronic pancreatitis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of colonic carcinoma, particularly given her age, weight loss and physical exam findings of an enlarged liver.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a three-month history of alternating diarrhea and constipation associated with cramping abdominal pain relieved by defecation. He also complains of rectal bleeding on several occasions during this period. His past medical history is unremarkable except for occasional headaches treated with paracetamol as required.
On examination, there is mild tenderness in his lower abdomen without any palpable masses or organomegaly.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A) Ulcerative colitis 
B) Crohn’s disease 
C) Irritable bowel syndrome 
D) Coeliac disease 
E) Infectious diarrhoea 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which commonly presents with alternating diarrhea and constipation along with abdominal pain relieved by defecation.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of recent onset of bloody diarrhea accompanied by fever and abdominal pain. She has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications. On examination, she appears unwell with a temperature of 38.5°C and tenderness in the left lower quadrant of her abdomen.

Which one of the following is most likely? 

A) Ulcerative colitis 
B) Crohn’s disease 
C) Infectious colitis 
D) Diverticulitis 
E) Ischemic colitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of infectious colitis, which commonly presents with bloody diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a two-day history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea. He reports that his stools have been dark green in colour for the past week. On examination, he is tachycardic and has diffuse tenderness on palpation of his abdomen. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and an INR of 2.5. Abdominal ultrasound shows dilated intrahepatic bile ducts but no gallstones or other abnormalities.

Which of the following conditions should be considered as a possible cause of this patient's symptoms? 

A. Acute pancreatitis
B. Cholecystitis 
C. Hepatitis A 
D. Primary sclerosing cholangitis 
E. Small bowel obstruction

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation is suggestive of obstructive jaundice due to biliary tract disease, which can be caused by various conditions including primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is a chronic autoimmune condition that affects the bile ducts within and outside the liver, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and strictures that can result in biliary obstruction and cirrhosis over time.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with a three-month history of intermittent diarrhoea associated with crampy abdominal pain and weight loss. She also reports noticing blood in her stool on several occasions during this period, which she describes as bright red mixed with mucus or coating the surface of the stool without changing its colour otherwise.

On examination, there are no significant findings except mild tenderness on palpation of the left lower quadrant.

What investigation would you recommend at this stage? 

A. Barium enema
B. Colonoscopy
C. Faecal calprotectin
D. Stool culture
E. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The symptoms and signs are suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which can be confirmed by colonoscopy with biopsy. Barium enema is less sensitive and specific than colonoscopy, and faecal calprotectin is a non-invasive test that can support the diagnosis but not replace endoscopic evaluation. Stool culture may be indicated if there is suspicion of infectious diarrhoea, but this seems unlikely in this case. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy would not provide useful information about the lower GI tract.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his GP with a one-week history of loose stools that have changed from brown to yellowish-green in colour. He denies any abdominal pain or other symptoms, and reports no recent travel or dietary changes.

On examination, he appears well and hydrated, with normal vital signs and no focal findings on abdominal palpation.

What investigation would you consider at this stage? 

A. Abdominal CT scan
B. Faecal elastase testing
C. Fasting serum bile acid measurement
D. Small bowel capsule endoscopy
E. Stool microscopy for ova and parasites

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The change in stool colour suggests malabsorption of fat-soluble pigments such as bilirubin, which can occur due to various causes including pancreatic insufficiency. Faecal elastase testing is a simple and reliable way to assess exocrine pancreatic function, which can help identify or exclude this condition without exposing the patient to unnecessary radiation or invasive procedures. Abdominal CT scan may be indicated if there are other concerning features such as weight loss or obstructive symptoms, but it has low sensitivity for mild pancreatic dysfunction. Fasting serum bile acid measurement is more relevant for liver diseases than pancreatic disorders. Small bowel capsule endoscopy may be considered if there is suspicion of small bowel pathology such as Crohn's disease, but this seems less likely in the absence of other symptoms. Stool microscopy for ova and parasites may be useful if there is suspicion of infectious diarrhoea, but this seems unlikely in this case.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain that radiates to his back and jaw. He describes it as a tearing sensation, which started while he was lifting weights at the gym. On examination, his blood pressure is 180/100mmHg in both arms, and there is a difference of 20mmHg between his right and left brachial pulses. His heart rate is regular at 90 bpm, and respiratory rate is normal. An ECG shows ST-segment depression in leads V1-V6, I, II, III and AVF.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute coronary syndrome
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Aortic dissection
D. Pericarditis
E. Gastroesophageal reflux disease

The pain lasts for a few seconds to minutes and then resolves spontaneously.

On examination, he appears well with no signs of distress or shortness of breath. His vital signs are within normal limits, and cardiovascular exam reveals no murmurs or gallops.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Angina pectoris 
B. Myocardial infarction 
C. Pericarditis 
D. Costochondritis 
E. Pulmonary embolism

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest costochondritis which can be confirmed by performing a physical exam and ruling out other causes of chest pain such as cardiac or pulmonary etiologies.

Question
A 3-year-old child is brought to the emergency department by his mother with a history of vomiting and lethargy for the past few days. On examination, you notice bruises on the child's face and body in various stages of healing. The mother explains that the child fell down the stairs a few days ago, which caused these injuries. However, you are suspicious of non-accidental injury (NAI) as an explanation for these injuries.

Which of the following features would support your suspicion? 

A. Bruises on bony prominences
B. Bruises on soft tissue areas
C. Multiple bruises in different stages of healing
D. All of the above
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Bruising on bony prominences or soft tissue areas can be indicative of NAI if it does not fit with an accidental cause such as falling down stairs or playing sports. Multiple bruises in different stages of healing may also suggest ongoing abuse rather than a one-off accident.

Question
A 6-year-old boy is brought to your clinic by his father who reports that he has been wetting himself during the day and having nightmares at night for several weeks now.

What is your next step? 

A. Refer him to a psychologist for therapy 
B. Prescribe medication for anxiety 
C. Arrange social services intervention 
D. Order imaging studies to rule out any physical causes 
E. Reassure him and advise follow-up if symptoms persist

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In this scenario, it is important to acknowledge that these symptoms could be related to stressors associated with parental separation/divorce but also consider other possible medical conditions that could present similarly such as urinary tract infections or diabetes insipidus before referring the child to a psychologist or social services. 

Question
A 10-year-old girl is brought in by her mother who reports that she has been experiencing abdominal pain and constipation for several months now. On examination, you notice that she has developed pubic hair and breast buds despite not yet reaching puberty.

Which of the following conditions should be considered? 

A. Precocious puberty 
B. Hypothyroidism
C. Cushing's syndrome 
D. Turner's syndrome 
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Precocious puberty can be caused by various factors including hormonal imbalances due to tumours, infections, or exposure to exogenous hormones such as those found in some medications or environmental toxins. However, it is important to consider other possible causes such as hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, or Turner's syndrome before making a diagnosis of precocious puberty. Additionally, sexual abuse should also be considered as a potential cause of early onset puberty in girls.

Symptoms include an enlarged head circumference, bulging fontanelles, irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, developmental delays or regression, and abnormal muscle tone or reflexes. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of hydrocephalus and may involve surgical interventions such as shunt placement or endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV).

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of bluish discoloration of her fingers and toes, along with severe pain and numbness in those areas. She has a history of Raynaud's phenomenon but denies any recent triggers or exposure to cold temperatures. On examination, there is no evidence of peripheral arterial disease or thromboembolic events. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-Smith antibodies.
What is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms? 

A. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
B. Scleroderma
C. Rheumatoid arthritis
D. Mixed connective tissue disorder
E. Antiphospholipid syndrome

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with scleroderma, which can cause Raynaud's phenomenon as well as digital ischemia due to vasculopathy affecting small blood vessels in the fingers and toes. Elevated ANA and anti-Smith antibodies are seen in patients with SLE but do not necessarily indicate active disease or specific organ involvement.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of shortness of breath on exertion for several months, along with occasional chest pain and fatigue. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking cigarettes for over 30 years.

Defecating proctography is considered the gold standard investigation for assessing anorectal function and identifying structural abnormalities such as rectal prolapse or intussusception.

Question
A 72-year-old man presents with a history of chronic constipation and recent onset of faecal incontinence over the past month. He reports having hard stools that are difficult to pass, straining during defecation, and feeling incomplete evacuation after bowel movements. He also experiences episodes of diarrhoea alternating with constipation.

On examination, there is evidence of mild rectal prolapse on straining, but no other significant findings.

What is the most likely cause of his symptoms? 

A. Chronic idiopathic constipation 
B. Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation 
C. Pelvic floor dyssynergia 
D. Rectal cancer 
E. Ulcerative colitis 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest pelvic floor dysfunction, specifically pelvic floor dyssynergia where there is paradoxical contraction rather than relaxation during attempted defecation. This can lead to incomplete evacuation, straining and constipation as well as faecal incontinence.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent episodes of faecal incontinence over the past year. She describes leakage of liquid stool without warning, which occurs several times per day and is associated with urgency. On examination, there are no signs of rectal prolapse or haemorrhoids. Anorectal manometry reveals normal resting anal pressure but decreased squeeze pressure.

Which of the following treatments would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Biofeedback therapy 
B. Bowel retraining 
C. Colostomy formation 
D. Sacral nerve stimulation 
E. Transanal irrigation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest urge faecal incontinence due to impaired rectal sensation or neuromuscular dysfunction, which may respond to sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). SNS involves implanting an electrode near the sacral nerves that control bowel function, which can improve continence by modulating these nerves' activity and improving coordination between the pelvic floor muscles and anal sphincter.

Question
A 75-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after a fall at home. She has a history of osteoporosis and takes calcium and vitamin D supplements regularly.

What is the most likely cause of his falls? 

A. Peripheral neuropathy
B. Orthostatic hypotension
C. Cerebellar ataxia
D. Vestibular dysfunction
E. Myopathy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Orthostatic hypotension can cause dizziness upon standing up from sitting or lying down positions leading to falls especially in elderly individuals taking medications that affect blood pressure regulation like antihypertensives or levodopa-carbidopa used in Parkinson's disease.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with chronic back pain following a fall while working on a construction site. He reports landing on his feet and then falling backward, hitting his back against a metal beam. On examination, he has tenderness over the lower thoracic spine with no neurological deficits.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Compression fracture
B. Spondylolisthesis
C. Herniated disc
D. Spinal stenosis
E. Osteoarthritis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The mechanism of injury and location of tenderness suggest a compression fracture which is common in elderly individuals with osteoporosis or younger individuals involved in high-energy trauma leading to axial loading forces on the spine causing vertebral body collapse and subsequent pain.

Question
A couple presents to their General Practitioner with concerns about the possibility of passing on a genetic disorder to their future children. The husband's family has a history of Huntington's disease, while the wife's family has a history of cystic fibrosis.

Question
You are a GP and have been asked to issue a fit note for a patient who has been off work due to stress. The patient is requesting that you indicate on the fit note that they need to be off work for at least 3 months, as they feel this will give them enough time to recover fully. However, you believe that it would be more appropriate for the patient to return to work sooner than this. What should you do? Provide reasons for your answer.

A. Issue the fit note with the requested duration as it is ultimately up to the patient
B. Refuse to issue a fit note altogether since you disagree with the requested duration
C. Discuss your concerns with the patient and negotiate an appropriate duration together
D. Refer the patient to occupational health services for further assessment
E. Seek advice from a senior colleague before issuing the fit note

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: As a GP, it is important to consider both the needs of the patient and their employer when issuing a fit note. While it may be tempting to simply comply with the patient's request, it is important to ensure that they are not unnecessarily absent from work for longer than necessary, which can have negative consequences for their mental health and financial situation. Refusing to issue a fit note altogether is also not appropriate as it does not address the underlying issues causing the patient's stress. Instead, discussing your concerns with the patient and negotiating an appropriate duration together allows for shared decision-making and ensures that both parties' needs are considered.

Question
You are working in an occupational health clinic and have been asked by an employer to assess an employee who has been off sick due to back pain for several weeks. The employee has provided a self-certification form but no other medical evidence so far. During your assessment, you find that while there is some discomfort present, there are no significant physical findings or limitations preventing them from returning to work. However, the employee insists that they are unable to return to work due to ongoing pain. What should you do? Provide reasons for your answer.

A. Issue a fit note indicating that the employee is not fit for work
B. Advise the employer that the employee is fit for work and recommend a phased return
C. Refer the employee for further medical assessment or treatment
D. Request additional medical evidence from the employee's GP before making a decision
E. Advise the employer to terminate the employee's contract due to prolonged absence

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: As an occupational health professional, it is important to balance both the needs of the employer and those of the employee when assessing fitness for work. In this case, while there may be some discomfort present, there are no significant physical findings or limitations preventing them from returning to work. Issuing a fit note indicating that they are not fit for work would therefore be inappropriate and potentially harmful to their recovery by reinforcing beliefs about disability and sickness absence as well as creating financial difficulties if statutory sick pay has run out.
Referring them back to their GP without any clear indication of what else can be done will only prolong their absence and delay their return-to-work process which could lead into long-term sickness absence.
Requesting additional medical evidence from the patient's GP might also cause delays in getting back into employment.
Instead, advising the employer that they are fit for work and recommending a phased return allows for a safe and supported transition back into work while also addressing any concerns or accommodations needed.

Question
You have been asked by an employer to assess an employee who has been off sick with depression for several months. The employee has provided a fit note from their GP stating that they are unfit for work but does not want any contact with their employer during this time. The employer is concerned about how long this situation will continue and wants more information about when the employee is likely to return to work. What should you do? Provide reasons for your answer.

A. Contact the employee's GP directly to discuss their condition and expected recovery time
B. Advise the employer that they cannot have any information about the employee's medical condition without their consent
C. Arrange a meeting with both the employer and employee to discuss their situation together
D. Issue a fit note indicating when the employee is likely to be able to return to work
E. Refer the employee for further psychiatric assessment or treatment

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: As an occupational health professional, it is important to respect patient confidentiality while also providing appropriate support and advice to employers. In this case, since the employee has explicitly stated that they do not want any contact with their employer during this time, it would be inappropriate to disclose any information about their medical condition without their explicit consent.
Arranging a meeting between all parties might cause more anxiety and stress on the part of the employee who may feel pressured into returning back earlier than necessary.
Instead, advising the employer that they cannot have any information about the employee's medical condition without their consent allows for transparency and clarity in communication while also respecting patient autonomy and privacy.

Question
A 25-year-old female with a history of epilepsy presents to the emergency department after having a seizure that lasted for over 10 minutes.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of sudden jerking movements in his right arm while he was gardening earlier today. He reports no loss of consciousness or confusion during the episode but felt tired afterward and slept for several hours.
On further questioning, he reveals that he had similar episodes two years ago that were initially diagnosed as focal aware seizures but later re-evaluated as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). His medical history includes depression and anxiety disorder for which he takes sertraline.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Refer him to an epilepsy specialist for further evaluation
B. Increase the dose of sertraline 
C. Order an EEG to confirm PNES diagnosis 
D. Prescribe lorazepam PRN for future events 
E. Start levetiracetam as prophylaxis against future events

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Given the patient's previous history of PNES, it would be important to rule out any underlying neurological causes before making any changes to his current treatment regimen. Referral to an epilepsy specialist would be the most appropriate next step.

Question
A 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presents to the emergency department after being found unresponsive at home by his family.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of recurrent abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea for the past 6 months. She reports that she has tried various diets but none have provided any relief. On further questioning, she reveals that her symptoms worsen after consuming certain foods such as wheat, dairy and eggs. The GP suspects food intolerance and recommends an elimination diet followed by reintroduction to identify the offending food(s). Which of the following is NOT a recommended approach in identifying food intolerances? 

A. Elimination diet
B. Skin prick testing
C. IgE blood tests
D. Food challenge test 
E. FODMAPs diet

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: While the FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet can be helpful for those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it is not typically used to diagnose specific food intolerances. An elimination diet involves removing suspected trigger foods from the diet for several weeks before gradually reintroducing them one at a time while monitoring symptoms. Skin prick testing and IgE blood tests are used to diagnose allergies rather than intolerances, while a food challenge test involves supervised consumption of small amounts of suspected trigger foods under medical supervision.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to his GP with recurrent episodes of hives over the past few months which he attributes to stress at work. He denies any other symptoms or recent changes in his diet or medication use. Physical examination is unremarkable except for multiple raised red welts on his arms and legs consistent with urticaria/hives.
Which of the following is NOT considered a common cause of chronic urticaria? 

A. Food allergy/intolerance
B. Autoimmune disorders
C. Infections 
D. Medications 
E. Stress

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: While stress can exacerbate chronic urticaria, it is not considered a common cause. Food allergy/intolerance, autoimmune disorders, infections and medications are all potential triggers for chronic urticaria.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of recurrent abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea after consuming dairy products. She reports that she has tried lactase supplements but they have not provided any relief. The GP suspects lactose intolerance and recommends further testing. Which of the following tests is NOT used to diagnose lactose intolerance? 

A. Lactose tolerance test
B. Hydrogen breath test 
C. Stool acidity test 
D. Genetic testing 
E. IgE blood test 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: An IgE blood test is used to diagnose allergies rather than intolerances such as lactose intolerance which occurs due to deficiency in the enzyme lactase needed to break down lactose (milk sugar). Lactose tolerance test involves drinking a liquid containing high levels of lactose followed by measuring glucose levels over time while hydrogen breath test measures the amount of hydrogen in exhaled air after drinking a liquid containing lactose. Stool acidity test measures the amount of lactic acid produced when undigested lactose ferments in the colon while genetic testing can identify mutations associated with primary or congenital forms of lactase deficiency.

Question

B. Refer to neurosurgery for surgical resection
C. Prescribe analgesics for headache relief
D. Order serum tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin)
E. No further action needed

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Pineal gland cysts are common incidental findings on MRI scans and are usually benign and asymptomatic, requiring no treatment or follow-up unless they cause symptoms or grow in size over time.

Question
A 6-month-old baby is brought to the GP by her mother with a history of recurrent vomiting and poor feeding for the past month. The baby was born at term via normal vaginal delivery and had no complications during birth or in the neonatal period. She was exclusively breastfed until 4 months of age when her mother introduced formula milk due to work commitments. Since then, she has been having frequent episodes of vomiting after feeds, which are not projectile but often result in significant distress.

On examination, the baby appears well-nourished and hydrated with no signs of dehydration or weight loss. There is no abdominal distension or tenderness on palpation, and bowel sounds are present. However, there is evidence of mild gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) on clinical examination.

What would be the most appropriate management plan for this infant? 

A. Start proton pump inhibitor therapy
B. Refer for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
C. Trial thickened feed
D. Switch to amino acid-based formula
E. Advise continuing current management

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are effective in reducing gastric acid secretion and can be used as first-line treatment for GERD in infants who have failed conservative measures such as positioning changes and smaller feeds. Referral for endoscopy may be considered if symptoms persist despite PPI therapy or if there are other concerning features such as iron-deficiency anemia or failure to thrive. Thickened feeds may also be trialed in some cases, but their efficacy remains controversial. Switching to amino acid-based formula should only be considered in infants with suspected cow's milk protein allergy.

Question
A 3-week-old boy is admitted to hospital with severe dehydration secondary to diarrhoea and vomiting that started 2 days ago. He was born at term via normal vaginal delivery without any complications during pregnancy or delivery. He was exclusively breastfed until 2 days ago when his mother started giving him formula milk as she had to return to work.

On examination, the baby is lethargic and dehydrated with dry mucous membranes and sunken fontanelles. There are no other significant findings on clinical examination.

What would be the most appropriate initial management for this infant? 

A. Start intravenous fluids
B. Trial oral rehydration solution (ORS)
C. Perform stool culture and sensitivity testing
D. Commence broad-spectrum antibiotics
E. Advise continuing current feeding regimen

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is the first-line treatment for dehydration in infants with acute gastroenteritis. Intravenous fluids may be required if there is severe dehydration or if ORS cannot be tolerated due to persistent vomiting or altered consciousness. Stool culture and sensitivity testing should be performed in cases of suspected bacterial or parasitic infection, but empirical antibiotic therapy is not recommended unless there are signs of systemic illness or sepsis.

Question
A 4-month-old girl presents to the GP with a history of recurrent episodes of choking and coughing during feeds that have been increasing in frequency over the past week. She was born at term via normal vaginal delivery without any complications during pregnancy or delivery. She has been exclusively breastfed until now, but her mother has recently introduced solid foods such as pureed fruits and vegetables.

On examination, the baby appears well-nourished and hydrated with no signs of respiratory distress or cyanosis at rest. However, there is evidence of mild stridor on inspiration during feeding.

What would be the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Refer for urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
B. Stop all solid foods immediately
C. Trial thickened feed
D. Commence proton pump inhibitor therapy
E. Advise continuing current feeding regimen

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Recurrent episodes of choking and coughing during feeds may be indicative of an underlying anatomical abnormality such as tracheoesophageal fistula or laryngomalacia. Urgent referral for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is warranted in this case to rule out any structural abnormalities that may require surgical intervention. Thickened feed or proton pump inhibitor therapy would not address the underlying cause of the symptoms, while stopping all solid foods may not be necessary if there are no other signs of food allergy or intolerance.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain at 22 weeks gestation.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pancreatic cancer
B. Cholangiocarcinoma
C. Acute cholecystitis
D. Primary sclerosing cholangitis
E. Gallbladder carcinoma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient’s presentation is consistent with cholangiocarcinoma which typically presents with obstructive jaundice, weight loss, right upper quadrant pain, and elevated CA 19-9 levels.

Question
A 32-year-old woman in her third pregnancy presents to the labour ward at 39 weeks gestation with regular contractions and a history of previous caesarean section. On examination, she is found to have a fully dilated cervix with the head at +1 station. The cardiotocography shows evidence of fetal distress with late decelerations and reduced variability. The obstetrician decides to proceed with an instrumental delivery but encounters difficulty due to a large caput succedaneum on the baby's scalp. What are the potential complications associated with this? 

A. Cerebral palsy
B. Intracranial hemorrhage
C. Neonatal sepsis 
D. Shoulder dystocia 
E. Postpartum haemorrhage

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Caput succedaneum is swelling that occurs on a newborn's scalp during vaginal delivery as pressure is applied by the mother’s pelvic bones or from vacuum extraction or forceps use during delivery. It usually resolves within several days without any intervention, however, if it is extensive, it can cause significant blood loss into the soft tissues of the scalp leading to jaundice, hypotension, anaemia and intracranial hemorrhage.

Question
A 28-year-old primigravida presents at term in spontaneous labour with regular contractions lasting for over one minute every five minutes and increasing in intensity over time. She has been pushing for two hours without progress despite adequate analgesia and hydration measures being taken throughout labour so far. On examination, there is no evidence of cephalopelvic disproportion or malpresentation; however, there is meconium-stained liquor present on rupture of membranes earlier in labour which was clear initially.
What should be done next? 

A) Continue expectant management 
B) Perform an emergency caesarean section 
C) Attempt vacuum extraction 
D) Administer oxytocin infusion 
E) Perform an episiotomy

Correct Answer: B 

Explanation: Prolonged second stage of labour is defined as a duration of more than two hours in primigravidas and one hour in multigravidas. In the presence of meconium-stained liquor, there is an increased risk of fetal distress due to aspiration syndrome which can cause respiratory failure and hypoxia. Therefore, emergency caesarean section should be performed.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents at term with regular contractions lasting for over one minute every five minutes and increasing in intensity over time. She has been pushing for three hours without progress despite adequate analgesia and hydration measures being taken throughout labour so far. On examination, there is evidence of cephalopelvic disproportion with the head at +2 station but no evidence of malpresentation or fetal distress.
What would be the most appropriate next step? 

A) Continue expectant management
B) Perform an instrumental delivery
C) Administer oxytocin infusion
D) Proceed with vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC)
E) Perform a trial of rotational forceps

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In cases where there is no evidence of fetal distress and previous lower segment caesarean section was done for non-recurrent indications such as breech presentation or maternal request, VBAC can be attempted if there are no other contraindications such as placenta praevia or transverse lie.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a laceration on her left hand. She reports that she was cutting vegetables when the knife slipped and cut through her skin, causing significant bleeding. On examination, there is a deep laceration involving the flexor tendons of her index finger.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? Should you repair the tendon? What are the potential complications? How long will it take for complete recovery? What factors should be considered before deciding on surgical intervention?

A. Proceed with immediate surgical repair
B. Wait for spontaneous healing
C. Refer to a specialist hand surgeon for further evaluation
D. Initiate conservative treatment with immobilization and physiotherapy 
E. Administer antibiotics prophylactically 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The management of flexor tendon injuries requires careful consideration as these structures are essential for normal hand function. Factors such as patient age, occupation, mechanism of injury, time since injury, and associated injuries must be taken into account before deciding on surgical intervention or conservative treatment options. In this case, referral to a specialist hand surgeon is necessary for further evaluation and management.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with an infected wound on his leg caused by a dog bite sustained two days ago while walking in the park. He reports fever, chills, and increasing pain at the site of injury despite cleaning it regularly at home.

On examination, there is erythema surrounding the wound with purulent discharge from the puncture marks.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? Should you prescribe antibiotics? If so, which one? For how long? Are there any contraindications? What other measures can be taken to prevent infection?

A. Prescribe amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7-10 days
B. Prescribe ciprofloxacin for 7-10 days
C. Prescribe doxycycline for 14 days 
D. Advise wound irrigation and debridement with saline solution 
E. Refer to a specialist in infectious diseases 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for all bite wounds, especially those caused by dogs as they are the most common source of infection. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the first-line antibiotic choice due to its broad-spectrum coverage against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly found in animal bites. The duration of treatment should be 7-10 days, and patients should be advised on wound care measures such as cleaning the wound thoroughly with soap and water, applying topical antiseptics, and monitoring for signs of infection.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after sustaining a laceration on her forehead following a car accident. On examination, there is a deep laceration involving the frontalis muscle with exposed bone visible.

A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset weakness of his left arm and leg, which started while he was at work. On examination, there is a complete loss of power in the left upper limb and 2/5 strength in the left lower limb. The patient also reports sensory changes on the left side of his body. His cranial nerve examination is normal.

Further investigations reveal an infarct in the right middle cerebral artery territory.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

A. Embolism from a cardiac source
B. Carotid artery dissection
C. Intracranial arterial stenosis
D. Meningioma compressing the internal carotid artery
E. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The symptoms described are consistent with a hemispheric stroke affecting the right middle cerebral artery territory, resulting in contralateral motor and sensory deficits involving predominantly the upper limb and face (due to cortical representation). Causes of intracranial arterial stenosis include atherosclerosis, vasculitis, Moyamoya disease, fibromuscular dysplasia or radiation-induced vasculopathy.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP with progressive weakness over several months that has affected both her arms and legs equally. She has no other neurological symptoms but reports significant fatigue and weight loss recently.

On examination, there is symmetrical proximal muscle weakness affecting all four limbs, as well as mild neck flexor weakness without any sensory abnormalities or reflex changes.

Laboratory tests show elevated creatine kinase levels and positive anti-Jo-1 antibodies.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Inclusion body myositis 
B. Polymyositis 
C. Dermatomyositis 
D. Myasthenia gravis 
E. Lambert-Eaton syndrome

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation is consistent with polymyositis, an autoimmune myopathy that affects proximal muscles symmetrically and can be associated with other systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss. Elevated creatine kinase levels are indicative of muscle damage, while positive anti-Jo-1 antibodies are seen in up to 20% of patients with polymyositis.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset weakness of his left arm and leg that started while he was playing tennis. On examination, there is complete paralysis of the left upper limb and 3/5 strength in the left lower limb. There is also a sensory deficit on the left side of his body.

A CT scan shows no evidence of haemorrhage or infarction.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Transient ischemic attack
B. Intracerebral haemorrhage
C. Subarachnoid haemorrhage
D. Spinal cord injury
E. Functional neurological disorder

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The absence of any radiological abnormalities suggests a functional neurological disorder (FND), which can present with sudden onset weakness affecting one side of the body without any organic cause identified on imaging studies or laboratory tests. FNDs are thought to arise from psychological factors rather than structural lesions, although they can coexist with other medical conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders.

Question
A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a limp and pain in his left hip that has been worsening over the past few weeks. He denies any history of trauma or recent illness.

Explanation: Given the severity of symptoms and previous diagnosis of endometriosis, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are an appropriate next step to manage heavy menstrual bleeding due to their ability to suppress ovarian function and reduce estrogen levels.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with a complaint of irregular periods over the last year since she stopped taking combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs). Her periods have been occurring every 35-40 days instead of her usual cycle length of 28 days while on COCPs. She reports no pain or other associated symptoms during her periods, but is concerned about fertility as she plans to conceive within the next year.

What is the most likely cause of her menstrual irregularity? 

A. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
B. Hypothyroidism
C. Premature ovarian failure
D. Asherman's syndrome
E. Endometrial hyperplasia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The most common cause of menstrual irregularity in women of reproductive age is PCOS, which can lead to infrequent or absent periods due to anovulation. Other causes such as hypothyroidism and premature ovarian failure should also be considered but are less likely given the patient's age.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with a complaint of severe dysmenorrhea for the past year. She reports experiencing cramping pain that starts before her period and lasts throughout its duration, despite taking over-the-counter analgesics. The pain is associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea during her periods. Her medical history includes hypertension, for which she takes lisinopril daily.

What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? 

A. Combined hormonal contraceptives 
B. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
C. Progestin-only pill
D. Referral for laparoscopic evaluation
E. Discontinuation of lisinopril

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Given the severity of symptoms and lack of response to NSAIDs, referral for laparoscopic evaluation is warranted to rule out endometriosis as a potential cause of dysmenorrhea in this patient.

Question
A 56-year-old male patient with a history of esophageal cancer underwent an esophagectomy and gastric pull-up procedure. The patient is now in the postoperative period, and the medical team has decided to insert a nasogastric (NG) tube for enteral feeding. After insertion, the NG tube was aspirated, but no contents were obtained. The medical team decides to check the placement of the NG tube.
Which method should be used to confirm correct placement? Should it be:

A. Aspirate and test pH
B. Commence NG feed and monitor oxygen saturations
C. Perform a chest X-ray (CXR)
D. Check midline descent on CXR before crossing to left-hand side
E. Use ultrasound to visualize the position of the NG tube

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients who have undergone upper gastrointestinal surgery or have anatomical abnormalities, such as those with esophageal cancer who have had an esophagectomy and gastric pull-up procedure, checking for correct placement of an NG tube can be challenging due to altered anatomy and potential complications like perforation or misplacement into other structures such as trachea or bronchi. Therefore, performing a CXR is recommended as it provides direct visualization of the tip of the NG tube in relation to surrounding structures.

Question
A 45-year-old female patient presents with severe abdominal pain that started suddenly after eating a large meal at dinner time last night. She also reports nausea and vomiting since then but denies any bowel movements or passing gas since onset of symptoms.
On examination, her abdomen is distended with diffuse tenderness on palpation without guarding or rebound tenderness.
The medical team decides to insert an NG tube for decompression.
What is the most appropriate way to confirm correct placement? Should it be:

A. Aspirate and test pH
B. Commence NG feed and monitor oxygen saturations
C. Perform a chest X-ray (CXR)
D. Check midline descent on CXR before crossing to left-hand side
E. Use ultrasound to visualize the position of the NG tube

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In patients with suspected bowel obstruction, checking for correct placement of an NG tube is important as misplacement can lead to complications such as aspiration or perforation. Performing a CXR is recommended, but in cases where there is concern about potential lung collapse due to air insufflation during insertion, it may be necessary to check for midline descent on CXR before crossing over to the left-hand side.

Question
A 62-year-old male patient presents with severe abdominal pain that started suddenly after eating a large meal at dinner time last night. He also reports nausea and vomiting since then but denies any bowel movements or passing gas since onset of symptoms.
On examination, his abdomen is distended with diffuse tenderness on palpation without guarding or rebound tenderness.
The medical team decides to insert an NG tube for decompression; however, three attempts at insertion are unsuccessful.
What should be done next? Should it be:

A. Repeat attempts at insertion until successful
B. Proceed with surgical intervention
C. Use fluoroscopy guidance for insertion
D. Insert an oral gastric tube instead
E. Abandon further attempts at insertion

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In cases where multiple attempts at NG tube insertion have failed, other methods such as using fluoroscopy guidance can be considered before proceeding with more invasive interventions like surgery or abandoning further attempts altogether. Fluoroscopy allows real-time visualization of the passage of the NG tube through the esophagus and into the stomach, increasing accuracy and reducing complications associated with blind insertion techniques.

C. Osteolysis 
D. Periosteal reaction 
E. Subchondral sclerosis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO), an inflammatory disorder affecting multiple bones characterized by recurrent episodes of bone pain, swelling and warmth without any systemic symptoms like fever or malaise. Radiological features include periosteal reaction, cortical thickening and lytic lesions which may resemble malignancy but are usually sterile on culture.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of nail changes in both hands for the past six months. He reports that he has been experiencing a dull pain and stiffness in his fingers, which is worse in the morning and improves as the day progresses. On examination, there are multiple pits on the nails with discoloration and thickening of the nail plate. There is also tenderness over the proximal interphalangeal joints and swelling of the distal interphalangeal joints.

Which one of the following conditions is most likely causing these findings? 

A. Rheumatoid arthritis
B. Systemic lupus erythematosus
C. Osteoarthritis
D. Psoriatic arthritis 
E. Scleroderma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of psoriatic arthritis, which commonly affects the nails resulting in pitting, discoloration, and thickening of the nail plate. In addition, patients may have joint involvement with characteristic features such as dactylitis (swelling of an entire digit) and asymmetrical oligoarticular arthritis affecting mainly small joints like those seen in this patient.

Question
A 30-year-old female presents to her dermatologist with concerns about changes in her fingernails for several months now. She reports that she has noticed horizontal ridges across all her nails that seem to be growing out slowly but steadily from their base towards their tips; however, she denies any history of trauma or recent illness.

Which one of the following conditions could be responsible for these findings? 

A. Lichen planus
B. Alopecia areata
C. Raynaud's phenomenon 
D. Kawasaki disease 
E. Chronic renal failure

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Horizontal ridges across all nails can be seen in chronic renal failure due to impaired protein synthesis. The ridges are known as Beau's lines and represent a temporary cessation of nail growth due to systemic illness or trauma. Other causes of Beau's lines include chemotherapy, severe infections, malnutrition, and hypothyroidism.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of painful swelling in the distal interphalangeal joints of both hands for the past six months. On examination, there is erythema and tenderness over the affected joints along with pitting, onycholysis (separation of the nail from its bed), and subungual hyperkeratosis in some fingers.

Which one of the following conditions is most likely causing these findings? 

A. Gout
B. Osteoarthritis 
C. Psoriatic arthritis
D. Rheumatoid arthritis 
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis with characteristic features such as symmetrical polyarticular involvement affecting mainly small joints like those seen in this patient's hands along with nail changes like pitting, onycholysis, and subungual hyperkeratosis that can be seen in up to 50% of patients with RA.

Question
A 32-year-old male presents with a history of nasal obstruction, facial pain, and headache for the past six months. He has been treated multiple times with antibiotics and decongestants but his symptoms have persisted. On examination, there is tenderness over the maxillary sinuses and nasal endoscopy reveals mucopurulent discharge from the middle meatus. CT scan shows opacification of the left maxillary sinus with thickening of its walls. What would be the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Endoscopic sinus surgery
B. Intranasal corticosteroids
C. Oral antibiotics 
D. Nasal saline irrigation 
E. Allergy testing

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) which is refractory to medical treatment, as evidenced by persistent symptoms despite multiple courses of antibiotics and decongestants. Endoscopic sinus surgery is indicated when medical therapy fails to control CRS.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a one-month history of right-sided nasal obstruction that has progressively worsened over time. She also reports occasional epistaxis on blowing her nose and a feeling of fullness in her right ear along with mild hearing loss on that side. On examination, there is a pinkish mass occupying almost all of the right nasal cavity extending into the nasopharynx without crossing midline or involving other structures around it.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Inverted papilloma
B. Angiofibroma
C. Squamous cell carcinoma
D. Adenoid cystic carcinoma
E. Esthesioneuroblastoma

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests an inverted papilloma which typically arises from lateral wall or roof of sinonasal cavities and can extend into adjacent areas including nasopharynx while remaining confined to one side. It is a benign but locally aggressive tumour that has high recurrence rates and carries the risk of malignant transformation.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents with a history of nasal obstruction, anosmia, and postnasal drip for the past year. He reports having undergone multiple surgeries in the past for recurrent nasal polyps.

What would be the most appropriate next step? 

A. Repeat surgery
B. Intranasal corticosteroids 
C. Oral corticosteroids 
D. CT scan of paranasal sinuses 
E. Biopsy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests recurrent sinonasal polyposis which may require further surgical intervention; however, biopsy should be performed first to exclude malignancy as well as other conditions such as fungal sinusitis or inverted papilloma that can mimic polyps on imaging studies.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a two-week history of persistent nausea and vomiting, which has been worsening over the last few days. He reports feeling bloated and having abdominal pain. His medical history is significant for peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On examination, he appears dehydrated and uncomfortable. His abdomen is distended and tender on palpation.

Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate in this patient?

A. Abdominal ultrasound
B. Barium swallow
C. CT scan of the abdomen
D. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract obstruction or gastroparesis, which can be caused by various conditions such as gastric outlet obstruction or diabetic neuropathy affecting GI motility. EGD is a minimally invasive procedure that allows direct visualization of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to identify any structural abnormalities or mucosal lesions that may be causing his symptoms.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting after eating meals for several months now. She reports no other associated symptoms but notes that she has lost some weight unintentionally over this period despite maintaining her usual diet.

Her medical history is unremarkable except for a previous diagnosis of anxiety disorder for which she takes sertraline regularly.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms? 

A. Anxiety disorder 
B. Biliary colic 
C. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 
D. Peptic ulcer disease 
E Pancreatitis 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with GERD, which occurs due to the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus, causing irritation and inflammation. The loss of weight despite maintaining her usual diet is suggestive of chronic inflammation or malabsorption. Anxiety disorder may exacerbate GERD symptoms but is not typically a primary cause.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to his oncologist with complaints of persistent nausea and vomiting for several weeks now. He has a history of metastatic lung cancer and has been receiving chemotherapy for the last six months. His current medications include dexamethasone, ondansetron, and oxycodone.

On examination, he appears pale and dehydrated. His abdomen is soft but tender on palpation in the epigastric region.

Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate in this patient? 

A. Abdominal ultrasound 
B. CT scan of the abdomen 
C. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) 
D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen 
E. Serum electrolytes

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are likely due to chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), which can occur as an adverse effect of many chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer treatment. Dexamethasone and ondansetron are commonly used antiemetic drugs that can help manage CINV; however, they can also cause electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia or hyponatremia, leading to dehydration and other complications if left untreated. Therefore, serum electrolyte levels should be checked promptly to guide further management decisions.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to her GP with a lump on the right side of her neck that has been present for several months. She reports no other symptoms and is otherwise well. On examination, there is an enlarged lymph node (2x3 cm) located in the right posterior cervical chain. The lump feels hard and irregular. There is no supra/infraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Blood tests reveal elevated inflammatory markers but are otherwise unremarkable.
Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate at this stage? 

A. Fine needle aspiration cytology
B. Excisional biopsy
C. CT scan of the neck
D. PET-CT scan
E. MRI of the neck

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Given the patient's age, duration of symptoms, and presence of elevated inflammatory markers, malignancy must be ruled out as a cause of the neck lump before proceeding with further investigations or management options. While fine needle aspiration cytology may provide some information about the nature of the mass, it may not definitively rule out malignancy or provide enough diagnostic information to guide treatment decisions. Excisional biopsy carries a higher risk of complications and should only be considered if less invasive measures fail to establish a diagnosis or if malignancy is strongly suspected based on clinical findings or imaging results.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with a painless left-sided neck swelling that has been gradually increasing in size over several months. He denies any associated systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats but reports occasional difficulty swallowing solid foods due to pressure sensation in his throat.
On examination, there is an enlarged lymph node (4x5 cm) located in the left supraclavicular fossa which appears fixed to surrounding structures and does not move with swallowing or tongue protrusion.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Metastatic carcinoma
B. Lymphoma
C. Thyroid nodule
D. Branchial cleft cyst
E. Carotid body tumor

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The supraclavicular fossa is a common site for metastatic lymphadenopathy due to its location at the junction of the head and neck with the thorax, where lymphatic drainage from multiple organs converges. The presence of a large, fixed mass in this region raises concern for malignancy, particularly if there is no obvious primary source elsewhere in the body or if other systemic symptoms are present.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with a lump on the right side of her neck that has been gradually increasing in size over several months. She reports occasional pain and tenderness around the area but denies any associated fever or weight loss.
On examination, there is an enlarged lymph node (3x4 cm) located in the right posterior cervical chain which feels firm and irregular but not fixed to surrounding structures.
Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Fine needle aspiration cytology
B. Excisional biopsy
C. CT scan of the neck and chest
D. PET-CT scan
E. MRI of the neck

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: While fine needle aspiration cytology may provide some diagnostic information about the nature of the mass, it may not definitively rule out malignancy or provide enough diagnostic information to guide treatment decisions given its limited sample size and potential for false negatives or inconclusive results. CT scan or PET-CT scan may be useful in identifying other sites of disease involvement or assessing overall disease burden, but they do not replace tissue diagnosis as a gold standard for establishing a definitive diagnosis and guiding management decisions. Excisional biopsy carries a higher risk of complications than less invasive measures such as FNA but provides more comprehensive tissue sampling and histopathological analysis, which can help differentiate between benign and malignant causes of the neck lump.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with neck pain that has been present for the last 6 months. She describes a dull ache in her neck that radiates down to her shoulders and upper back. The pain is worse when she wakes up in the morning and improves throughout the day. She denies any history of trauma or recent illnesses.

E. Meningitis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with cervical spondylosis, which is a degenerative condition affecting the spinal discs and joints in the neck region.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to his GP with neck stiffness and headaches that have been present for several weeks. He reports feeling fatigued and having difficulty concentrating at work due to his symptoms.
On examination, there is tenderness over the occipital region with limited range of motion of the neck. Neurological examination reveals no abnormalities.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Tension headache
B. Cluster headache
C. Migraine headache
D. Cervicogenic headache
E. Sinus headache

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with cervicogenic headache, which originates from structures in the cervical spine.

Question
A 55-year-old male presents to his GP with severe neck pain that started suddenly after he woke up one morning about a week ago.He also complains of numbness and tingling sensation on both arms along with weakness while lifting objects.On examination,there was reduced strength in biceps,triceps and wrist extension with reduced sensation in both upper limbs.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cervical radiculopathy
B. Brachial plexus injury
C. Carpal tunnel syndrome
D. Thoracic outlet syndrome
E. Multiple sclerosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with cervical radiculopathy, which occurs due to compression or irritation of a nerve root in the cervical spine leading to pain,numbness and weakness along the distribution of that particular nerve root.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 34 weeks gestation with a history of reduced fetal movements for the past 24 hours. The ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid and an estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile. She is admitted for monitoring and given steroids for lung maturation.

At 35 weeks, she goes into spontaneous labour and delivers a male neonate weighing 1.8 kg with APGAR scores of 3,4,5 at 1,5 and 10 minutes respectively. The baby is intubated and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) where he receives surfactant therapy.

On day three of life, the baby develops apnoeas and bradycardias requiring bag-mask ventilation. Blood cultures are negative but cerebrospinal fluid culture grows group B streptococcus (GBS). He is started on intravenous antibiotics.

What is the most appropriate management of this neonate? 

A. Continue current treatment
B. Add vancomycin to cover resistant organisms
C. Discontinue antibiotics as blood cultures were negative
D. Perform lumbar puncture to confirm meningitis
E. Start therapeutic hypothermia

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Given that CSF culture grew GBS in this case, it is important to confirm if there is meningitis by performing a lumbar puncture before continuing or changing antibiotic therapy.

Question
A full-term infant born via normal vaginal delivery develops sudden onset respiratory distress shortly after birth with oxygen saturation dropping to less than 80%. Chest X-ray reveals bilateral diffuse infiltrates suggestive of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).

The baby requires mechanical ventilation with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation mode due to persistent hypoxemia despite maximal conventional ventilation settings including nitric oxide inhalation.

On day five of life, the baby's condition deteriorates with worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia. The arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.15, pCO2 of 80 mmHg, and bicarbonate of 25 mEq/L.

What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Increase ventilator settings
B. Perform extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
C. Administer inhaled epoprostenol
D. Start continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)
E. Initiate therapeutic hypothermia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: ECMO should be considered in neonates with severe respiratory failure who are not responding to maximal conventional ventilation strategies including nitric oxide inhalation.

Question
A 3-month-old baby girl presents to the emergency department with sudden onset apnoea and cyanosis while sleeping on her back at home. She was born full-term via normal vaginal delivery without any complications and has been growing well since birth.

On examination, she is unresponsive with no spontaneous breathing or heart rate detected despite advanced life support measures initiated immediately by the medical team.

E. Multiple sclerosis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and wasting, dysphagia, dysarthria, and respiratory failure. Elevated creatine kinase levels are not typically seen in ALS but may be present due to secondary muscle damage.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent episodes of muscle weakness affecting her legs for the past year. She describes feeling fatigued after walking short distances and having difficulty climbing stairs or standing from a seated position without assistance during these episodes. Her symptoms improve with rest but recur frequently despite treatment with corticosteroids.

On examination, there is mild proximal muscle weakness in both legs (MRC grade 4/5) with preserved distal strength and normal sensation. Reflexes are intact bilaterally.

What is the most likely diagnosis based on these features? 

A. Polymyositis
B. Dermatomyositis
C. Inclusion body myositis
D. Mitochondrial myopathy
E. McArdle disease

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with a mitochondrial myopathy, which typically presents in young adults with recurrent episodes of exercise intolerance and muscle weakness affecting the proximal muscles. Symptoms may improve with rest but recur frequently despite treatment with corticosteroids. Sensory loss and reflex abnormalities are not typically seen in mitochondrial myopathies.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with a history of progressive muscle weakness over the past year, which has now affected his ability to walk and perform daily activities. He also reports difficulty swallowing and speaking. On examination, he has bilateral ptosis, facial weakness, and proximal muscle weakness in all limbs (MRC grade 3/5). There is no sensory loss or reflex abnormalities. Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis based on these features? 

A. Myasthenia gravis
B. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
C. Inclusion body myositis 
D. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome 
E. Multiple sclerosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with inclusion body myositis (IBM), an inflammatory myopathy that affects older adults and typically presents with progressive muscle weakness affecting the distal muscles initially before progressing to involve the proximal muscles as well as bulbar musculature leading to dysphagia and dysarthria. Elevated creatine kinase levels are commonly seen in IBM along with characteristic histological findings on muscle biopsy such as rimmed vacuoles and inflammatory infiltrates.

Question
A 55-year-old female presents to her GP with a complaint of night sweats for the past six months.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with bilateral nipple discharge which is blood-stained and occurs spontaneously without any manipulation of the breast. She has no family history of breast cancer, but she is on hormonal contraception. On examination, there are no palpable masses or lymphadenopathy. What is the most likely cause of her symptoms? Describe the investigations you would perform to confirm your diagnosis.

A. Intraductal papilloma
B. Breast cancer
C. Duct ectasia
D. Fibrocystic changes
E. Paget's disease of the breast

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The most common cause of bloody nipple discharge in premenopausal women is an intraductal papilloma, a benign tumor that arises from the epithelial lining of mammary ducts and protrudes into their lumen causing obstruction and bleeding. Other causes include breast cancer, duct ectasia, fibrocystic changes, and Paget's disease of the breast. To confirm the diagnosis, imaging studies such as mammography or ultrasound should be performed to identify any underlying mass or calcifications within the ducts. Additionally, cytological analysis or biopsy may be necessary to rule out malignancy.

Question
A 50-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with unilateral serous nipple discharge which has been present for several months and does not resolve spontaneously despite conservative management with antibiotics and topical creams. Her past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia treated with medications; she denies any previous surgeries or radiation therapy to her chest area. On examination, there are no palpable masses or skin changes noted in either breast; however, milky fluid can be expressed from both nipples upon squeezing them gently. What is the most likely diagnosis? Describe how you would manage this patient.

A. Breast cancer
B. Prolactinoma
C. Fat necrosis of the breast
D. Galactorrhea-amenorrhea syndrome
E. Intraductal papilloma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in this case is a prolactinoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that secretes excessive amounts of prolactin hormone leading to galactorrhea (milky nipple discharge) and amenorrhea (absent or irregular menstrual periods). Other causes of galactorrhea include medications such as antipsychotics and antidepressants, hypothyroidism, and breast stimulation. Management involves treating the underlying cause if possible; for example, discontinuing offending medications or correcting thyroid dysfunction. If no reversible cause is identified, dopamine agonist therapy such as cabergoline may be initiated to reduce prolactin levels.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with unilateral bloody nipple discharge which occurs spontaneously without any palpable masses or skin changes noted on examination. She has no family history of breast cancer but reports having undergone radiation therapy to her chest area for Hodgkin's lymphoma during her teenage years. Mammography shows scattered calcifications throughout both breasts with no suspicious lesions identified. What is the most likely cause of her symptoms? Describe how you would manage this patient.

A. Breast cancer
B. Duct ectasia
C. Fibrocystic changes
D. Radiation-induced injury
E. Paget's disease of the breast

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Radiation-induced injury to the breast tissue can lead to various long-term complications including fibrosis, atrophy, telangiectasias, and ductal abnormalities such as stenosis or occlusion resulting in nipple discharge or retraction. The risk of developing radiation-induced breast cancer is also increased in these patients compared to the general population; therefore close surveillance with regular mammograms and clinical exams are recommended starting at an earlier age than usual screening guidelines. Management of nipple discharge in this patient involves ruling out malignancy with imaging studies and biopsy if necessary, as well as addressing any underlying ductal abnormalities or infections with antibiotics or surgery.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 28 weeks gestation with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She has had three UTIs in this pregnancy so far, all treated successfully with antibiotics. Her current urine dipstick shows leukocytes and nitrites. On examination, she is otherwise well, with no fever or abdominal tenderness.

What would be your next step in management?

A. Prescribe prophylactic antibiotics until delivery
B. Perform a mid-stream urine culture
C. Refer for urological assessment
D. Increase fluid intake and retest urine in one week
E. Repeat urine dipstick at next antenatal appointment

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Given her history of recurrent UTIs and positive dipstick, it is important to confirm the presence of infection through a mid-stream urine culture before starting prophylactic antibiotics.

Which one of the following investigations should not be routinely offered at this stage?

A. Full blood count
B. Blood group and antibody screen
C. Rubella immunity status
D. Hepatitis B surface antigen testing
E. Human immunodeficiency virus testing

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: While a full blood count may be useful later in pregnancy to monitor for anaemia or thrombocytopenia, it is not routinely performed at the first antenatal appointment unless there are specific indications such as pre-existing haematological conditions.

Question
A 36-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 32 weeks gestation with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She has no significant medical history and this is her second pregnancy, with an uneventful first pregnancy resulting in a normal vaginal delivery.

On examination, she is pale and clammy, with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness and guarding in all quadrants, with no palpable fetal movements or heart sounds.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Placental abruption
B. Ectopic pregnancy
C. Uterine rupture
D. Preterm labour
E. Cervical incompetence

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Placental abruption is a serious obstetric emergency that can present with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, as well as signs of shock such as hypotension and tachycardia.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is known to have cirrhosis of the liver. On examination, his abdomen is distended and tender on palpation. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. An ultrasound scan shows hepatomegaly with evidence of portal hypertension. The patient is diagnosed with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
Which one of the following statements regarding acute alcoholic hepatitis is correct?

A. It occurs only in patients who consume more than 100 units of alcohol per week
B. Treatment involves high-dose corticosteroids for at least six months
C. Liver biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis if clinical criteria are met
D. Abstinence from alcohol can reverse the condition completely
E. Prognosis is poor regardless of treatment

A. More than 100 units of alcohol per week may increase the risk but it does not guarantee that someone will develop acute alcoholic hepatitis.
B. High dose corticosteroids are used initially but should be tapered off over four weeks.
C. Liver biopsy remains important in confirming diagnosis as well as assessing severity.
D. Abstinence from alcohol can improve prognosis but complete reversal may not occur.
E.Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) results from prolonged heavy drinking leading to inflammation and damage to the liver cells which can lead to organomegaly such as hepatomegaly or splenomegaly due to portal hypertension caused by scarring (cirrhosis). AAH can present acutely with symptoms like abdominal pain, jaundice, fever, nausea/vomiting etc., laboratory findings include elevated transaminases, bilirubin, INR etc., imaging studies show hepatomegaly/splenomegaly/ascites/varices etc., Diagnosis requires a combination of clinical, laboratory and histological features. Treatment involves abstinence from alcohol which can improve prognosis but complete reversal may not occur.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to the clinic with a three-month history of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats and fever. She reports no cough or shortness of breath. On examination, she has cervical lymphadenopathy that is firm and non-tender. Blood tests reveal an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest X-ray is normal. CT scan shows multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, chest and abdomen with evidence of splenomegaly.
Which one of the following conditions is most likely?

A. Sarcoidosis
B. Tuberculosis
C. Hodgkin's lymphoma
D. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
E. Infectious mononucleosis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient’s symptoms are suggestive of a systemic illness such as malignancy or infection leading to organomegaly like splenomegaly or hepatomegaly etc., Lymph node enlargement suggests involvement by malignant cells rather than granulomatous disease like sarcoidosis or tuberculosis where there would be caseating necrosis on biopsy instead of malignant cells seen in lymphomas like Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting for two weeks associated with jaundice and pruritus for one week prior to presentation.He also complains of significant weight loss over the last few months.On examination he appears cachectic with mild icterus.His liver edge is palpable at 4 cm below right costal margin.The spleen tip is also palpable just below left costal margin.Blood tests show raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels.A CT scan of the abdomen shows a large pancreatic mass with multiple liver metastases.
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chronic pancreatitis
B. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
C. Neuroendocrine tumour
D. Cholangiocarcinoma 
E. Hepatocellular carcinoma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient’s symptoms are suggestive of obstructive jaundice which can be caused by malignant or benign conditions like choledocholithiasis, cholangitis etc., but in this case there is also organomegaly like hepatomegaly and splenomegaly along with significant weight loss which raises suspicion for malignancy.Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are known to cause these symptoms due to its location near important structures like bile ducts, duodenum etc., and early spread to organs such as liver leading to metastasis.

Question
A 25-year-old male is brought to the Emergency Department (ED) by his friends after they found him unconscious in his apartment. The patient has a history of depression and had been prescribed an antidepressant medication two weeks ago. Upon arrival, he is drowsy with pinpoint pupils, respiratory rate of 8/min, blood pressure of 90/60mmHg, and heart rate of 120bpm.

E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presentation of sudden onset chest pain that worsens on inspiration can be caused by various conditions such as PE, ACS, pneumothorax or pleuritis. It is important to consider all these possibilities in order to make an accurate diagnosis.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents to her GP with right-sided chest pain that increases with deep inspiration and coughing for the past two days. She reports no fever or shortness of breath but does have a dry cough and mild fatigue for the same duration. Her medical history includes asthma which she had been managing well until now.

On examination, there are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base without any added sounds or crepitations elsewhere in both lungs.
Which one of the following diagnoses would you consider? 

A. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
B. Asthma exacerbation
C. Pneumonia
D Costochondritis
E Pleural effusion

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In this case, the patient has a history of asthma and presents with chest pain that increases with deep inspiration and coughing. However, there are no added sounds or crepitations on examination which makes pneumonia or PE less likely. The decreased breath sounds over the right lung base suggest costochondritis as the most probable diagnosis.

Question
A 68-year-old male presents to the emergency department with sudden onset left-sided chest pain that is worse on inspiration. He describes it as sharp and stabbing in nature and radiating to his back. He denies any shortness of breath, palpitations or fever but reports mild nausea since the onset of symptoms. His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he takes medication regularly.

On examination, he appears uncomfortable but not in distress. His blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, heart rate is 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation is 96% on room air and temperature is normal.
What would be your initial investigation? 

A. ECG
B. Chest X-ray
C. CT angiogram
D. Blood tests including troponin levels
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation of sudden onset chest pain that worsens on inspiration can be caused by various conditions such as ACS or pulmonary embolism (PE). In this case, given the patient's age and comorbidities along with his symptoms, an ACS should be considered first before other possibilities like PE or pleuritis. Therefore, an ECG and blood tests including troponin levels should be done initially to rule out myocardial infarction as a cause of his chest pain before proceeding to further investigations if necessary.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe left ear pain that started suddenly while he was sleeping. He describes the pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation that radiates down his neck and into his jaw. On examination, there is no discharge or swelling visible in the external auditory canal, but there is tenderness on palpation of the mastoid process. The tympanic membrane appears normal. The patient reports a history of recurrent otitis media as a child and has had several episodes of vertigo over the past year.
Which of the following options is most likely to be responsible for this patient's symptoms? 

A. Acoustic neuroma
B. Bell's palsy

A. Deep vein thrombosis
B. Cellulitis
C. Acute arterial occlusion
D. Lymphedema
E. Baker's cyst rupture

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which should be suspected in any patient presenting with unilateral lower extremity swelling and pain without an obvious cause such as trauma or cellulitis.

Question
A 68-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of persistent pain and swelling in his right calf for several months despite conservative management including compression stockings and elevation at night. He reports no history of trauma or DVT but does have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

Which of the following imaging studies would be most appropriate for further evaluation?

A. Duplex ultrasound
B. Magnetic resonance angiography
C. Computed tomography angiography
D. Venogram
E. X-ray

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In cases where chronic venous insufficiency is suspected despite conservative management, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can provide detailed visualization of both venous and arterial structures in the affected limb.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to her GP surgery complaining of bilateral leg pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest along with occasional numbness in her toes bilaterally for several months. She reports no history of trauma or DVT but does have a family history of autoimmune disease.

Which of the following laboratory tests would be most appropriate for further evaluation?

A. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
B. C-reactive protein
C. Antinuclear antibody
D. Rheumatoid factor
E. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is concerning for an underlying autoimmune disorder such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, which can present with symptoms of peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy. An antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is a screening tool used to detect autoantibodies that are commonly associated with these conditions.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with pallor, fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion for the past month. She reports no significant medical history but mentions that she has been following a strict vegan diet for the past year. On examination, her vitals are stable except for tachycardia at rest (110 bpm). Her conjunctiva is pale and there is mild splenomegaly palpable in the left upper quadrant. Blood work shows:
Haemoglobin: 7 g/dL (12–16 g/dL)
Mean cell volume: 80 fl (76–98 fl)
Reticulocyte count: 1%
Serum iron: 10 μmol/L (11–30 μmol/L)
Total iron-binding capacity: 70 μmol/L (45–72 μmol/L)

Which one of the following findings would most likely lead to the correct diagnosis? 

A. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies
B. Schistocytes on peripheral blood smear 
C. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels 
D. Positive Coombs test 
E. Elevated erythropoietin levels

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with anaemia due to nutritional deficiency, specifically vitamin B12 or folate deficiency; however, given her strict vegan diet, it is more likely that she has iron-deficiency anaemia due to inadequate dietary intake of iron-rich foods such as red meat and poultry. Option A refers to pernicious anaemia which can also cause megaloblastic anaemia but is not related to this case since there are no neurological symptoms present nor macrocytosis seen in MCV results. Option B refers to microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia which may be seen in conditions like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or disseminated intravascular coagulation, but there is no evidence of haemolysis in this case. Option C refers to elevated levels of LDH which may be seen in haemolytic anaemia or tissue damage, but again, there is no evidence of haemolysis and the patient's liver function tests are normal. Option D refers to autoimmune haemolytic anaemia which can cause a positive Coombs test, but there is no evidence of haemolysis in this case.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents with pallor and fatigue for the past month. He reports a history of chronic alcohol abuse and has been drinking heavily for the past year. On examination, his vitals are stable except for tachycardia at rest (110 bpm). His conjunctiva is pale and there is mild hepatosplenomegaly palpable on abdominal exam. Blood work shows:
Haemoglobin: 8 g/dL (12–16 g/dL)
Mean cell volume: 100 fl (76–98 fl)
Reticulocyte count: 2%
Serum bilirubin: 3 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL)

Which one of the following findings would most likely lead to the correct diagnosis? 

A. Elevated serum iron levels 
B. Positive direct antiglobulin test 
C. Elevated serum vitamin B12 levels
D. Macrocytosis on peripheral blood smear 
E. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic alcoholism-induced macrocytic anaemia due to folate deficiency; however, given his elevated bilirubin level and hepatosplenomegaly, it is more likely that he has alcoholic liver disease with associated haemolysis leading to anaemia. Option A refers to iron overload disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis which can cause iron deposition in organs like liver and pancreas leading to organ damage, but there is no evidence of this in the patient's case. Option C refers to vitamin B12 deficiency which can also cause megaloblastic anaemia but is not related to this case since there are no neurological symptoms present nor macrocytosis seen in MCV results. Option D refers to macrocytic anaemia due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, but the patient's MCV result falls within normal range for his age group. Option E refers to elevated levels of LDH which may be seen in haemolytic anaemia or tissue damage, but it does not provide any specific diagnosis.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents with pallor, fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion for the past month. She reports a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for the past year and has been using oral contraceptives for contraception. On examination, her vitals are stable except for tachycardia at rest (110 bpm). Her conjunctiva is pale and there is mild splenomegaly palpable on abdominal exam. Blood work shows:
Haemoglobin: 8 g/dL (12–16 g/dL)
Mean cell volume: 80 fl (76–98 fl)
Reticulocyte count: 1%
Serum ferritin: 10 ng/mL (15–150 ng/mL)

Which one of the following findings would most likely lead to the correct diagnosis? 

A. Elevated serum iron levels 
B. Positive direct antiglobulin test 
C. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels
D. Macrocytosis on peripheral blood smear 
E. Low serum transferrin saturation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with microcytic hypochromic anaemia due to iron-deficiency, likely caused by heavy menstrual bleeding. Option A refers to iron overload disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis which can cause iron deposition in organs like liver and pancreas leading to organ damage, but there is no evidence of this in the patient's case. Option B refers to autoimmune haemolytic anaemia which can cause a positive Coombs test, but there is no evidence of haemolysis in this case. Option C refers to elevated levels of LDH which may be seen in haemolytic anaemia or tissue damage, but it does not provide any specific diagnosis. Option D refers to macrocytic anaemia due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, but the patient's MCV result falls within normal range for her age group. Therefore, option E is the correct answer since low serum transferrin saturation indicates decreased availability of iron for erythropoiesis and supports the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anaemia.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a history of palpitations and shortness of breath that have been occurring for the past week. He reports feeling lightheaded during these episodes but has not fainted. On examination, his pulse is irregularly irregular at 120 bpm, blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, and there are no murmurs or gallops on cardiac auscultation. His ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Blood tests reveal elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Initiate rate control with beta-blockers 
B. Initiate rhythm control with amiodarone 
C. Perform electrical cardioversion 
D. Start anticoagulation therapy 
E. Refer to an endocrinologist for further evaluation 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with new-onset atrial fibrillation likely due to hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis). Anticoagulation therapy should be initiated immediately to prevent thromboembolic events while awaiting definitive treatment of the underlying condition.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of palpitations associated with chest pain and dyspnea over the past month. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease stage IIIa. Her medications include lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin.
On examination, her pulse is regular at 80 bpm, blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg, and there are no murmurs or gallops on cardiac auscultation.
Her ECG reveals ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6.
What is the most likely cause of her symptoms? 

A. Acute coronary syndrome
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Hypertensive emergency
D. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
E. Aortic dissection

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or "broken heart syndrome." This condition typically presents with acute chest pain and dyspnea in the setting of emotional or physical stress, and can mimic an acute coronary syndrome on ECG and biomarker testing. However, there is no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography, and the left ventricular dysfunction is usually reversible within weeks to months.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents with a history of recurrent episodes of palpitations associated with dizziness and near-syncope over the past year. He has no significant medical history and takes no medications.
On examination, his pulse is regular at 120 bpm, blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, and there are no murmurs or gallops on cardiac auscultation.
His resting ECG reveals sinus tachycardia with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Initiate beta-blocker therapy 
B. Perform exercise stress testing 
C. Obtain an echocardiogram 
D. Refer for electrophysiology study 
E. Reassure and monitor without intervention 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest possible paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) or other arrhythmias that may require further evaluation by electrophysiology study (EPS). Beta-blockers may be effective for rate control in PSVT but would not address the underlying arrhythmia mechanism. Exercise stress testing and echocardiography are unlikely to reveal significant abnormalities given the patient's age and lack of risk factors for structural heart disease.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a pelvic mass that was incidentally discovered on an ultrasound scan during a routine gynecological examination. The patient has no significant past medical history, and her family history is unremarkable. On examination, the patient appears well, and there are no palpable lymph nodes or hepatosplenomegaly. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a large multilocular cystic lesion in the pelvis measuring approximately 10 cm × 8 cm × 6 cm arising from the right ovary.
What is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient? 

A. Repeat transvaginal ultrasound in 3 months
B. CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast
C. MRI of the pelvis
D. CA-125 tumour marker measurement
E. Laparoscopic surgical exploration

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of a pelvic mass requires further evaluation to determine its nature and potential malignancy risk. In women over age 35 years, serum CA-125 levels should be measured as it can help differentiate between benign and malignant ovarian masses.

Question
A 28-year-old nulliparous woman presents with acute onset lower abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting for two days duration. She reports irregular menstrual cycles but denies any previous gynecological issues or sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Upon examination, she appears uncomfortable but not acutely ill-looking; her vital signs are within normal limits except for mild tachycardia at rest (HR=105 bpm). Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in both iliac fossae without rebound tenderness or guarding; bimanual pelvic exam reveals a tender left adnexal mass.
Which of the following imaging modalities would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast 
B. Pelvic ultrasonography 
C. MRI of the pelvis 
D. PET-CT scan 
E. Transvaginal ultrasound 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Pelvic ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial imaging modality for evaluating a suspected pelvic mass, as it can help determine its size, location, and characteristics.

Question
A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with a history of abdominal distension and discomfort for several months duration. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of ovarian cancer in her mother. On examination, she appears well; there are no palpable lymph nodes or hepatosplenomegaly. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a large solid mass arising from the right ovary measuring approximately 15 cm × 12 cm × 10 cm.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Ovarian fibroma
B. Serous cystadenoma
C. Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma
D. Brenner tumour
E. Ovarian carcinoma

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presence of a large solid mass in an older patient with a family history of ovarian cancer raises suspicion for malignancy, particularly epithelial ovarian carcinoma which accounts for about 90% of all malignant ovarian tumors.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with symptoms of poisoning after ingesting a large amount of an unknown substance. She is unconscious and has a respiratory rate of 8 breaths/min, pulse of 120 beats/min, temperature of 38.5ºC, blood pressure of 90/60mmHg and oxygen saturations of 85%. On examination, she has pinpoint pupils and muscle fasciculations.

Which one of the following antidotes should be administered immediately? 

A. Flumazenil
B. Naloxone
C. Atropine
D. Calcium gluconate
E. Pralidoxime

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests organophosphate poisoning which can cause respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, miosis and muscle fasciculations due to acetylcholine accumulation at muscarinic receptors in the body. Pralidoxime is an antidote that reactivates inhibited cholinesterase enzymes by binding to phosphorus atoms on organophosphates before irreversible aging occurs.

Question
A 25-year-old man is brought into the emergency department after being found unresponsive in his apartment with empty bottles of paracetamol tablets scattered around him. He admits to taking more than 20 grams over the past few hours.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. Activated charcoal 
B. Intravenous N-acetylcysteine 
C. Haemodialysis 
D. Intravenous vitamin K 
E. Oral methionine

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Paracetamol overdose can lead to hepatotoxicity due to depletion of glutathione stores in liver cells leading to oxidative stress and cell death if not treated promptly with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Activated charcoal can be used if the patient presents within 1 hour of ingestion to prevent further absorption. Haemodialysis is not indicated in paracetamol overdose as it does not remove the toxic metabolite from the blood.

Question
A 50-year-old man is brought into the emergency department after being found unconscious at home with a bottle of pesticide next to him. He has a respiratory rate of 6 breaths/min, pulse of 140 beats/min, temperature of 39ºC, blood pressure of 80/40mmHg and oxygen saturations of 75%.

Which one of the following medications should be avoided in this patient? 

A. Atropine 
B. Diazepam 
C. Morphine 
D. Midazolam 
E. Ketamine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests organophosphate poisoning which can cause respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, mydriasis and muscle fasciculations due to acetylcholine accumulation at muscarinic receptors in the body. Atropine is an antidote that blocks muscarinic receptors leading to increased heart rate and bronchodilation while diazepam or midazolam can be used for seizures or agitation respectively. However, morphine should be avoided as it may exacerbate respiratory depression by depressing central respiratory drive and decreasing airway resistance leading to worsening hypoxemia.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of excessive thirst and frequent urination for the past month. He has no significant medical history, but he reports a family history of diabetes mellitus. On examination, his blood pressure is within normal limits, and there are no signs of dehydration or edema. His fasting glucose level is 5.6 mmol/L (3-6mmol/L), and serum osmolality is 295 mOsmol/kg (275-295). The urine osmolality is measured before and after water deprivation, which shows a baseline value of 250 mOsmol/kg and post-deprivation value of 300 mOsmol/kg.

The patient undergoes a desmopressin test, where he receives an intranasal dose of desmopressin acetate at 10 pm. Urine samples are collected at midnight and again at 8 am the next day. The results show that the urine osmolality increased from 300 to 800 mOsmol/kg overnight.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus
B. Diabetes mellitus
C. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
D. Primary polydipsia
E. Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests primary polydipsia as the most likely diagnosis since there are no other signs or symptoms suggestive of any other underlying condition such as cranial or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or SIADH. The water deprivation test showed only mild evidence of polyuria, while the desmopressin test demonstrated an adequate response in terms of increasing urine concentration overnight.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of excessive thirst and frequent urination for several months. She has a medical history of hypertension and is currently taking lisinopril 10mg daily. On examination, her blood pressure is within normal limits, and there are no signs of dehydration or edema. Her fasting glucose level is 5.4 mmol/L (3-6mmol/L), and serum osmolality is 295 mOsmol/kg (275-295). The urine osmolality measured before and after water deprivation shows a baseline value of 250 mOsmol/kg and post-deprivation value of 300 mOsmol/kg.

The patient undergoes a desmopressin test, where she receives an intranasal dose of desmopressin acetate at 10 pm. Urine samples are collected at midnight and again at 8 am the next day. The results show that the urine osmolality increased from 300 to only 400 mOsmol/kg overnight.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus
B. Diabetes mellitus
C. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
D. Primary polydipsia
E. Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as the most likely diagnosis since there are no other signs or symptoms suggestive of any other underlying condition such as cranial diabetes insipidus, primary polydipsia, or SIADH. The water deprivation test showed mild evidence of polyuria, while the desmopressin test demonstrated an inadequate response in terms of increasing urine concentration overnight despite receiving an adequate dose.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of excessive thirst and frequent urination for several months along with fatigue and weight loss over the past few weeks. He has a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On examination, his blood pressure is elevated at 160/90 mmHg, and there are signs of dehydration with dry mucous membranes. His fasting glucose level is 15.6 mmol/L (3-6mmol/L), and serum osmolality is 320 mOsmol/kg (275-295). The urine osmolality measured before and after water deprivation shows a baseline value of 250 mOsmol/kg and post-deprivation value of 300 mOsmol/kg.

The patient undergoes a desmopressin test, where he receives an intranasal dose of desmopressin acetate at 10 pm. Urine samples are collected at midnight and again at 8 am the next day. The results show that the urine osmolality increased from only 300 to 350 mOsmol/kg overnight.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus
B. Diabetes mellitus
C. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
D. Primary polydipsia
E. Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation suggests uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as the most likely diagnosis since there are no other signs or symptoms suggestive of any other underlying condition such as cranial or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, primary polydipsia, or SIADH. The water deprivation test showed mild evidence of polyuria, while the desmopressin test demonstrated an inadequate response in terms of increasing urine concentration overnight despite receiving an adequate dose which could be due to poor glycemic control leading to impaired renal function.

Question
A 35-year-old G4P3 woman attends the antenatal clinic at 20 weeks gestation for routine screening tests for Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities. Her medical history includes epilepsy, which is well controlled on lamotrigine monotherapy, and depression, for which she takes sertraline daily. She has no family history of genetic disorders or congenital anomalies but expresses concern about the potential impact of her medication use on fetal development and whether any additional tests are required due to her increased maternal age.
Which one of these options represents the most appropriate advice? 

A. Offer non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) only
B. Offer NIPT followed by invasive diagnostic testing if positive
C. Offer combined first trimester screening followed by NIPT if high risk
D. Offer combined first trimester screening followed by invasive diagnostic testing if high risk
E. Advise that no additional tests are required

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Women with epilepsy who take antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have a higher risk of having a child with a congenital anomaly, particularly neural tube defects and orofacial clefts. Combined first trimester screening is recommended in this group of women as it can detect these anomalies. If the result is high-risk, invasive diagnostic testing should be offered.

Question
A 30-year-old G1P0 woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 8 weeks gestation for her booking appointment. She has a history of recurrent miscarriage and wants to know what tests can be done to assess her risk of another miscarriage? Her medical history includes hypothyroidism, which is well controlled on levothyroxine therapy, and she takes folic acid supplements daily.
Which one of these options represents the most appropriate advice? 

A. Offer karyotyping for both partners 
B. Offer thrombophilia screen 
C. Measure serum progesterone levels 
D. Perform transvaginal ultrasound scan 
E. Advise that no additional tests are required

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Recurrent miscarriage is defined as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 24 weeks gestation and affects approximately 1% of couples trying to conceive. The majority of cases are unexplained and no specific cause can be identified despite extensive investigations in many cases. There is limited evidence to support routine investigations in women with recurrent miscarriage without any other significant medical history or symptoms suggestive of an underlying condition such as lupus or diabetes mellitus

Question
A 26-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 24 weeks gestation with a history of previous preterm delivery at 32/40 weeks gestation. She has no other medical problems and is not taking any medications. On examination, her cervix is found to be shortening and funneling on transvaginal ultrasound scan. What is the most appropriate management for this patient? Should she receive cervical cerclage? If so, what type? And when should it be placed? 

A. McDonald cerclage at 28 weeks
B. Shirodkar cerclage at 14-16 weeks
C. Transabdominal cerclage before pregnancy
D. Expectant management with close monitoring
E. Vaginal progesterone

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This question tests knowledge of the management of women with a history of preterm birth who present in their current pregnancy with cervical shortening or funneling on ultrasound scan. The correct answer is vaginal progesterone, which has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent preterm birth in this group of women.

Question
A baby boy born at 30/40 weeks gestation develops respiratory distress shortly after birth and requires intubation and mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). He receives surfactant replacement therapy and his condition improves over the next few days, but he remains ventilator-dependent due to persistent apnea episodes despite caffeine therapy. What is the most likely diagnosis? What further investigations are required? And what treatment options are available?

A. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia; echocardiogram; high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy
B. Patent ductus arteriosus; chest X-ray; ibuprofen prophylaxis 
C. Apnea of prematurity; sleep study; continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 
D. Intraventricular hemorrhage; head ultrasound scan; ventriculoperitoneal shunt
E. Necrotizing enterocolitis; abdominal X-ray; total parenteral nutrition (TPN)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This question tests knowledge of the diagnosis and management of apnea of prematurity, a common problem in premature infants due to immaturity of the respiratory control center in the brainstem. The correct answer is apnea of prematurity, which can be diagnosed with a sleep study and managed with CPAP or other respiratory support measures.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 32 weeks gestation with preterm labor symptoms, including regular contractions and cervical dilation on examination. She receives tocolytic therapy and antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation before being discharged home on bed rest. At 35/40 weeks gestation, she presents again with ruptured membranes and is found to have chorioamnionitis on amniotic fluid analysis. What are the risks associated with prolonged rupture of membranes? How should this patient be managed? And what are the potential complications for both mother and baby?

A. Preterm birth; expectant management; neonatal sepsis
B. Placental abruption; urgent delivery by cesarean section; maternal hemorrhage
C. Fetal distress; induction of labor; neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
D. Postpartum hemorrhage; vaginal delivery if possible; neonatal jaundice
E. Maternal sepsis; immediate delivery by cesarean section under general anesthesia; neonatal respiratory distress syndrome

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This question tests knowledge of the risks and management options for prolonged rupture of membranes in late pregnancy, as well as the potential complications for both mother and baby. The correct answer is maternal sepsis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate delivery by cesarean section under general anesthesia to minimize the risk of vertical transmission of infection to the neonate. Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is also a potential complication due to inadequate fetal lung maturation in cases of chorioamnionitis.

Question
A 16-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhea and no breast development. She has a history of recurrent respiratory infections, and her height is below the 3rd percentile for age. Physical examination reveals widely spaced nipples, webbed neck, and cubitus valgus. Which chromosomal abnormality is most likely to cause her clinical presentation? Additionally, which hormone replacement therapy would be appropriate for this patient? 

A. Turner syndrome; estrogen replacement therapy 
B. Klinefelter syndrome; testosterone replacement therapy
C. Androgen insensitivity syndrome; progesterone replacement therapy
D. Noonan syndrome; growth hormone replacement therapy 
E. Prader-Willi syndrome; gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with Turner Syndrome, which occurs due to complete or partial loss of one X chromosome in females resulting in short stature, delayed puberty, and ovarian failure leading to infertility. Estrogen replacement therapy can help induce puberty and prevent osteoporosis.

Question
A 14-year-old boy presents with gynecomastia and testicular enlargement that started six months ago but has not progressed since then. He reports occasional headaches but denies any visual changes or galactorrhea. His past medical history is unremarkable except for mild asthma controlled on inhaled corticosteroids. On physical examination, he has Tanner stage IV pubic hair development but only Tanner stage II breast development bilaterally without tenderness or discharge.
Which of the following investigations should be ordered? 

A. Serum prolactin level
B. Testosterone level
C. Luteinizing hormone (LH) level
D. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient’s presentation is consistent with pubertal gynecomastia, which is a common and usually self-limited condition. However, the presence of headaches warrants further investigation for possible pituitary adenoma causing hyperprolactinemia. An MRI of the brain can help identify any structural abnormalities.

Question
A 13-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhea and no breast development. She has a history of constipation and abdominal distension since childhood but denies any vomiting or diarrhea. Physical examination reveals a palpable mass in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen that is non-tender and immobile. Her height is below the 3rd percentile for age.
Which of the following investigations should be ordered? 

A. Karyotype
B. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level
C. Transvaginal ultrasound
D. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan 
E. Colonoscopy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient’s clinical presentation suggests Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, which occurs due to congenital absence or hypoplasia of the uterus and upper vagina while ovaries are present and functional leading to primary amenorrhea. Transvaginal ultrasound can confirm this diagnosis by demonstrating absent or rudimentary uterus and normal ovaries. Constipation may be unrelated to her reproductive system anomaly and requires further evaluation separately if needed.

Question
A 25-year-old female patient presents with a purpuric rash on her lower limbs, accompanied by joint pain and abdominal discomfort. She reports having experienced similar symptoms in the past but never sought medical attention. On examination, she has palpable purpura over both legs and buttocks, as well as mild tenderness over her abdomen. Blood tests reveal an elevated ESR and normal platelet count.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Henoch-Schönlein purpura
B. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation 
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus 
E. Polyarteritis nodosa

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), which is characterized by non-thrombocytopenic palpable purpura, arthralgia or arthritis, abdominal pain, and renal involvement in some cases. HSP typically affects children between 2-11 years old but can also occur in adults, particularly young women. It is usually self-limiting and resolves within a few weeks without specific treatment.

Question
A 60-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of petechiae on his arms and legs associated with bleeding gums and epistaxis for the last two days. He has no significant past medical history except for hypertension that he takes medication for regularly.
On examination, there are widespread petechiae on his skin along with ecchymoses around his eyes and mouth.
Blood tests show a low platelet count (<20 x10^9/L) and prolonged PT/INR.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Immune thrombocytopenia
B. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation 
D. Haemophilia A 
E. Acute myeloid leukaemia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is characterized by widespread bleeding and clotting due to abnormal activation of the coagulation system. DIC can be triggered by various underlying conditions such as sepsis, malignancy, trauma, or obstetric complications. In this case, hypertension may have contributed to endothelial damage and platelet consumption leading to DIC.

Question
A 40-year-old female patient presents with a history of recurrent episodes of palpable purpura on her lower limbs for the last two years associated with joint pain and fatigue.
She reports having undergone multiple investigations in the past including skin biopsy that showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis but no specific diagnosis was made.
On examination, she has palpable purpura over both legs and ankles along with mild synovitis in her wrists and knees.
Blood tests reveal an elevated ESR, ANA positivity (1:640) with speckled pattern, negative anti-dsDNA antibodies, normal complement levels, and negative rheumatoid factor.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Systemic lupus erythematosus
B. Rheumatoid arthritis
C. Sjogren's syndrome 
D. Mixed connective tissue disease 
E. Vasculitis associated with hepatitis B/C infection

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation and laboratory findings of this patient are suggestive of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), which is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by features overlapping systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, and polymyositis/dermatomyositis. The presence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, ANA positivity with speckled pattern, and mild synovitis are supportive of MCTD. However, the absence of anti-dsDNA antibodies and normal complement levels distinguishes it from SLE.

Question

Question
A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a painful, red left eye and blurred vision that started suddenly while he was watching television. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but is otherwise healthy. On examination, his visual acuity in the affected eye is reduced to 6/24, and there is marked conjunctival injection with corneal edema and shallow anterior chamber depth. The intraocular pressure (IOP) in the affected eye is elevated at 40 mmHg, whereas the IOP in the unaffected eye is normal at 16 mmHg.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
B. Endophthalmitis
C. Scleritis
D. Uveitis
E. Herpes simplex keratitis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma, which typically presents with sudden onset of severe pain associated with nausea/vomiting, halos around lights, blurred vision, and a red eye with a fixed mid-dilated pupil due to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). It can be precipitated by pupillary dilation or other factors that cause an increase in aqueous humor production or decrease in outflow through the trabecular meshwork.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of a red right eye for two weeks without any discharge or itching sensation; she denies any ocular trauma or contact lens wear. She reports mild discomfort on waking up that improves throughout the day but worsens when reading for prolonged periods.
On examination, there are multiple small dilated blood vessels overlying the sclera of her right eye without any signs of inflammation or discharge; her visual acuity is normal bilaterally.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Episcleritis
B. Scleritis
C. Conjunctivitis
D. Keratitis
E. Uveitis

Correct Answer: A

It can be idiopathic or associated with systemic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a painful left eye for four days; he reports no history of trauma or contact lens wear but admits to using topical steroids prescribed by his friend for a presumed allergic conjunctivitis.
On examination, there is marked injection of the conjunctiva with chemosis and corneal edema in his left eye; visual acuity is reduced to 6/60 due to central corneal ulceration with hypopyon formation and anterior chamber reaction.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Fungal keratitis
B. Bacterial keratitis
C. Herpes simplex keratitis 
D. Acanthamoeba keratitis 
E. Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), which typically occurs in contact lens wearers who use tap water for cleaning their lenses or swimming while wearing them; however, it can also occur in non-contact lens wearers who have had ocular surface trauma or exposure to contaminated water sources such as hot tubs or lakes/rivers during outdoor activities. AK presents as a painful red eye associated with photophobia, tearing, blurred vision, and foreign body sensation that worsens over time despite treatment with antibiotics/steroids due to its resistance to these agents. The diagnosis is confirmed by corneal scraping/culture or confocal microscopy, and treatment involves topical anti-amoebic agents such as polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) or chlorhexidine along with supportive measures such as bandage contact lens and cycloplegics.

Question
A 36-year-old woman presents at 28 weeks’ gestation with a complaint of reduced fetal movements for the past two days. She has no significant medical history and is otherwise well.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents with a hypertrophic scar on his left arm, which he developed after a burn injury. He reports that the scar is painful and itchy. On examination, the scar appears raised, red, and firm to touch. Which of the following options is true regarding hypertrophic scars? 

A. They are more common in females than males
B. They usually develop within 6 months of an injury 
C. They do not extend beyond the margins of the original wound 
D. They have a higher recurrence rate compared to keloids 
E. They respond well to intralesional corticosteroid injections

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Hypertrophic scars are raised, red, and firm scars that remain within the boundaries of the original wound and typically occur within 4-8 weeks after an injury or surgery. They are more common in males than females and have a lower recurrence rate compared to keloids. Treatment options for hypertrophic scars include silicone gel sheets, pressure therapy, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and intralesional corticosteroid injections.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents with multiple keloid scars on her chest and upper back region following acne breakouts during adolescence. She reports that the scars are cosmetically bothersome and sometimes painful when touched or rubbed against clothing. Which one of the following statements about keloids is incorrect? 

A. Keloids can occur at any age but are more common in younger individuals 
B. Keloids may be associated with genetic factors 
C. Keloids tend to grow beyond the margins of the original wound 
D. Keloids have a high recurrence rate even after surgical excision 
E. Keloids rarely cause symptoms such as pain or itching

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Keloids are raised, thickened scars that extend beyond the borders of an initial skin injury due to an overproduction of collagen. They are more common in younger individuals and may have a genetic predisposition. Keloids can cause symptoms such as pain, itching, or tenderness and have a high recurrence rate even after surgical excision. Treatment options include intralesional corticosteroid injections, cryotherapy, laser therapy, pressure therapy, and silicone gel sheets.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents with a non-healing ulcer on his lower leg that has been present for several months. On examination, the wound appears to be shallow with granulation tissue at the base and surrounding erythema. The patient reports that he had a similar ulcer on the same leg several years ago that healed but left behind a hypertrophic scar. Which one of the following statements about chronic wounds is true? 

A. Chronic wounds heal faster than acute wounds 
B. Chronic wounds are usually caused by bacterial infections 
C. Chronic wounds often result in keloid formation 
D. Chronic wounds require debridement before healing can occur 
E. Chronic wounds may lead to excessive scarring due to prolonged inflammation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Chronic wounds are defined as those that fail to progress through the normal stages of healing within 3 months or remain unhealed for longer than expected based on their initial presentation. These types of wounds may result from underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or peripheral vascular disease or from external factors such as trauma or pressure ulcers. Prolonged inflammation associated with chronic wounds may lead to excessive scarring including hypertrophic scars or keloids if not managed appropriately. Treatment options for chronic wounds include debridement, topical dressings, negative pressure wound therapy, and surgical intervention if necessary.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with a severe crush injury to his right hand sustained while operating heavy machinery at work. On examination, there is significant swelling and ecchymosis of the affected hand, which is cold and pulseless. The patient reports numbness and tingling in his fingers. X-rays reveal multiple fractures of the metacarpals and phalanges.
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 
A. Immediate surgical intervention
B. Application of ice packs to reduce swelling
C. Administration of intravenous antibiotics
D. Elevation of the affected limb above heart level
E. Splinting of the affected limb

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation suggests acute compartment syndrome (ACS), which can occur as a result of soft tissue injuries such as crush injuries or fractures that cause increased pressure within an enclosed space, leading to ischemia and necrosis of tissues within that space. ACS is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent irreversible damage; therefore, option A is incorrect as it may delay definitive treatment by necessitating further investigations before surgery can be performed. Option B may provide temporary relief but does not address the underlying problem and may worsen ACS due to vasoconstriction caused by cold exposure. Option C is unnecessary until a diagnosis has been confirmed, whereas elevation (option D) helps decrease venous pressure and improve blood flow, reducing tissue damage until surgical intervention can be performed.

Question
A 28-year-old male athlete presents with pain in his left knee after twisting it during a football match two weeks ago. He describes sharp pain on weight-bearing activities such as running or jumping but no pain at rest or during walking on flat surfaces.
On examination, there is tenderness over the medial joint line with mild effusion present but no instability noted on ligament testing.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 
A. Meniscal tear
B. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury
C. Patellar tendinopathy
D. Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)
E. Medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The history and examination findings suggest a meniscal tear, which commonly occurs in athletes following twisting injuries to the knee joint. Option B is less likely as ACL injuries usually present with instability or giving way rather than pain alone; option C is incorrect as patellar tendinopathy typically presents with anterior knee pain during activities such as jumping or squatting but not necessarily on weight-bearing; option D is unlikely given the absence of mechanical symptoms such as locking or catching; and option E may cause medial joint line tenderness but also results in valgus laxity.

Question
A 42-year-old woman presents with a painful swelling on her right forearm after falling from her bicycle onto an outstretched hand two days ago.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the fertility clinic with her husband after trying to conceive for over two years. Her menstrual cycles are regular, and she has no history of sexually transmitted infections or pelvic inflammatory disease. Her husband's semen analysis is normal. The patient reports a previous ectopic pregnancy that was treated surgically, but no other gynecological issues. On examination, there is tenderness on bimanual palpation and an ultrasound shows bilateral hydrosalpinx.

Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Hysteroscopic polypectomy
B. In vitro fertilization (IVF)
C. Laparoscopic salpingectomy

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the fertility clinic with her husband after trying to conceive for over two years. She has regular menstrual cycles and no history of sexually transmitted infections or pelvic inflammatory disease. Her husband's semen analysis is normal. The patient reports a previous laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis that was treated successfully. An ultrasound shows multiple small follicles in both ovaries consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate? 

A. Clomiphene citrate
B. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist
C. In vitro fertilization (IVF)
D. Metformin 
E. Ovarian drilling

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: PCOS can cause subfertility due to anovulation or irregular ovulation patterns. IVF may be recommended as it bypasses ovulatory dysfunction by stimulating multiple follicles to mature and retrieving them for fertilization in vitro before transferring embryos into the uterus. Other treatments such as clomiphene citrate or metformin may also be considered depending on individual patient factors, but IVF offers higher success rates in cases of severe subfertility due to PCOS.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents at 18 weeks’ gestation for a routine antenatal check-up. The ultrasound scan reveals that the fetus has anencephaly. She is devastated by this news and wants to discuss her options with regards to termination of pregnancy. The clinician explains all the available options, including surgical evacuation of products of conception, medical induction of labor, or continuing with the pregnancy until natural delivery occurs. However, the patient is concerned about the risks associated with each option and wants more information before making a decision.
Which of the following statements regarding the management options for this patient is correct? 

A. Surgical evacuation of products of conception carries a higher risk of infection than medical induction of labor
B. Medical induction of labor can be performed up to 24 weeks' gestation 
C. Continuing with the pregnancy until natural delivery occurs poses no physical risks to the mother 
D. Both surgical evacuation and medical induction carry similar risks of haemorrhage 
E. All three management options carry significant psychological risks

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Although both surgical evacuation and medical induction are safe methods for terminating pregnancies in cases where there is fetal anomaly, they do carry some risks such as haemorrhage, cervical trauma, uterine perforation, and infection. However, studies have shown that surgical evacuation carries a slightly higher risk of infection compared to medical induction.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents at 8 weeks’ gestation requesting termination of her pregnancy due to personal reasons unrelated to fetal anomaly or maternal health issues. After counseling her on all available options, she decides on medical abortion using mifepristone followed by misoprostol at home.
Which one of these statements regarding mifepristone use during early pregnancy is true? 

A. Mifepristone acts as an agonist at progesterone receptors
B. Mifepristone can be used safely up to 12 weeks' gestation
C. Mifepristone is contraindicated in women with a history of ectopic pregnancy 
D. Mifepristone has no effect on the endometrium 
E. Mifepristone use during early pregnancy carries no risk of adverse effects

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Mifepristone acts as an antagonist at progesterone receptors, leading to the breakdown of the endometrium and detachment of the implanted embryo or fetus. It is commonly used for medical abortion up to 9 weeks’ gestation, but it can also be used up to 10-12 weeks’ gestation in some cases. However, mifepristone is contraindicated in women with a history of ectopic pregnancy due to the potential risk of ruptured fallopian tubes.

Question
A 19-year-old woman presents at 14 weeks’ gestation requesting termination of her pregnancy due to financial difficulties and lack of support from her partner. She has never been pregnant before and wants more information about what to expect during and after the procedure.
Which one of these statements regarding surgical termination of pregnancy (TOP) is true? 

A. TOP can only be performed under general anesthesia 
B. The most common method for TOP involves dilation and curettage (D&C)
C. TOP carries a higher risk of complications than medical abortion
D. Women who undergo TOP are usually discharged home within a few hours after the procedure 
E. Follow-up appointments are not necessary after TOP if there are no immediate complications

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Surgical termination of pregnancy can be performed under local or general anesthesia depending on patient preference and clinical circumstances. The most common method for TOP involves dilatation and evacuation (D&E), which involves dilating the cervix and removing the products of conception using suction and/or forceps. TOP is generally considered safe, with a low risk of complications such as infection, haemorrhage, cervical trauma, or uterine perforation. Women who undergo TOP are usually discharged home within a few hours after the procedure and are advised to attend follow-up appointments to monitor their physical and emotional recovery.

Question
A 27-year-old male presents to the emergency department with complaints of painful urination and urethral discharge for the past week.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents to the sexual health clinic complaining of painful ulcers on her vulva that have been present for about a week now; she also reports having noticed some vaginal discharge and mild dysuria recently. She denies any history of sexually transmitted infections but admits to having had unprotected sex with a new partner about two weeks ago while travelling abroad. On examination, there are multiple shallow ulcers on her labia majora and minora that are tender to touch; inguinal lymph nodes are palpable but non-tender bilaterally.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the diagnosis and management of this condition? 

A. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) serology testing should always be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
B. Empirical treatment with doxycycline and metronidazole is appropriate pending test results.
C. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) should be suspected if rectal symptoms are present in addition to genital symptoms.
D. The presence of chancroid ulceration increases the risk of HIV transmission during intercourse.
E. The use of topical corticosteroids is recommended to reduce inflammation and promote healing.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: LGV should be suspected in patients with genital ulcers or proctitis who have a history of sexual contact with individuals from endemic regions or high-risk groups such as men who have sex with men. Serology testing for HSV may not always be reliable, and empirical treatment for chancroid (azithromycin) may be considered if the diagnosis remains uncertain. Topical steroids are contraindicated in infectious causes of vulvar ulceration.

Question
A 75-year-old female presents to the GP with a history of urinary incontinence for the past year.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest mixed incontinence, and as she has no evidence of pelvic organ prolapse or neurological deficits, topical estrogen therapy may be effective in treating her symptoms by improving urethral support and increasing tissue elasticity.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) over the past year. He has been treated with antibiotics multiple times, but the symptoms keep coming back. He also reports having difficulty passing urine and dribbling after urination. On examination, he has an enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination (DRE). His PSA level is within normal limits.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? 

A. Prostate cancer
B. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
C. Bladder cancer
D. Urinary tract infection (UTI) 
E. Chronic kidney disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with BPH, which commonly causes obstructive urinary symptoms such as hesitancy, weak stream, dribbling after urination, and incomplete emptying of the bladder. Recurrent UTIs may also be associated with BPH due to incomplete bladder emptying leading to stagnant urine in the bladder providing a breeding ground for bacteria.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of recurrent episodes of painful urination and lower abdominal pain over the past year. She reports that these symptoms usually occur after sexual intercourse and resolve spontaneously within a few days without treatment. She denies any vaginal discharge or bleeding between periods.
On examination, there are no abnormalities detected apart from mild suprapubic tenderness.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? 

A. Interstitial cystitis
B. Acute pyelonephritis
C. Gonococcal urethritis
D. Chlamydia trachomatis infection 
E. Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, which are common in sexually active women due to their shorter urethra and proximity of the urethral opening to the anus. The symptoms usually occur after sexual intercourse and resolve spontaneously within a few days without treatment. There are no other signs or symptoms suggestive of more serious infections such as pyelonephritis, gonococcal urethritis or chlamydia trachomatis infection.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of painless gross hematuria (blood in urine) for the past week. He has no other urinary symptoms and denies any recent trauma or strenuous exercise. He has a history of smoking for over 30 years but quit smoking 5 years ago.
On examination, there is no palpable abdominal mass or lymphadenopathy. DRE reveals an enlarged prostate gland with smooth surface and no nodules.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Bladder cancer
B. Prostate cancer
C. Renal cell carcinoma
D. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
E. Urinary tract infection (UTI)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Painless gross hematuria in an adult male raises suspicion for bladder cancer until proven otherwise, especially in those with a history of smoking as it is one of the major risk factors for developing bladder cancer. Other possible causes such as UTIs, renal stones, and benign prostatic enlargement should also be considered but can usually be ruled out based on clinical findings and investigations such as urinalysis, imaging studies, and cystoscopy if necessary.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with a one-week history of left breast pain and swelling. She has no significant past medical history, is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and does not take any regular medications. On examination, there is an area of erythema and tenderness in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast. There is also a palpable mass measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter. The patient's temperature is 38°C, blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, and pulse rate is 90 beats per minute.
Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate at this stage? 

A. Ultrasound scan
B. Mammogram
C. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)
D. Core biopsy
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Given the presence of a palpable mass in addition to erythema and tenderness, further investigation for malignancy should be considered. While ultrasound scan may be useful for identifying fluid collections such as abscesses, it may not provide sufficient information about the nature of the mass itself. Mammography may also be limited by tissue inflammation and density changes associated with mastitis or abscess formation. FNAC can provide rapid results but may yield inadequate samples or false-negative results due to sampling error or overlapping features between benign and malignant lesions. In contrast, core biopsy provides larger tissue samples that can be evaluated histologically for definitive diagnosis.

Question
A 26-year-old primiparous woman presents to her GP with complaints of right breast pain and fever on day four postpartum after vaginal delivery without complications under epidural anesthesia.
On examination, there are signs suggestive of mastitis including erythema, warmth, tenderness overlying an indurated area in the lower inner quadrant of her right breast; there are no nipple fissures or discharge. The patient is afebrile at present, but her temperature was 38.5°C earlier in the day.
Which of the following antibiotic regimens would be most appropriate? 

A. Flucloxacillin
B. Co-amoxiclav
C. Cephalexin
D. Doxycycline and metronidazole
E. Azithromycin

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Mastitis is typically caused by bacterial infection, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common pathogen implicated in lactational mastitis; other organisms such as Streptococcus species or anaerobes may also be involved in non-lactational cases. Empirical treatment should cover these likely pathogens while taking into account local resistance patterns and individual factors such as allergies or comorbidities. Flucloxacillin remains the first-line agent for uncomplicated mastitis due to its narrow spectrum, good tissue penetration, and low risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea compared to broader-spectrum agents such as co-amoxiclav or cephalosporins.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of breast abscess formation over the past year despite multiple courses of antibiotics and incision and drainage procedures.
She has no significant medical history apart from obesity (BMI 35 kg/m2) and heavy smoking (20 cigarettes per day). She does not use any hormonal medications or have a family history of breast cancer.
On examination, there are multiple scars overlying areas of induration and erythema in both breasts; there is no palpable mass or nipple discharge.
Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Mammogram
B. Ultrasound scan
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
D. Breast biopsy
E. Serum prolactin level

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Recurrent breast abscesses may be a sign of an underlying malignancy such as inflammatory breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), particularly in non-lactational cases. Risk factors for these conditions include older age, obesity, smoking, and prior radiation exposure. Imaging studies such as mammography or ultrasound may not provide sufficient information about the nature of the lesions or their relationship to adjacent structures; MRI may be more sensitive but is less specific and more expensive. Serum prolactin levels are unlikely to be helpful in this context unless there are additional features suggestive of hyperprolactinemia such as galactorrhea or menstrual irregularities. A breast biopsy can provide definitive diagnosis by obtaining tissue samples for histological examination and culture if necessary.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of ascending cholangitis due to obstruction from choledocholithiasis or acute cholecystitis that has progressed to involve the common bile duct in this patient with recurrent episodes of biliary colic and now presenting with fever, jaundice, and systemic symptoms indicating sepsis. Initial management includes intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting enteric organisms including gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae commonly associated with ascending infections, and supportive care while awaiting further investigations such as a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications such as abscess formation or perforation.

Question
A 56-year-old male with a history of chronic pancreatitis presents to the emergency department with fever, chills, and right upper quadrant pain for the last two days. He has been experiencing recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and steatorrhea over the past few months. On examination, he is febrile with a temperature of 38°C and tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Physical examination reveals jaundice and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory studies are significant for an elevated white cell count, deranged liver function tests, and coagulopathy.
What is the most likely diagnosis? Which imaging modality should be used? What is the best initial management?

A. Acute cholangitis; Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP); Intravenous antibiotics
B. Hepatocellular carcinoma; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Liver transplantation
C. Alcoholic hepatitis; Computed tomography (CT) scan; Corticosteroids
D. Choledocholithiasis; Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC); Cholecystectomy
E. Primary sclerosing cholangitis; Abdominal ultrasound; Ursodeoxycholic acid

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of acute cholangitis due to obstruction from choledocholithiasis or stricture formation secondary to chronic pancreatitis in this patient with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and steatorrhea indicating pancreatic insufficiency that can lead to biliary stasis and stone formation over time. An ERCP can confirm the presence of stones within the common bile duct while also providing therapeutic options such as endoscopic sphincterotomy or stone extraction if feasible. Initial management includes intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting enteric organisms including gram-negative bacteria, and supportive care.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a lump in her left breast that has been gradually increasing in size over the past six months. She reports no pain or discharge from the nipple, but does describe some mild discomfort when lying on her stomach. On examination, there is a firm, non-tender mass measuring approximately 3cm in diameter located in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. An ultrasound confirms the presence of a cystic lesion.

Which of the following is true regarding breast cysts? 

A. Breast cysts are more common in women who have never given birth
B. Cysts are typically painful and tender to touch
C. The majority of breast cysts will require surgical intervention 
D. Aspiration of fluid from a cyst can help confirm its diagnosis 
E. Breast cysts are not associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Aspiration of fluid from a cyst can be used both for diagnostic purposes (to confirm whether it is indeed a cyst) and therapeutic purposes (to relieve symptoms). Breast cysts are actually more common in women who have given birth, and they are typically not painful unless they become large enough to cause pressure on surrounding tissue. Most breast cysts do not require surgery and are managed conservatively.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with concerns about changes she has noticed in her right breast over the past few weeks. She describes feeling lumps under the skin that seem to move around when touched, as well as some tenderness and swelling in the affected area. Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 50, which has made her particularly anxious about any changes she notices.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Fibroadenoma 
B. Intraductal papilloma 
C. Phyllodes tumor 
D. Fat necrosis 
E. Inflammatory breast cancer 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that often present as a painless, mobile lump in the breast tissue. They are most commonly found in women under 40 and can be diagnosed with imaging studies such as ultrasound or mammography. While they do not increase the risk of developing breast cancer, having a family history of the disease may warrant closer monitoring.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents to her GP with concerns about a lump she has noticed in her left breast over the past month. She reports no other symptoms but is worried because her sister was recently diagnosed with breast cancer at age 48. On examination, there is a firm, non-tender mass measuring approximately 2cm in diameter located in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast.

What is the next most appropriate step? 

A. Order a mammogram and ultrasound 
B. Refer for genetic counseling and testing 
C. Perform fine-needle aspiration biopsy 
D. Recommend watchful waiting and follow-up in six months 
E. Schedule surgical excision of the mass 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of a palpable mass warrants further investigation with imaging studies such as mammography and/or ultrasound to determine whether it appears suspicious for malignancy or requires further diagnostic workup (such as biopsy). Referral for genetic counseling/testing may also be considered given the patient's family history, but this would not necessarily be the first step in management without additional information about her personal risk factors.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with chest pain that started while he was resting at home. He describes it as a squeezing sensation in his chest that radiates to his left arm and jaw. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and a previous myocardial infarction (MI) six years ago. On examination, there are no signs of heart failure or cardiogenic shock. An ECG shows ST-segment depression in leads V1-V4 and T-wave inversion in leads I, II, III, aVF and V5-V6.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Administer fibrinolytic therapy
B. Perform an immediate invasive coronary angiogram 
C. Initiate dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel 
D. Admit the patient for observation and repeat troponin measurement after 6 hours 
E. Discharge the patient with outpatient cardiology follow-up

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe pain in his left eye associated with nausea and vomiting. He has no significant past medical history, but he reports that his father had glaucoma. On examination, his left eye appears red, and there is corneal oedema with a mid-dilated pupil that is unresponsive to light. Intraocular pressure measurement reveals elevated pressure in the affected eye.

Which of the following medications should be avoided in this patient? 

A. Timolol
B. Pilocarpine
C. Brimonidine
D. Latanoprost
E. Acetazolamide

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Pilocarpine can cause pupillary constriction leading to further narrowing of the angle and worsening of symptoms in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her optometrist for routine screening and is found to have raised intraocular pressure (IOP) bilaterally without any other ocular findings or symptoms suggestive of acute glaucoma.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Refer urgently for specialist assessment.
B. Repeat IOP measurement after one week.
C. Prescribe topical timolol drops.
D. Perform visual field testing.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a painful and swollen left elbow that has been worsening over the past week. He reports no history of trauma or injury to the area, but he is an avid tennis player who plays several times a week. On examination, there is tenderness over the lateral epicondyle and pain on resisted wrist extension. An ultrasound confirms the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis with associated bursitis.

Which one of the following treatment options would be most appropriate for this patient?

A. Oral prednisolone
B. Platelet-rich plasma injection
C. Surgical excision of the affected bursa
D. Physical therapy with eccentric exercises
E. Topical capsaicin cream

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, is often accompanied by inflammation of the adjacent bursa, leading to bursitis. Treatment typically involves rest from aggravating activities, ice application, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy with eccentric exercises targeting the extensor muscles of the forearm.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents to her general practitioner with complaints of pain in her right hip that has been ongoing for several months and has worsened recently despite conservative management measures such as rest and analgesics. She denies any recent trauma or falls but does report a history of osteoarthritis in both hips for which she takes regular NSAIDs.
On examination, there is tenderness overlying the greater trochanter on palpation and passive range-of-motion testing elicits pain at end-range abduction and external rotation.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Hip fracture 
B. Septic arthritis 
C. Gluteus medius tendon tear 
D. Osteoarthritis 
E.Trochanteric bursitis 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Trochanteric bursitis is a common cause of lateral hip pain in middle-aged and elderly patients, particularly women. It is often associated with underlying osteoarthritis or repetitive overuse injuries such as running or cycling. Diagnosis can be confirmed by tenderness on palpation over the greater trochanter and reproduction of pain with passive range-of-motion testing.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to his general practitioner with complaints of persistent pain and swelling in his left knee that has been ongoing for several weeks. He reports no history of trauma or injury but does report a recent episode of gastroenteritis that resolved spontaneously.
On examination, there is diffuse swelling and warmth around the knee joint with limited active and passive range-of-motion due to pain. Laboratory investigations reveal an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Gouty arthritis 
B. Rheumatoid arthritis 
C. Septic arthritis 
D. Osteoarthritis 
E.Prepatellar bursitis 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Septic arthritis should always be considered in any patient presenting with acute-onset joint pain, particularly if accompanied by fever, chills, or systemic symptoms such as malaise or fatigue. Risk factors include recent infection, immunosuppression, intravenous drug use, or prior joint surgery. Diagnosis requires prompt synovial fluid analysis via arthrocentesis to confirm the presence of bacteria and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain radiating to his back, nausea, and vomiting. He has a history of heavy alcohol consumption for the last 20 years. On examination, he is tachycardic and hypotensive. Blood tests reveal elevated amylase and lipase levels, as well as deranged liver function tests. An ultrasound shows gallstones but no evidence of biliary obstruction or cholecystitis.

What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? 

A. Acute cholecystitis
B. Acute pancreatitis 
C. Alcoholic hepatitis 
D. Gallstone pancreatitis 
E. Pancreatic cancer

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation of acute pancreatitis can be similar to that of other conditions such as acute cholecystitis or alcoholic hepatitis; however, given the history of heavy alcohol consumption and presence of gallstones on imaging, gallstone pancreatitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Question
A 40-year-old woman presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to her back, nausea, and vomiting for two days. She has a past medical history significant for hypertriglyceridemia and poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus. On examination, she appears uncomfortable with tenderness over her epigastrium.

Which one of the following laboratory findings would support a diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis? 

A. Elevated serum calcium level 
B. Elevated serum creatinine level 
C. Elevated serum potassium level 
D. Elevated serum triglyceride level 
E. Low serum albumin level

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis is a known complication in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and/or hyperlipidemia (especially elevated triglycerides). In this case, an elevated serum triglyceride level would support a diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the last 24 hours. He has a history of heavy alcohol consumption for the last 30 years. On examination, he is tachycardic and hypotensive. Blood tests reveal elevated amylase and lipase levels, as well as deranged liver function tests. An ultrasound shows no evidence of gallstones or biliary obstruction.

What is the most appropriate initial management step in this patient? 

A. Administer intravenous antibiotics 
B. Begin enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube 
C. Initiate corticosteroid therapy 
D. Provide supportive care including IV fluids and analgesia 
E. Transfer to an intensive care unit

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The initial management of acute pancreatitis involves providing supportive care including IV fluids and analgesia to manage pain and prevent dehydration/hypovolemia due to fluid loss from vomiting/diarrhea. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of infection (e.g., infected pancreatic necrosis). Enteral nutrition may be initiated after resolution of symptoms but should not be started during the acute phase of illness when bowel rest is recommended. Corticosteroids have no role in the treatment of acute pancreatitis except in cases of autoimmune pancreatitis (which is rare). ICU transfer may be necessary if the patient develops complications such as respiratory failure or organ dysfunction/failure.

Question

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking presents to the emergency department with chest pain radiating to his left arm. He is diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and taken for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). During the procedure, he develops ventricular fibrillation (VF) and goes into cardiac arrest.

What is the most appropriate initial management of VF in this patient? What medications should be administered? How many defibrillatory shocks are recommended? Should advanced airway management be performed? What is the recommended target temperature range for therapeutic hypothermia post-cardiac arrest?

A. Administer amiodarone and epinephrine; perform up to three defibrillatory shocks; intubate the patient; target temperature range of 32-34°C
B. Administer lidocaine and dopamine; perform up to five defibrillatory shocks; avoid advanced airway management; target temperature range of 35-37°C
C. Administer atropine and norepinephrine; perform up to seven defibrillatory shocks; use supraglottic airway device instead of endotracheal tube; target temperature range of 38-40°C
D. Administer magnesium sulfate and dobutamine; perform up to nine defibrillatory shocks; avoid any form of airway management until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); no need for therapeutic hypothermia in this case
E. Administer vasopressin and phenylephrine; perform unlimited number of defibrillatory shocks until ROSC achieved or deemed futile by medical team without limit on attempts or duration between them; only consider advanced airway management if resuscitation efforts continue beyond 10 minutes after onset of cardiac arrest due to refractory VF/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT); target temperature range of 30-32°C

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: VF is a shockable rhythm and requires immediate defibrillation. The initial management of VF in this patient should include administering amiodarone and epinephrine, performing up to three defibrillatory shocks, intubating the patient, and targeting a temperature range of 32-34°C for therapeutic hypothermia post-cardiac arrest.

Question
A 60-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. She is diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and started on anticoagulation therapy. While being monitored on telemetry, she suddenly develops pulseless electrical activity (PEA).

What are the most common causes of PEA? What is the recommended treatment algorithm for PEA? Should advanced airway management be performed? How long should resuscitation efforts continue before considering termination? What is the role of vasopressin in PEA?

A. Hypovolemia, hypoxia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hyper/hypokalemia, hypoglycemia; administer epinephrine every 3-5 minutes while identifying reversible causes; perform endotracheal intubation as soon as possible; terminate resuscitation after 20 minutes if no ROSC achieved; vasopressin can replace or supplement epinephrine
B. Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia; administer atropine followed by dopamine infusion if no response; avoid any form of airway management until ROSC achieved due to high risk of aspiration during CPR; terminate resuscitation after 10 minutes if no ROSC achieved; vasopressin is not recommended in PEA
C. Hypoxia, hypovolemia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hyper/hypokalemia, hypothermia; administer epinephrine every 5-10 minutes while identifying reversible causes; use supraglottic airway device instead of endotracheal tube to minimize interruptions during CPR; terminate resuscitation after 30 minutes if no ROSC achieved; vasopressin can replace or supplement epinephrine
D. Hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia; administer norepinephrine infusion followed by amiodarone bolus and drip if no response; perform cricothyroidotomy as soon as possible due to high risk of failed intubation attempts during CPR; terminate resuscitation after 15 minutes if no ROSC achieved; vasopressin should be used only as a last resort in refractory cases
E. Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypermagnesemia, hypercalcemia; administer dopamine infusion followed by atropine if bradycardic component present; avoid any form of airway management until ROSC achieved due to high risk of aspiration during CPR and focus on optimizing chest compressions quality and rate instead; terminate resuscitation after 25 minutes if no ROSC achieved; vasopressin can be used as an alternative to epinephrine

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The most common causes of PEA are the "Hs" and "Ts": hypovolemia, hypoxia, hydrogen ion (acidosis), hypo/hyperkalemia/hypoglycemia/hypocalcemia/magnesemia/sodium levels. The recommended treatment algorithm for PEA includes administering epinephrine every 3-5 minutes while identifying reversible causes, performing endotracheal intubation as soon as possible, and targeting a temperature range of 32-34°C for therapeutic hypothermia post-cardiac arrest. Resuscitation efforts should continue for at least 20 minutes before considering termination. Vasopressin can replace or supplement epinephrine in PEA.

Question
A 70-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and heart failure presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath and chest pain. He is diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and started on diuretics and vasodilators. While being monitored on telemetry, he suddenly develops ventricular tachycardia (VT).

What are the most common causes of VT? What is the recommended treatment algorithm for stable VT? Should advanced airway management be performed? How long should resuscitation efforts continue before considering termination? What is the role of amiodarone in VT?

A. Ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte imbalances, drug toxicity; administer synchronized cardioversion if unstable or procainamide infusion if stable; perform endotracheal intubation only if necessary due to high risk of complications during CPR; terminate resuscitation after 30 minutes if no ROSC achieved; amiodarone can be used as an alternative to procainamide
B. Hypertension, valvular heart disease, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis; administer adenosine followed by verapamil or diltiazem infusion if no response; avoid any form of airway management until ROSC achieved due to high risk of aspiration during CPR; terminate resuscitation after 15 minutes if no ROSC achieved; amiodarone should not be used in this case
C. Congenital heart disease, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome; administer amiodarone bolus followed by drip if no response or lidocaine if contraindicated; use supraglottic airway device instead of endotracheal tube to minimize interruptions during CPR; terminate resuscitation after 20 minutes if no ROSC achieved; amiodarone is the drug of choice in VT
D. Aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pericarditis; administer magnesium sulfate infusion followed by beta-blocker therapy if stable or electrical cardioversion if unstable; perform cricothyroidotomy as soon as possible due to high risk of failed intubation attempts during CPR; terminate resuscitation after 10 minutes if no ROSC achieved; amiodarone should be used only as a last resort in refractory cases
E. Pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis; administer epinephrine infusion followed by defibrillation shock every 2-3 minutes until conversion or deemed futile by medical team without limit on attempts or duration between them; only consider advanced airway management if resuscitation efforts continue beyond 5 minutes after onset of cardiac arrest due to refractory VT/pulseless VF; terminate resuscitation after 45 minutes if no ROSC achieved; amiodarone can replace or supplement epinephrine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The most common causes of VT are ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy. The recommended treatment algorithm for stable VT includes administering amiodarone bolus followed by drip if no response or lidocaine if contraindicated. Advanced airway management should be performed using a supraglottic airway device instead of an endotracheal tube to minimize interruptions during CPR. Resuscitation efforts should continue for at least 20 minutes before considering termination. Amiodarone is the drug of choice in VT.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with a history of increasing breathlessness on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea over the past few months. He has a background of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, he has bilateral basal crepitations, raised jugular venous pressure and pitting ankle oedema. His ECG shows sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and strain pattern. An echocardiogram reveals severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%. Blood tests show elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.

Which one of the following is most likely to be responsible for this patient's heart failure? 

A. Ischaemic heart disease
B. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
C. Dilated cardiomyopathy
D. Restrictive cardiomyopathy
E. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's history suggests chronic heart failure with features suggestive of fluid overload such as orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea along with physical signs including raised JVP, basal crepitations and peripheral oedema consistent with left-sided heart failure. The ECG findings suggest left ventricular hypertrophy which can occur in response to long-standing hypertension or ischemic heart disease leading to myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease (CAD). The reduced ejection fraction seen on echocardiography indicates significant systolic dysfunction which is commonly associated with ischemic heart disease.

Question
A 60-year-old male smoker presents to his GP complaining of worsening cough, shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue over the past year along with a recent onset of palpitations at rest. Examination reveals bibasal crackles, tachycardia, and a raised jugular venous pressure. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Chest x-ray reveals cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion. Blood tests show elevated levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
B. Pulmonary fibrosis
C. Acute coronary syndrome
D. Dilated cardiomyopathy
E. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history suggests chronic heart failure with features suggestive of fluid overload such as cough, shortness of breath on exertion along with physical signs including bibasal crackles, tachycardia, raised JVP consistent with left-sided heart failure and palpitations at rest indicating possible atrial fibrillation which can occur in patients with underlying cardiac pathology like dilated cardiomyopathy leading to systolic dysfunction and impaired contractility. Elevated BNP levels suggest myocardial stretch or damage while elevated troponin levels may indicate ischemic injury or necrosis.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of increasing fatigue, dyspnoea on exertion and ankle swelling over the past few months along with occasional episodes of chest pain radiating to her left arm during exercise. She has no significant medical history but reports a family history of sudden cardiac death in her father at age 50 years old.

On examination, she has pitting oedema up to mid-calf bilaterally and normal blood pressure readings in both arms but a difference in radial pulses between them.
An ECG shows sinus rhythm with T-wave inversion in leads V1-V4 while an echocardiogram reveals asymmetric septal hypertrophy with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve leaflet causing dynamic LVOT obstruction.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
B. Dilated cardiomyopathy
C. Restrictive cardiomyopathy
D. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
E. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's history suggests chronic heart failure with features suggestive of fluid overload such as dyspnoea on exertion and ankle swelling along with chest pain radiating to her left arm during exercise indicating possible ischemic injury or angina pectoris which can occur in patients with underlying cardiac pathology like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leading to diastolic dysfunction and impaired relaxation due to asymmetric septal hypertrophy causing dynamic LVOT obstruction resulting in SAM of the mitral valve leaflet. The family history of sudden cardiac death may suggest a genetic predisposition for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy which has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

Question
A 45-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia has been prescribed atorvastatin for the management of her cholesterol levels. After two weeks, she reports experiencing muscle pain and weakness in her legs.

Which of the following is the most likely adverse effect of atorvastatin that could be causing these symptoms? 

A. Nephrotoxicity
B. Diarrhoea
C. Oligomenorrhoea 
D. Medication-induced phaeochromocytoma 
E. Rhabdomyolysis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Atorvastatin is known to cause rhabdomyolysis, which is characterized by muscle pain and weakness, as well as dark urine due to myoglobinuria. This condition can lead to kidney damage or failure if not promptly treated.

Question
A 60-year-old male patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath and chest tightness after starting a new medication for his hypertension.

Which of the following medications is most likely responsible for this adverse drug reaction? 

A. Amlodipine 
B. Lisinopril 
C. Metoprolol 
D. Losartan 
E. Spironolactone 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Beta-blockers such as metoprolol are contraindicated in patients with COPD due to their potential bronchoconstrictive effects, which can worsen respiratory symptoms.

Question

D. Stevens-Johnson syndrome
E. Injection-site reaction 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Carbamazepine is known to cause severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which can be life-threatening. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any signs of a rash or blistering while taking this medication.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents to the ophthalmology clinic with complaints of progressive loss of vision in both eyes over the past year. She reports difficulty reading, driving and recognizing faces. On examination, she has bilateral cataracts with a visual acuity of 6/60 in each eye. The patient is keen on undergoing surgery but expresses concerns about potential complications.

Which one of the following intraocular lens (IOL) options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Multifocal IOL
B. Accommodating IOL
C. Toric IOL
D. Monofocal IOL set for distance vision only
E. Monofocal IOL set for near vision only

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Given that the patient has significant bilateral cataracts and reduced visual acuity, monofocal IOLs are generally recommended as they provide good uncorrected distance vision postoperatively. While multifocal and accommodating lenses can improve near vision, they may cause unwanted glare or halos at night which could affect driving safety.

Question
A 72-year-old man presents to his optometrist with complaints of blurred vision in his left eye over the past few months, despite wearing glasses prescribed by his GP six months ago. He denies any pain or redness in either eye but reports occasional floaters in his left eye.
On examination, he has a best-corrected visual acuity of 6/9 in his right eye and 6/36 in his left eye due to a dense nuclear sclerotic cataract.

What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's cataract? 

A. Long-term corticosteroid use 
B. Diabetes mellitus 
C. Trauma 
D. Smoking history 
E. Age-related changes

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Age-related changes are the most common cause of cataracts, with the majority of cases occurring in individuals over 60 years old. While other factors such as diabetes and corticosteroid use can contribute to cataract formation, they are less likely to be the sole cause in this patient.

Question
A 58-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of worsening vision in both eyes over the past year. She reports difficulty reading small print and driving at night due to glare from oncoming headlights. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but is otherwise healthy.
On examination, she has bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts with a visual acuity of 6/24 in each eye.

Which one of the following surgical techniques would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) 
B. Phacoemulsification 
C. Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) 
D. Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)
E. Refractive lens exchange

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Phacoemulsification is currently the most commonly used technique for cataract surgery due to its minimally invasive nature and rapid postoperative recovery time compared to ECCE or ICCE which require larger incisions and longer healing times. LASIK and refractive lens exchange are not indicated for patients with significant cataracts as they do not address the underlying issue causing reduced visual acuity.

Question
A 38-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and confusion. He has a history of alcohol abuse and reports drinking heavily for the past week. On examination, he is jaundiced and has tender hepatomegaly. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin and INR consistent with acute alcoholic hepatitis.

Question
A 45-year-old female with a history of lymphedema presents to the emergency department with a rapidly spreading cellulitis on her left leg. She has been treated for multiple episodes of cellulitis in the past and is currently taking diuretics for her lymphedema. On examination, there are erythematous streaks extending from the ankle up to the knee, along with tenderness and warmth over the affected area. The patient is febrile and tachycardic.

What would be your initial management plan? 

A. Start IV antibiotics empirically
B. Perform an ultrasound to rule out deep vein thrombosis 
C. Administer intravenous immunoglobulin therapy
D. Obtain blood cultures before starting antibiotics
E. Admit the patient for observation without any intervention

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Blood cultures should be obtained prior to initiating antibiotic therapy as this can help guide appropriate antibiotic selection based on culture results.


Question
A 65-year-old male presents with fever, chills, and pain in his right foot that has progressively worsened over several days despite oral antibiotics prescribed by his GP for suspected cellulitis. He reports no significant medical history but admits to being a heavy smoker.

On examination, he appears unwell with a temperature of 39°C and tachycardia at 110 bpm. There is diffuse swelling and erythema involving the entire right foot, which is tender to touch.

Which of the following investigations would you order? 

A. CT scan of the foot
B. MRI of the foot
C. X-ray of the foot
D. Ultrasound Doppler study of lower limb vessels 
E. Bone scan

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: MRI is considered superior to other imaging modalities when evaluating soft tissue infections such as cellulitis because it provides better visualization of soft tissues including muscles and fascial planes.


Question
A 55-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presents to the emergency department with cellulitis involving her left hand and forearm. She has been on immunosuppressive therapy for several years, including methotrexate and prednisone.

On examination, there is erythema, warmth, tenderness, and swelling over the affected area. There are no signs of abscess formation or lymphangitis.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema for the past year. She reports that her symptoms are worse during times of stress and after consuming certain foods, including shellfish and peanuts. Her physical examination is unremarkable except for diffuse erythematous wheals on her trunk and extremities.

Which of the following tests would be most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis?

A. Skin prick test
B. Serum tryptase level
C. Patch testing
D. Basophil activation test
E. Oral food challenge

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with possible food-induced exacerbations. While skin prick testing or serum-specific IgE levels may be useful in diagnosing acute allergic reactions, they have limited utility in CSU as many patients do not have identifiable triggers on testing. Patch testing is used to diagnose contact dermatitis rather than urticaria, while oral food challenges are reserved for suspected IgE-mediated food allergies. In contrast, basophil activation testing has been shown to be a sensitive and specific tool for identifying underlying autoimmune mechanisms in CSU.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a history of persistent cough and dyspnea on exertion for the past six months despite treatment with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. He reports no significant medical history but notes that his symptoms worsen when he spends time outdoors or around animals.

What investigation should be performed next?

A. Chest x-ray
B. High-resolution CT scan of chest
C. Pulmonary function tests
D. Bronchoscopy with biopsy
E. Methacholine challenge test

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of asthma exacerbated by environmental triggers such as allergens or irritants; however, given the lack of response to standard therapy, further investigation is warranted. While chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests may be useful in diagnosing asthma, they are unlikely to provide additional information beyond what has already been obtained with bronchodilator and steroid trials. Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be indicated if malignancy or infection is suspected but is not a first-line investigation for asthma. In contrast, high-resolution CT scan of the chest can identify structural abnormalities such as bronchiectasis or interstitial lung disease that may contribute to persistent symptoms.

Question
A 27-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent episodes of anaphylaxis over the past year. She reports that her symptoms occur within minutes of exposure to certain foods, including peanuts and shellfish, as well as during exercise or times of stress. She carries an epinephrine auto-injector but notes that it does not always relieve her symptoms completely.

Which of the following would be most appropriate next step in management?

A. Referral for allergen immunotherapy
B. Addition of omalizumab to current treatment regimen
C. Switching from subcutaneous to intramuscular epinephrine administration
D. Evaluation for underlying mast cell disorder
E. Avoidance of all potential triggers

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of severe allergic reactions consistent with anaphylaxis; however, given the frequency and severity of her symptoms despite appropriate use of epinephrine, further evaluation for underlying mast cell disorders such as systemic mastocytosis should be considered. Allergen immunotherapy may be beneficial in patients with IgE-mediated allergies but is not indicated in non-IgE mediated reactions such as those seen in mast cell disorders. Omalizumab is used primarily in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who have failed other therapies and has limited utility in treating anaphylaxis. Switching from subcutaneous to intramuscular epinephrine administration is unlikely to improve symptom control, while complete avoidance of all potential triggers may be impractical and limit the patient's quality of life.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with sudden painless loss of vision in his right eye. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes medication. On examination, there is no relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), but the patient describes seeing a "curtain" descending over his field of vision before losing sight completely. Fundoscopy shows pale retina with cherry-red spot at the macula.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Central retinal artery occlusion
B. Central retinal vein occlusion
C. Ischemic optic neuropathy
D. Retinal detachment 
E. Optic neuritis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presentation is consistent with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). The presence of cherry-red spot at the macula indicates ischemia to the inner retina while sparing the fovea due to its unique blood supply from choroidal circulation.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with sudden painless loss of vision in her left eye that started as a dark shadow on one side and progressed centrally within minutes. She has no significant past medical history except for migraine headaches, which she treats with ibuprofen occasionally.

On examination, visual acuity in her left eye is hand motion only, and fundoscopy reveals diffuse retinal whitening without any cherry-red spot or emboli seen.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Central retinal artery occlusion
B. Central retinal vein occlusion
C. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
D. Migraine aura without headache
E. Optic nerve compression

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical features are suggestive of migraine aura without headache, also known as ophthalmic migraine or acephalgic migraine, which can present with transient monocular blindness lasting up to an hour. The retinal whitening seen on fundoscopy is likely due to vasospasm of the retinal vessels.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with sudden painless loss of vision in his right eye that started as a dark shadow and progressed centrally within minutes. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he takes warfarin regularly. On examination, visual acuity in his right eye is hand motion only, and fundoscopy reveals diffuse retinal whitening with a "boxcarring" appearance of the arterioles.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Central retinal artery occlusion
B. Central retinal vein occlusion
C. Ischemic optic neuropathy
D. Retinal detachment 
E. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features are consistent with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), which can occur in patients with cardiovascular risk factors such as atrial fibrillation or hypertension. The "boxcarring" appearance of the arterioles refers to segmental narrowing and dilation seen on ophthalmoscopy due to ischemia-induced damage to vascular endothelium.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue, shortness of breath and dizziness. He has a past medical history of Crohn's disease and has been on long-term steroid therapy for the same. On examination, he is pale and tachycardic with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Laboratory investigations reveal a haemoglobin level of 80 g/L, MCV of 70 fL, serum iron levels are low while ferritin levels are elevated. What is the most likely cause of his anaemia? 

A. Iron deficiency
B. Anaemia of chronic disease
C. Vitamin B12 deficiency 
D. Folate deficiency 
E. Thalassaemia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) which can occur in patients with inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease who have been on long-term steroid therapy. The laboratory findings show normal or decreased iron stores but elevated ferritin levels due to increased storage in macrophages from inflammation.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents to her GP complaining of fatigue and weakness for the past few months along with occasional palpitations and shortness of breath on exertion. She denies any recent bleeding episodes or significant weight loss but reports having had heavy menstrual periods for several years now that have become more frequent recently. Her physical examination reveals pallor and conjunctival pallor without any other significant findings. Laboratory investigations reveal a haemoglobin level of 85 g/L, MCV of 65 fL, serum iron levels are low while TIBC (total iron-binding capacity) is high and transferrin saturation is low as well.
What is the most likely cause of her anaemia? 

A. Iron deficiency
B. Anaemia of chronic disease
C. Haemolytic anaemia
D. Aplastic anaemia 
E. Myelodysplastic syndrome

Correct Answer: A 

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) which can occur due to chronic blood loss from heavy menstrual periods in women of reproductive age. The laboratory findings show decreased haemoglobin and MCV levels along with low serum iron levels, high TIBC and low transferrin saturation.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue, shortness of breath and palpitations for the past few weeks. He denies any significant medical history or recent bleeding episodes but reports having a vegetarian diet for the past year. On examination, he is pale and tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute. Laboratory investigations reveal a haemoglobin level of 70 g/L, MCV of 65 fL, serum ferritin levels are normal while vitamin B12 levels are low.
What is the most likely cause of his anaemia? 

A. Iron deficiency
B. Anaemia of chronic disease
C. Vitamin B12 deficiency 
D. Folate deficiency 
E. Thalassaemia

Correct Answer: C 

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia which can occur due to inadequate dietary intake especially in vegetarians who do not consume animal products rich in vitamin B12 such as meat, fish or dairy products. The laboratory findings show decreased haemoglobin and MCV levels along with low vitamin B12 levels while ferritin levels remain normal since it reflects iron stores only and not vitamin B12 status.

Question
A 5-year-old girl with a history of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) presents to the clinic with her parents. They report that she has been experiencing difficulty with fine motor skills, such as buttoning clothes and using utensils during meals.

Which area of the brain is most likely affected? 

A. Basal ganglia 
B. Cerebellum 
C. Thalamus 
D. Hippocampus 
E. Prefrontal cortex

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Poor head control suggests cerebellar involvement as it plays an important role in balance and coordination.

Question
A 7-year-old girl with cerebral palsy presents to the clinic for a follow-up appointment. She was diagnosed with spastic diplegia at age 2 and has been receiving physiotherapy regularly since then. Her parents report that she is able to walk independently but experiences frequent falls, especially when walking on uneven surfaces.

On examination, there is evidence of increased muscle tone in both legs, with hyperreflexia noted on testing knee and ankle jerks. The child's gait is stiff-legged and scissoring, with her feet turned inward.

What type of treatment would be most appropriate? 

A. Botulinum toxin injections 
B. Baclofen therapy 
C. Selective dorsal rhizotomy 
D. Intrathecal baclofen pump 
E. Serial casting

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Selective dorsal rhizotomy involves cutting specific sensory nerve fibers in the spinal cord to reduce spasticity and improve mobility in patients with spastic diplegia, making it the most appropriate treatment option for this patient's presentation.

Question
A 30-year-old male presents to the clinic with complaints of low back pain and stiffness for more than a year. He reports that his symptoms are worse in the morning and after periods of inactivity, but improve with exercise. The patient has been taking NSAIDs regularly which have provided some relief. On examination, there is reduced forward flexion and positive Schober’s test. An MRI scan confirms changes consistent with ankylosing spondylitis.

Which of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate to assess disease activity in this patient? 

A. X-ray
B. CT scan
C. Ultrasound
D. PET-CT scan
E. MRI

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: While x-rays may show structural damage, they do not provide information on disease activity or inflammation levels in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). CT scans are useful for identifying bony erosions and fractures but cannot detect early inflammatory changes seen in AS. Ultrasound can identify soft tissue inflammation but is less sensitive at detecting bone changes compared to MRI scans. PET-CT scans are used to detect cancerous cells and are not routinely used in the diagnosis or management of AS. Therefore, MRI is considered the most appropriate imaging modality for assessing disease activity in patients with AS.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the GP with complaints of lower back pain and stiffness that has been present for several months now. She reports that her symptoms are worse in the morning and after periods of rest, but improve throughout the day with movement and exercise. Her medical history is unremarkable except for occasional headaches managed by over-the-counter analgesics.

On examination, there is limited lumbar spine mobility with positive Schober's test results noted as well as tenderness over sacroiliac joints bilaterally.
Which of the following tests would be most helpful in confirming a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis? 

A. HLA-B27 testing
B. C-reactive protein (CRP) level
C. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
D. Rheumatoid factor (RF) testing
E. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Ankylosing spondylitis is strongly associated with the presence of HLA-B27 antigen, which can be detected through a blood test. While CRP and ESR levels may be elevated in patients with AS, they are not specific to this condition and can also be seen in other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or infection. RF and ANA tests are used to diagnose other autoimmune diseases but are not helpful in diagnosing AS.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents to the clinic with complaints of low back pain and stiffness for more than 2 years now. He reports that his symptoms have been progressively worsening despite taking NSAIDs regularly, which provide only partial relief.
On examination, there is reduced lumbar spine mobility with positive Schober’s test results noted as well as tenderness over sacroiliac joints bilaterally.
Which of the following medications would be most appropriate for treating this patient? 

A. Prednisolone
B. Sulfasalazine 
C. Methotrexate
D. Etanercept 
E. Adalimumab

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Biologic agents such as etanercept and adalimumab are considered first-line treatments for ankylosing spondylitis when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) fail to control symptoms adequately or if there is evidence of spinal inflammation on imaging studies despite treatment with NSAIDs alone. Prednisolone, sulfasalazine, and methotrexate have limited efficacy in treating AS and are not considered first-line therapies.

Question
A 32-year-old male presents with urethral discharge and dysuria. He reports having unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the past few months. On examination, there is a purulent discharge from the urethra, and no other abnormalities are noted.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) shows an infection with Chlamydia trachomatis.

What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient? Consider his medical history of severe penicillin allergy.

A. Ceftriaxone
B. Azithromycin
C. Gentamicin
D. Levofloxacin
E. Vancomycin

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of chlamydial infection, which requires antibiotic therapy to prevent complications such as epididymitis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). However, due to his severe penicillin allergy, options like amoxicillin or ceftriaxone are not suitable choices for him. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that can be used in patients allergic to penicillins and macrolides like azithromycin. Therefore, levofloxacin is the most appropriate choice for this patient.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents with lower abdominal pain and vaginal discharge for three days duration. She reports having unprotected sex with her new partner two weeks ago and has been experiencing these symptoms since then.

On examination, she has cervical motion tenderness and bilateral adnexal tenderness on bimanual examination.

The laboratory test results show positive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections.

What is the most appropriate management plan? 

A. Treat only N.gonorrhoeae infection 
B. Treat only C.trachomatis infection 
C. Treat both N.gonorrhoeae and C.trachomatis infections with azithromycin and ceftriaxone
D. Treat both N.gonorrhoeae and C.trachomatis infections with doxycycline and metronidazole
E. Refer to gynecologist for further management

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient has symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is a serious complication of untreated sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia. Therefore, prompt treatment is necessary to prevent complications such as infertility or ectopic pregnancy. In this case, the patient has positive results for both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections, so she should be treated with dual therapy consisting of intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents with urethral discharge, dysuria, and testicular pain for two days duration. He reports having unprotected sex with multiple partners in the past few weeks.

On examination, there is a purulent discharge from the urethra, tenderness on palpation of the left testis, but no other abnormalities are noted.

The laboratory test results show positive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for Chlamydia trachomatis infection only.

What is the most appropriate management plan? 

A. Treat only chlamydial infection 
B. Treat chlamydial infection along with empirical coverage for gonococcal infection 
C. Perform additional testing to confirm gonococcal co-infection before initiating treatment 
D. Refer to urologist for further management 
E. No treatment required at present 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient has symptoms suggestive of epididymitis, which can be caused by either chlamydial or gonococcal infection. Therefore, empirical coverage for both infections is recommended until the results of additional testing are available to confirm the diagnosis. In this case, since the patient has positive results for chlamydial infection only, he should be treated with a single dose of azithromycin along with empirical coverage for gonococcal infection using intramuscular ceftriaxone or oral ciprofloxacin.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with palpitations, sweating, and shortness of breath. She reports feeling anxious and worried constantly for the past few months.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath and cough for the past week. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently on inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. On examination, he is tachypneic with increased work of breathing, using accessory muscles to breathe. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing and crackles bilaterally.

Arterial blood gas analysis shows pH 7.30, PaCO2 65 mmHg, PaO2 50 mmHg, HCO3- 28 mEq/L, and SaO2 82%. Chest X-ray shows hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
B. High-flow nasal cannula therapy
C. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation
D. Inhaled nitric oxide therapy
E. Intravenous magnesium sulfate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient has acute exacerbation of COPD with respiratory failure requiring urgent intervention to improve oxygenation and reduce carbon dioxide retention. The most appropriate initial management would be non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), which can help improve gas exchange by reducing the work of breathing and increasing functional residual capacity while avoiding the risks associated with invasive mechanical ventilation.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of persistent cough productive of yellow sputum for the past six months that worsens during cold weather or exposure to irritants such as smoke or dust. She also reports exertional dyspnea that limits her daily activities and frequent chest infections over the past year despite receiving antibiotics multiple times.

On examination, she appears thin and cachectic with pursed-lip breathing. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse expiratory wheezing and crackles bilaterally. Spirometry shows a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 45% predicted, a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 60% predicted, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.6.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Asthma
B. Bronchiectasis
C. Chronic bronchitis
D. Emphysema
E. Pulmonary fibrosis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and usually progressive over time due to a combination of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The history of smoking, cough, sputum production, dyspnea on exertion, recurrent chest infections, cachexia, pursed-lip breathing, and spirometry showing fixed airflow obstruction with reduced FEV1/FVC ratio all support the diagnosis of COPD with predominant emphysematous phenotype.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to the respiratory clinic for follow-up after being diagnosed with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He reports worsening shortness of breath despite optimal medical therapy including inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids as well as oxygen therapy at home for desaturations during sleep.

On examination, he appears cyanotic with peripheral edema up to his knees. Chest auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally with prolonged expiration and occasional wheezes.

Echocardiography shows right ventricular hypertrophy with dilated right atrium and ventricle consistent with cor pulmonale.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Increase the dose of inhaled corticosteroids
B. Add a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)
C. Refer for pulmonary rehabilitation
D. Consider lung volume reduction surgery
E. Initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient has advanced COPD with cor pulmonale, which is associated with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) may be considered in selected patients with severe emphysema who have heterogeneous distribution of disease and low exercise capacity despite optimal medical therapy, as it can improve lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and quality of life in some cases. However, LVRS carries significant risks including mortality, morbidity, and prolonged hospitalization, and should only be performed by experienced surgeons in specialized centers after careful selection and evaluation of candidates.

Question

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. On examination, there is marked tenderness on palpation in the right iliac fossa. Blood tests reveal an elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP). CT scan confirms acute appendicitis with periappendiceal abscess formation. The patient is started on intravenous antibiotics and undergoes percutaneous drainage of the abscess. Following resolution of the abscess, she is scheduled for an interval laparoscopic appendicectomy.
Which of the following is a potential complication associated with this approach? 

A. Wound infection
B. Intra-abdominal adhesions 
C. Bowel obstruction 
D. Incisional hernia 
E. Appendiceal stump leakage

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Interval laparoscopic appendicectomy involves delayed removal of the appendix after initial treatment with antibiotics and/or drainage of any associated abscess or collection. This approach has been shown to be safe and effective in selected patients with complicated appendicitis, but it carries a risk of intra-abdominal adhesions which can lead to bowel obstruction.

Question
A 48-year-old man presents to his GP with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, fever and diarrhoea. He reports that he had similar symptoms about 3 weeks ago which resolved spontaneously after a few days without medical intervention.
On examination, there is mild tenderness over the right lower quadrant but no rebound or guarding.

Which of the following factors would increase the likelihood of an intraoperative finding of a retrocaecal appendix? 

A. Age over 50 years
B. Female gender
C. History of previous abdominal surgery 
D. Presence of a faecolith within the appendix lumen 
E. Elevated white cell count

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The position of the appendix can vary greatly among individuals, but it is most commonly located in the retrocaecal or pelvic region. Retrocaecal appendicitis may present atypically and can be more difficult to diagnose clinically or radiologically than typical appendicitis. Older age has been identified as a risk factor for retrocaecal location due to changes in peritoneal anatomy and mobility with ageing.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents with chronic diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. He has a history of coeliac disease that was diagnosed 5 years ago and he has been on a strict gluten-free diet since then. However, his symptoms have persisted despite adherence to the diet.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department in active labour at 36 weeks gestation with a history of premature rupture of membranes for 24 hours. On examination, her cervix is found to be fully dilated and the presenting part is at station +2. During vaginal examination, you notice that there is a loop of umbilical cord protruding through the cervix. What immediate management should be taken? 

A. Place the patient in Trendelenburg position
B. Administer intravenous oxytocin
C. Perform an artificial amniotomy 
D. Apply pressure on the fetal head during contractions 
E. Call for an urgent caesarean section

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Cord prolapse is a rare but serious obstetric emergency that occurs when the umbilical cord descends into the birth canal ahead of or alongside the presenting fetal part, leading to compression or occlusion of blood flow within it and potentially causing fetal hypoxia and death if not managed promptly. In this scenario, immediate delivery by caesarean section is essential as it allows rapid relief of pressure on the cord and ensures adequate oxygenation to the fetus.

Question
A 32-year-old primigravida presents in early labour at term with cephalic presentation and intact membranes. She has no significant medical history and her antenatal scans have been normal throughout pregnancy.
During labour, she experiences sudden onset severe abdominal pain with associated vaginal bleeding and decreased fetal movements.
On examination, you note that her cervix is fully dilated with visible umbilical cord prolapse through the vagina.
What would be your initial management? 

A. Administer intravenous antibiotics
B. Insert a Foley catheter into bladder
C. Perform an emergency forceps delivery
D. Elevate fetal presenting part manually 
E. Prepare for an immediate caesarean section

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In this scenario, the immediate aim is to relieve pressure on the cord and prevent further compression of blood flow. Elevating the fetal presenting part manually by placing the patient in Trendelenburg or knee-chest position with a rolled towel under her hips can help reduce cord compression until delivery can be achieved. This should be followed by urgent preparation for caesarean section if vaginal delivery is not imminent.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents at term in established labour with cephalic presentation and intact membranes. She has had an uneventful pregnancy and antenatal scans have been normal.
During labour, she experiences sudden onset severe abdominal pain with associated vaginal bleeding and decreased fetal movements.
On examination, you note that her cervix is fully dilated with visible umbilical cord prolapse through the vagina.
What would be your next step? 

A. Administer intravenous antibiotics
B. Perform an artificial amniotomy 
C. Apply pressure on the fetal head during contractions 
D. Prepare for an immediate caesarean section
E. Insert a Foley catheter into bladder

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In this scenario, performing an artificial amniotomy may help speed up delivery and reduce pressure on the cord by allowing more space for descent of the presenting part. However, it should only be done if there are no signs of infection or other contraindications such as abnormal lie or presentation, placenta praevia or vasa praevia which could increase risk of fetal distress or haemorrhage. If there is no improvement after amniotomy or if there are signs of fetal compromise, then emergency caesarean section should be performed promptly to ensure optimal outcome for both mother and baby.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents with a history of chronic cough and dyspnoea on exertion for the past 10 years. She has been diagnosed with asthma in the past, but her symptoms have not improved despite regular use of inhalers. She is also a smoker with a 30 pack-year history.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of recurrent episodes of acute monoarticular arthritis with severe pain, swelling and tenderness is suggestive of crystal arthropathy such as gout or pseudogout but cannot be confirmed without definitive diagnosis by synovial fluid analysis that can differentiate between urate and calcium pyrophosphate crystals under polarized light microscopy. Therefore, performing an arthrocentesis of the affected joint is the most appropriate next step in management.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of chronic bilateral knee pain that has been gradually worsening over several years despite taking regular analgesics including paracetamol and NSAIDs prescribed by his rheumatologist for suspected osteoarthritis based on clinical symptoms alone. He reports no other medical problems or recent illnesses but admits to consuming large amounts of alcohol daily along with a high purine diet consisting mainly of seafood products.
On examination, there is marked crepitus on movement with reduced range of motion due to stiffness and pain bilaterally without any obvious skin changes or fever.
What is the most likely cause? 

A. Gout
B. Pseudogout
C. Rheumatoid arthritis 
D. Septic arthritis
E. Osteoarthritis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation of chronic bilateral knee pain with crepitus on movement, reduced range of motion due to stiffness and pain without any obvious skin changes or fever suggests osteoarthritis as the underlying cause. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as the knees and hips, especially in older adults or those with risk factors such as obesity, previous joint injury, or repetitive stress on the joints. It is not associated with crystal arthropathy like gout or pseudogout which typically present acutely with monoarticular involvement.

Question
A 9-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents who are concerned about his behaviour at school. He has difficulty paying attention in class, often interrupts others and blurts out answers before questions have been completed.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with a history of weight gain, easy bruising, and muscle weakness for the past year. She also reports having irregular menstrual cycles and excessive hair growth on her face and chest. On examination, she has central obesity, a buffalo hump, and multiple purplish striae on her abdomen and thighs. Her blood pressure is elevated at 160/100 mmHg. Laboratory testing reveals elevated serum cortisol levels and low ACTH levels.
Which of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate to identify the cause of this patient's Cushing's syndrome? 

A. CT scan of the adrenal glands
B. MRI of the pituitary gland
C. PET scan
D. Ultrasound of the liver
E. Chest X-ray

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease). Therefore, MRI of the pituitary gland is recommended as it can help identify any abnormalities in the pituitary gland that may be causing excess ACTH secretion.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome including weight gain, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis. He has been taking high doses of oral prednisolone for his rheumatoid arthritis for several years.
What is the mechanism by which exogenous corticosteroids such as prednisolone can lead to Cushing's syndrome? 

A. Inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis 
B. Stimulation of ACTH secretion 
C. Direct stimulation of cortisol receptors 
D. Suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
E. Increased production of aldosterone

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Exogenous corticosteroids suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) function, leading to decreased endogenous cortisol production. This results in a negative feedback loop where the pituitary gland continues to produce ACTH despite high levels of circulating cortisol. Over time, this can lead to adrenal atrophy and Cushing's syndrome.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome including weight gain, fatigue, and muscle weakness. Laboratory testing reveals elevated serum cortisol levels and low ACTH levels. Imaging studies reveal bilateral adrenal masses.

They often present with symptoms like itching, bleeding or ulceration when they become more advanced or neglected for a long time.

Question
A 25-year-old female with cystic fibrosis presents to the clinic with complaints of worsening dyspnea, cough and sputum production for the past few weeks. She is on treatment with inhaled bronchodilators, mucolytics and antibiotics. Her latest spirometry shows a decline in her FEV1 from 50% predicted to 40% predicted over the last year. On examination, she has bilateral coarse crackles and clubbing of fingers. Chest X-ray reveals hyperinflation and bronchiectasis.
Which one of the following options best describes the pathophysiology behind bronchiectasis in patients with cystic fibrosis? 

A. Chronic inflammation leads to destruction of airway walls
B. Increased mucus secretion leading to obstruction and infection
C. Abnormal ciliary function leading to stasis of secretions
D. Impaired surfactant production leading to alveolar collapse 
E. Hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells leading to airway narrowing

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The underlying mechanism behind bronchiectasis in patients with cystic fibrosis is increased mucus secretion due to defective CFTR protein resulting in dehydration of the airway surface liquid (ASL). This leads to thickened mucus that obstructs small airways causing distal air trapping, atelectasis, recurrent infections and eventually chronic inflammation which can lead to destruction of airway walls.

Question
A 30-year-old male patient with cystic fibrosis presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting for the past two days along with fever and chills. He has been compliant with his medications including pancreatic enzyme supplements, antibiotics and mucolytics but reports poor appetite for several months now.

A. Acute pancreatitis
B. Cholecystitis 
C. Small bowel obstruction
D. Appendicitis 
E. Mesenteric ischemia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The most common cause of acute exacerbation of abdominal symptoms in patients with cystic fibrosis is cholecystitis due to gall bladder stones and bile duct inflammation caused by thickened secretions that obstruct the biliary tree leading to stasis, infection and eventually inflammation.

Question
A 20-year-old female with cystic fibrosis presents to the clinic for her routine check-up. She has been compliant with her medications including pancreatic enzyme supplements, antibiotics and mucolytics but reports worsening dyspnea on exertion, cough and sputum production for the past few months along with recurrent sinus infections despite treatment with intranasal steroids and saline irrigation.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chronic rhinosinusitis
B. Allergic rhinitis
C. Nasal polyps
D. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus (CFRD)
E. Aspergillosis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Patients with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk of developing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) which can present as worsening respiratory symptoms, recurrent sinus infections, eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels despite optimal medical management for cystic fibrosis itself such as antibiotics, mucolytics and airway clearance techniques.

Question
A 56-year-old male presents to the emergency department with sudden onset left-sided facial weakness, which he noticed upon waking up in the morning. He also reports mild pain behind his left ear and decreased taste sensation on the anterior two-thirds of his tongue. On examination, there is drooping of the left side of the face, inability to close the left eye completely, and flattening of the nasolabial fold. The rest of his neurological exam is unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Bell's palsy
B. Ramsay Hunt syndrome
C. Stroke involving the facial nerve nucleus 
D. Lyme disease-associated facial palsy 
E. Idiopathic peripheral facial palsy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation described above is consistent with Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus), a viral infection caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus within the geniculate ganglion that affects cranial nerves VII and VIII. Patients typically present with acute-onset unilateral facial paralysis associated with vesicular rash in or around the ear canal, tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, and/or altered taste sensation on one side of their tongue.

Question
A 27-year-old female presents to her GP complaining of right-sided facial weakness that began gradually over several days and has now progressed to complete paralysis of her entire right face for three days prior to presentation. She denies any other symptoms or medical history except for occasional headaches that she attributes to stress at work.

Which one of these investigations would be most appropriate? 

A) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan
B) Computed tomography (CT) scan
C) Lumbar puncture
D) Electroencephalogram (EEG)
E) Nerve conduction studies

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation described above is consistent with a diagnosis of peripheral facial nerve palsy. In the absence of any other neurological symptoms or signs, an MRI brain scan would be most appropriate to rule out any underlying intracranial pathology such as tumors, abscesses, or demyelinating diseases that can mimic Bell's palsy.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to his GP with left-sided facial weakness and drooping that began suddenly while he was eating breakfast this morning. He denies any history of trauma, recent infections, or medical conditions except for hypertension and hyperlipidemia that are well-controlled on medications. On examination, there is complete paralysis of the left side of his face including forehead muscles (House-Brackmann grade VI). There is no evidence of hearing loss or tinnitus. Which one of these treatment options would be most appropriate? 

A) Prednisolone alone 
B) Aciclovir alone 
C) Combination therapy with prednisolone and aciclovir 
D) Referral to neurology for further evaluation 
E) Observation only without any intervention 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The sudden onset and complete involvement of all branches of the facial nerve in this patient raises suspicion for a central cause rather than Bell's palsy which typically involves only the lower motor neuron fibers. Therefore, referral to neurology for further evaluation including imaging studies such as MRI brain scan would be most appropriate before initiating any specific treatment.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents with a history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) despite being on long-term anticoagulation therapy. He reports no significant medical history apart from hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. The patient has undergone multiple investigations in the past for his recurrent DVTs, including genetic testing and imaging studies, but all have been inconclusive.

Further investigations reveal that the patient's blood tests are positive for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. What is the most likely underlying diagnosis? 

A. Antiphospholipid syndrome
B. Protein C deficiency
C. Factor V Leiden mutation
D. Homocystinuria 
E. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies suggests a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause recurrent DVTs despite adequate anticoagulation therapy.

Question
A 65-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of swelling and pain in her left leg that has been progressively worsening over the last week. She denies any recent travel or immobilisation but reports having had surgery for a hip replacement two years ago.

On examination, there is tenderness and warmth over the left calf muscle, along with pitting edema up to mid-thigh level. An ultrasound scan confirms the presence of a proximal femoral vein thrombus.

What is the most appropriate initial management strategy? 

A. Start low molecular weight heparin immediately
B. Prescribe oral warfarin therapy 
C. Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
D. Refer for surgical intervention 
E. Advise bed rest and limb elevation only

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Low molecular weight heparin is the preferred initial treatment for acute DVT, followed by oral anticoagulation therapy. tPA and surgical intervention are reserved for cases of severe or life-threatening DVTs.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents with a history of recurrent DVTs despite being on long-term anticoagulation therapy. He reports no significant medical history apart from a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer, which was treated with surgery two years ago.

Further investigations reveal that the patient has developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) due to his prolonged use of low molecular weight heparin. What is the most appropriate alternative anticoagulant? 

A. Rivaroxaban 
B. Apixaban
C. Edoxaban 
D. Fondaparinux 
E. Argatroban

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In patients with HIT, direct thrombin inhibitors such as argatroban are recommended as an alternative anticoagulant due to their lower risk of cross-reactivity with heparins compared to other agents like factor Xa inhibitors or fondaparinux.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his ophthalmologist with a complaint of recurrent episodes of redness and swelling in the right upper eyelid for the past six months. He reports that each episode lasts for about two weeks, during which he experiences mild pain and discomfort. The patient denies any history of trauma or infection to the eye or surrounding areas. On examination, there is a palpable nodule on the right upper eyelid, which is tender to touch. There are no signs of inflammation or discharge from the eye.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chalazion
B. Blepharitis
C. Hordeolum
D. Meibomian gland dysfunction
E. Eyelid dermatitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), which is a common condition characterized by obstruction and inflammation of the meibomian glands located within the eyelids. MGD can cause recurrent episodes of eyelid swelling, redness, and tenderness due to accumulation of secretions within the glands leading to blockage and rupture.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a complaint of drooping of her left upper eyelid for several months, which has been progressively worsening over time. She also reports experiencing double vision when looking up or to the side in certain positions but not all the time.
On examination, you note ptosis (drooping) of her left upper eyelid with poor levator function upon testing using an instrument known as a "lid-lift test." There is also evidence of weakness in her left superior rectus muscle causing diplopia (double vision) on upward gaze.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Myasthenia gravis
B. Horner's syndrome
C. Third nerve palsy
D. Fourth nerve palsy 
E. Cavernous sinus syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of myasthenia gravis, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. Ptosis and diplopia are common symptoms in patients with myasthenia gravis, especially when looking up or to the side. A lid-lift test can help confirm the diagnosis by assessing levator function.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents with a complaint of a painful swelling on his right lower eyelid for two days. He reports no history of trauma or infection to the eye or surrounding areas. On examination, there is a tender, erythematous nodule on the right lower eyelid margin.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chalazion
B. Blepharitis
C. Hordeolum
D. Meibomian gland dysfunction
E. Eyelid dermatitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests hordeolum (also known as a stye), which is a common acute inflammatory condition caused by bacterial infection of the hair follicles or glands within the eyelids. It typically presents as a tender, erythematous nodule at the eyelid margin and may be associated with discharge from the affected area. Treatment usually involves warm compresses and topical antibiotics if necessary.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse presents to the emergency department with confusion, lethargy and decreased urine output for the past 24 hours.

What is the most likely cause of his presentation? 

A. Acute kidney injury
B. Diabetic ketoacidosis
C. Hyperaldosteronism
D. Hypovolemic shock
E. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical picture suggests severe dehydration leading to hypovolemic shock due to alcohol-induced vomiting or diarrhea causing excessive fluid loss.

Question
An 80-year-old woman with a background of dementia is brought into hospital by her daughter who reports that she has been refusing food and fluids for the past week despite encouragement from family members. On examination, she appears dehydrated with sunken eyes, dry mouth, and poor skin turgor.

What would be an appropriate management plan? 

A. Initiate intravenous fluids immediately 
B. Offer oral rehydration therapy 
C. Withhold fluids as it may worsen her condition 
D. Administer diuretics to increase urine output 
E. Refer for palliative care

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In this case, oral rehydration therapy should be attempted first as it is less invasive than IV fluids and can improve hydration status in mild-moderate cases of dehydration.

Question
A 30-year-old female marathon runner presents to the clinic complaining of fatigue, muscle cramps, dizziness, and headache after completing a race in hot weather conditions without adequate fluid intake during the run.

What type of dehydration does she most likely have? 

A. Hypertonic dehydration 
B. Isotonic dehydration
C. Hypotonic dehydration 
D. Extracellular dehydration 
E. Intracellular dehydration

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In hypertonic dehydration, there is a greater loss of water than electrolytes leading to an increase in serum osmolality and sodium concentration due to the movement of water from intracellular space to extracellular space causing cellular shrinkage and symptoms such as fatigue, muscle cramps, dizziness, and headache seen in this patient.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with complaints of dizziness and a feeling of spinning when he turns his head or changes position. The symptoms have been present for the past week and are associated with nausea, vomiting, and sweating. He denies any history of head injury, hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear discharge. On examination, there is no nystagmus at rest but positional testing reveals horizontal nystagmus that lasts less than a minute upon turning his head to the right side.

Which canal is most likely affected in this patient? 

A. Anterior semicircular canal
B. Posterior semicircular canal
C. Lateral semicircular canal
D. Utricle
E. Saccule

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presence of horizontal nystagmus lasting less than a minute upon turning the head to one side suggests involvement of the lateral semicircular canal on that side.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents with recurrent episodes of vertigo that last for several minutes and are triggered by sudden movements such as getting out of bed or rolling over in bed. She also experiences nausea and vomiting during these episodes but has no hearing loss or tinnitus. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she takes medications regularly.

What is the most appropriate initial management strategy for this patient? 

A. Prescribe meclizine 
B. Perform an MRI brain scan 
C. Recommend vestibular rehabilitation therapy 
D. Administer intratympanic gentamicin injection 
E. Refer her to an ENT specialist

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Given her age and lack of hearing loss/tinnitus, it is important to rule out other causes of vertigo such as central pathology or Meniere's disease before initiating treatment for BPPV; therefore referral to an ENT specialist would be the most appropriate initial management strategy.

Question

Explanation: Delirium can be triggered by various factors such as infections, medications or metabolic disturbances that cause an imbalance in neurotransmitters leading to confusion and cognitive impairment.

Question
An elderly man with a history of dementia was admitted to the hospital after being found wandering aimlessly in his neighborhood at night. He had no identification documents on him but was able to provide his name when asked repeatedly. His family reported that he had been experiencing worsening memory loss over the past few months and had become increasingly agitated in recent weeks.

On examination, he appears restless and anxious with fluctuating levels of consciousness throughout the day. He has difficulty following commands and seems unaware of his surroundings at times.

What type of delirium does this patient most likely have? 

A. Hyperactive delirium 
B. Hypoactive delirium 
C. Mixed-type delirium 
D. Subsyndromal delirium 
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient is exhibiting features of both hyperactive and hypoactive delirium, indicating a mixed-type presentation.

Question
A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with confusion and agitation. She has been taking tramadol for her pain for the past two weeks but ran out of medication three days ago. On examination, she appears disoriented and agitated, with tremors in her hands and tongue. Her blood pressure is elevated at 170/100 mmHg, heart rate is 120 bpm, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation on room air is 94%.

Which of the following medications would be appropriate to manage this patient's symptoms? 

A. Haloperidol 
B. Lorazepam 
C. Tramadol 
D. Acetaminophen 
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are often used to manage agitation in patients with delirium caused by withdrawal from opioids or other substances. Haloperidol may worsen cognitive impairment in elderly patients while acetaminophen does not have any effect on delirium symptoms.

Question
A 75-year-old man presents to his GP with urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia. He also reports a weak stream of urine and difficulty starting urination. The GP suspects benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and performs a digital rectal exam that reveals an enlarged prostate gland. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 

The GP decides to initiate pharmacological therapy for BPH but is concerned about potential drug interactions with the patient's current medications. Which of the following drugs used in the treatment of BPH should be avoided in this patient? 

A. Tamsulosin
B. Finasteride
C. Dutasteride
D. Terazosin
E. Silodosin

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Terazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist commonly used in the management of BPH symptoms by relaxing smooth muscle tone in the bladder neck and prostate gland, improving urinary flow rates and reducing symptoms such as hesitancy, urgency, and frequency. However, terazosin has been associated with orthostatic hypotension which can be exacerbated by concomitant use of antihypertensive medications like those used to treat hypertension in this patient.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his urologist with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of BPH including hesitancy, intermittency, straining to void, decreased force of stream, incomplete emptying, urgency and frequency during daytime hours or at night (nocturia). His International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is 25 out of a possible score range from 0-35 indicating moderate-to-severe symptom severity.

After performing a thorough evaluation including serum PSA levels and digital rectal examination (DRE), he is diagnosed with symptomatic BPH. The urologist discusses the various treatment options with the patient, including watchful waiting, medical therapy, and surgical intervention.

What is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient? 

A. Watchful waiting
B. Medical therapy with an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist
C. Medical therapy with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor
D. Combination medical therapy with both an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor
E. Surgical intervention

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Combination medical therapy with both an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist (such as tamsulosin) and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (such as finasteride or dutasteride) has been shown to be more effective than either medication alone in reducing symptoms of BPH and improving urinary flow rates. This combination approach targets two different aspects of the pathophysiology of BPH - smooth muscle tone relaxation via alpha-blockade and reduction in prostate size via inhibition of dihydrotestosterone production by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase enzyme activity.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of BPH including hesitancy, intermittency, straining to void, decreased force of stream, incomplete emptying, urgency and frequency during daytime hours or at night (nocturia). His International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is 20 out of a possible score range from 0-35 indicating moderate symptom severity.

The GP performs a digital rectal examination that reveals an enlarged but non-tender prostate gland consistent with BPH. The GP initiates pharmacological therapy for symptomatic relief but advises the patient about potential side effects associated with these medications.

Which one of the following drugs used in the treatment of BPH is most likely to cause retrograde ejaculation? 

A. Tamsulosin
B. Finasteride
C. Dutasteride
D. Terazosin
E. Silodosin

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Retrograde ejaculation is a potential side effect of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists like tamsulosin that relax smooth muscle tone in the bladder neck and prostate gland, allowing semen to flow backward into the bladder instead of out through the urethra during ejaculation. This can result in decreased fertility or infertility but does not typically affect sexual function or orgasm intensity.

A.Frontotemporal dementia 
B. Alzheimer's disease 
C. Dementia with Lewy bodies
D.Vascular dementia
E.Normal pressure hydrocephalus

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features described are consistent with frontotemporal dementia which is characterised by changes in personality and behaviour, disinhibition, poor judgement and executive dysfunction.

Question
A 2-week-old female is brought to the emergency department with jaundice and pale stools. The baby was born at term via an uncomplicated delivery, but her mother had a history of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. On examination, the baby has hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Blood tests show raised conjugated bilirubin levels, elevated liver enzymes, and normal thyroid function tests. An abdominal ultrasound reveals absent or hypoplastic gallbladder and dilated extrahepatic bile ducts.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in confirming the diagnosis? 

A. Liver biopsy
B. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
C. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
D. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC)
E. Abdominal computed tomography (CT)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: MRCP is a non-invasive imaging modality that can accurately diagnose biliary atresia by demonstrating absence or discontinuity of the extrahepatic bile ducts.

Question
A 5-year-old child is brought to the paediatrician with concerns about developmental delay. The parents report that the child has difficulty with fine motor skills, struggles with dressing and feeding themselves, and has trouble with handwriting. On examination, you notice that the child has a weak grip strength and poor dexterity in both hands. There are no other significant findings on physical exam. Which of the following conditions should be considered as a possible cause for this presentation? 

A. Cerebral palsy
B. Duchenne muscular dystrophy
C. Fragile X syndrome
D. Rett syndrome 
E. Angelman syndrome

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The symptoms described suggest an isolated delay in fine motor skills, which can be seen in various conditions such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophies; however, these typically present earlier than age 5 years and have additional clinical features beyond just fine motor delays. Rett syndrome presents similarly but typically affects only girls and is associated with regression of previously acquired skills rather than delayed development from birth onwards. Angelman syndrome may also present with developmental delay but often includes more severe intellectual disability and characteristic behavioural features such as hyperactivity and frequent laughter or smiling episodes without obvious stimuli. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that can result in mild to moderate intellectual disability, language delays, social anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and/or sensory processing difficulties.

Question
A 2-year-old boy is referred to your clinic by his primary care physician due to concerns about global developmental delay. His mother reports that he does not yet walk independently or use any words consistently despite babbling frequently since infancy; he also seems uninterested in playing with toys or interacting socially with others outside of his immediate family members. Physical examination reveals normal growth parameters but hypotonia throughout all muscle groups tested along with some facial dysmorphisms. Which of the following genetic conditions should be considered? 

A. Down syndrome
B. Fragile X syndrome
C. Prader-Willi syndrome 
D. Turner syndrome 
E. Williams syndrome

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation described is consistent with a diagnosis of Williams syndrome, which is caused by a microdeletion on chromosome 7q11.23 and characterized by distinctive facial features (e.g., elfin facies), cardiovascular abnormalities (e.g., supravalvular aortic stenosis), connective tissue problems, intellectual disability, and/or behavioural issues such as hyperacusis or anxiety around strangers but often strong social skills with familiar people.

Question
A 6-month-old infant is brought to your clinic for routine well-child care. During the visit, you perform developmental screening using standardized tools and note that the child has not yet achieved several milestones expected for their age group, including rolling over or reaching for objects with both hands simultaneously; however, they do seem to have good head control and make eye contact when spoken to directly. You advise the parents that further evaluation may be warranted if these delays persist beyond what time frame? 

A. 2 months corrected age
B. 4 months corrected age
C. 6 months corrected age
D. 9 months chronological age 
E. 12 months chronological age

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Developmental delay refers to a significant lag in achieving one or more developmental milestones compared to typical expectations based on chronological or adjusted age (for preterm infants). While some degree of variation in timing is normal among infants, persistent delays beyond certain ages can indicate underlying medical or developmental problems that require further investigation and intervention as needed; therefore, it is generally recommended that any concerns about development be addressed promptly rather than waiting until later visits unless there are clear reasons to suspect transient factors such as prematurity or illness. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants be screened for developmental delays at 9, 18, and 30 months of age using validated screening tools such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ) or Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS).

Question
A 65-year-old male presents to his GP with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and difficulty passing urine for the past six months.

Which of the following would be an appropriate next step in management? 

A. Radical cystectomy
B. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT)
C. Chemotherapy alone
D. Radiotherapy alone
E. Watchful waiting

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Radical cystectomy is considered as first-line treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Question
A 58-year-old female presents to her GP with a three-month history of painless haematuria and lower abdominal discomfort. She has a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, but otherwise well-controlled with medication. Her family history is negative for malignancy.
On physical examination, there are no palpable masses or lymphadenopathy.
The patient undergoes flexible cystoscopy which shows multiple papillary lesions arising from the bladder mucosa consistent with non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma.

What would be an appropriate initial treatment option? 

A. Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy 
B. Systemic chemotherapy 
C. Cystectomy 
D. Radiation therapy 
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: A

Question
A 28-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents at 20 weeks’ gestation for her routine antenatal appointment. She is currently on metformin and has an HbA1c level of 52 mmol/mol (recommended at pregnancy <48 mmol/mol). The patient asks about the risks associated with her condition during pregnancy and how she can manage them effectively.
Which of the following statements regarding pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy is correct? 

A. Women with pre-existing diabetes should be advised to deliver by induction of labour or Caesarean section between 38 and 39+6 weeks’ gestation
B. All women with pre-existing diabetes should be offered retinal assessment at booking, then annually throughout their pregnancy
C. Women with pre-existing diabetes should have their insulin regimen reviewed every six months during their pregnancy 
D. Women with pre-existing diabetes are not at increased risk of developing hypertension during pregnancy
E. Women with pre-existing diabetes who plan to conceive should aim for an HbA1c level below 58 mmol/mol

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Pre-pregnancy counselling is essential for women with pre-existing diabetes as it allows optimisation of glycaemic control before conception, which reduces the risk of congenital malformations and perinatal complications. An HbA1c target below 48 mmol/mol is recommended before conception; however, this may need to be relaxed if hypoglycaemia occurs frequently or there is a high risk of severe hypoglycaemia.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents at 32 weeks' gestation complaining of blurred vision, headache, and epigastric pain that started two days ago. Her medical history includes type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed when she was eight years old, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia treated with atorvastatin. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, and her urine dipstick shows proteinuria.
Which of the following statements regarding this patient's condition is correct? 

A. This patient has gestational diabetes mellitus
B. The most likely cause of her symptoms is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
C. She should be started on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to control her hypertension
D. Delivery should be considered if there are signs of fetal distress or maternal deterioration 
E. A CT scan of the head should be performed to rule out cerebral haemorrhage

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient has pre-eclampsia, which is characterised by hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks' gestation in a previously normotensive woman. Pre-existing diabetes increases the risk of developing pre-eclampsia four-fold compared with non-diabetic women; therefore, close monitoring for its development is essential during pregnancy.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents at 16 weeks’ gestation for her first antenatal appointment. She has no significant medical history but reports that both her parents have type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed in their forties. Her BMI is 29 kg/m², and she has a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.8 mmol/L.
Which of the following statements regarding screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is correct? 

A. All pregnant women should undergo universal screening for GDM using a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test at booking
B. Women who are overweight or obese should not be screened for GDM as they are already at high risk 
C. Screening for GDM should be offered only to women with a family history of diabetes 
D. Women with one abnormal value on a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test do not require further testing 
E. Women with GDM should be offered lifestyle advice and dietary management as first-line treatment

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Screening for GDM is recommended at 24-28 weeks' gestation using a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test in women who do not have pre-existing diabetes. Lifestyle interventions, including diet and exercise, are the cornerstone of management for GDM; however, pharmacological therapy may be required if glycaemic targets are not achieved.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the ophthalmology clinic with a complaint of recurrent episodes of redness, itching, and burning sensation in both eyes for the past six months. He has been using over-the-counter eye drops without any relief. On examination, there is crusting at the eyelid margins which are red and inflamed.

Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient? 

A. Topical steroids
B. Systemic antibiotics
C. Warm compresses and lid hygiene
D. Artificial tears
E. Oral doxycycline

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest blepharitis, which can be caused by meibomian gland dysfunction or seborrheic dermatitis. Initial management should involve warm compresses to soften crusts followed by gentle cleaning of the lids with baby shampoo or commercially available lid scrubs twice daily along with artificial tears as needed.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of bilateral dry eyes that have been worsening over several months despite using over-the-counter lubricating eye drops regularly. She reports no other ocular symptoms but does complain of joint pain in her hands and knees.

On examination, there is mild erythema around both eyelids, but no discharge or crusting noted on palpation of the lid margins bilaterally.

What underlying systemic condition could be associated with this presentation? 

A. Rheumatoid arthritis 
B. Sjogren’s syndrome 
C. Lupus erythematosus 
D. Psoriasis 
E. Rosacea

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's history suggests possible Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes and mouth. Other symptoms may include joint pain, fatigue, and skin rashes. A diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome can be confirmed by blood tests for autoantibodies such as anti-SSA/SSB.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the ophthalmology clinic with complaints of recurrent episodes of redness, itching, and burning sensation in both eyes for the past year. He has been using over-the-counter eye drops without any relief. On examination, there is crusting at the eyelid margins which are red and inflamed bilaterally.

Which one of the following is a potential complication associated with this condition? 

A. Corneal ulceration 
B. Retinal detachment 
C. Optic neuritis 
D. Central retinal vein occlusion
E. Cataract formation

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Blepharitis can lead to corneal complications such as epithelial defects or ulcers due to chronic inflammation and meibomian gland dysfunction leading to tear film instability and dry eye disease.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to the endocrine clinic with a history of polyuria and polydipsia for the past six months. He denies any significant medical or surgical history, but reports having a family history of diabetes insipidus. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities except for mild dehydration.

The patient undergoes a water deprivation test which shows the following results:

Baseline serum osmolality: 290 mOsm/kg (normal range: 275-295)
Baseline urine osmolality: 100 mOsm/kg
After eight hours of fluid deprivation:
Urine osmolality: 50 mOsm/kg

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus 
B. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
C. Primary polydipsia 
D. Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) 
E. Renal tubular acidosis 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The low urine osmolality after fluid deprivation suggests that there is an inability to concentrate urine, indicating either cranial or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Since this patient has no known risk factors for primary polydipsia or SIADH, and his family history suggests an inherited condition, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of excessive thirst and urination over the last few weeks. She also reports feeling fatigued and experiencing headaches frequently.

Serum glucose level - 300 mg/dL (normal range:<100)

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus 
B. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
C. Primary polydipsia 
D. Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) 
E.Diabetes mellitus

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with uncontrolled hyperglycemia due to diabetes mellitus, which can cause polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration. The high serum glucose level is a key diagnostic feature of diabetes mellitus.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He has been experiencing these symptoms for the past two days and they have progressively worsened. His blood glucose level is 18 mmol/L and his HbA1c is 10%. On examination, he appears dehydrated and there is tenderness in the epigastric region. An ultrasound shows gallstones but no evidence of cholecystitis or pancreatitis.

Which one of the following is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?

A. Admit him to hospital for intravenous fluids and insulin therapy
B. Administer oral hypoglycaemic agents to control his blood glucose levels
C. Perform an urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy
D. Start him on metformin therapy to improve glycaemic control
E. Refer him to a specialist endocrinologist

Explanation: This patient's presentation suggests diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. The presence of gallstones does not explain his symptoms and should not distract from managing his DKA.

Question
A 28-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to her general practitioner with complaints of recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia despite reducing her insulin dose as advised by her diabetologist. She reports that she has also been experiencing palpitations, sweating, tremors, and anxiety during these episodes.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in diagnosing the cause of her recurrent hypoglycaemia? 

A. C-peptide levels 
B. Anti-insulin antibodies 
C. Serum cortisol levels 
D. Plasma renin activity 
E. Thyroid function tests

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Recurrent hypoglycaemia in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus can be due to several causes, including insulinoma, surreptitious insulin use, or anti-insulin antibodies. Anti-insulin antibodies interfere with the action of exogenous insulin and can cause unpredictable fluctuations in blood glucose levels.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with complaints of fatigue, blurred vision, and polyuria for the past few months. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia but is not on any medications currently. On examination, his BMI is 28 kg/m² and there are no signs of diabetic complications such as retinopathy or neuropathy. His fasting plasma glucose level is 7.8 mmol/L and HbA1c is 6.5%.

Which one of the following would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Start him on metformin therapy 
B. Refer him to an ophthalmologist for screening 
C. Perform an oral glucose tolerance test 
D. Measure his serum C-peptide levels 
E. Initiate lifestyle modifications

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient's presentation suggests early-stage type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild hyperglycaemia and no evidence of diabetic complications yet. Lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, exercise, and dietary changes should be initiated first before considering pharmacological therapies like metformin or sulfonylureas. Ophthalmologic screening may be necessary later if he develops retinopathy symptoms or if his glycaemic control worsens over time despite lifestyle interventions.

Question
A 60-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to the ophthalmology clinic for routine screening. On examination, he is found to have proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both eyes with neovascularization and vitreous hemorrhage in the left eye. The patient is referred for panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) laser treatment. Which of the following statements regarding PRP laser treatment is true? 

A. It can cause permanent visual loss
B. It should be avoided in patients with severe hypertension
C. It can lead to regression of neovascularization
D. It has no effect on macular edema 
E. It is contraindicated in patients with cataracts

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) laser treatment is used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy by causing regression of neovascularization and reducing the risk of further bleeding or detachment of the retina. While it may cause temporary visual disturbances such as glare or reduced night vision, it does not typically result in permanent visual loss unless complications occur during or after the procedure.

Question
A 55-year-old woman with a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents complaining of blurred vision and difficulty reading small print over the past few months. Visual acuity measured using a Snellen chart is reduced to 6/12 in both eyes, and fundoscopy reveals mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy with microaneurysms and dot-blot hemorrhages present bilaterally. Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate at this stage? 

A. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents
B. Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) laser treatment 
C. Observation and regular monitoring 
D. Vitrectomy surgery 
E. Focal laser treatment 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Focal laser treatment is indicated for mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema, as it can reduce the risk of visual loss and improve vision in some patients. Anti-VEGF agents are typically reserved for more severe cases or those with proliferative disease, while PRP laser treatment is used to treat neovascularization and prevent further complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment. Observation and regular monitoring may be appropriate if there is no evidence of macular edema or significant progression of disease.

Question
A 70-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents complaining of sudden onset painless loss of vision in his right eye over the past day. On examination, he has hand motion vision only in the affected eye with a relative afferent pupillary defect present. Fundoscopy reveals pale optic disc swelling and flame-shaped hemorrhages throughout the retina consistent with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate? 

A. Intravenous thrombolysis 
B. High-dose aspirin therapy 
C. Immediate panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) laser treatment
D. Urgent ophthalmology referral for possible intra-arterial fibrinolysis 
E. Observation and supportive care 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmic emergency that typically results in irreversible blindness if not treated promptly; however, there are limited options available once the event has occurred. While intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial fibrinolysis may be considered in select cases within a narrow time window, they carry significant risks and have uncertain efficacy in CRAO specifically. High-dose aspirin therapy has not been shown to improve outcomes in CRAO and may even worsen visual acuity. PRP laser treatment is not indicated for this condition. Observation and supportive care, including referral for low vision rehabilitation if appropriate, are the most appropriate interventions at this stage.

Question
A 32-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past two days. She reports that she has not been taking her insulin as prescribed due to financial constraints. On examination, she is tachycardic and hypotensive, with Kussmaul breathing and fruity breath odor. Laboratory investigations reveal hyperglycemia (plasma glucose level of 38 mmol/L), metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.10), elevated ketones in urine and blood, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and anion gap of 28 mEq/L.

What is the most appropriate initial management step for this patient? 

A. Administer intravenous fluids containing dextrose
B. Initiate continuous renal replacement therapy
C. Start intravenous bicarbonate infusion 
D. Administer subcutaneous insulin injection 
E. Perform urgent laparotomy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The first-line treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is fluid resuscitation with normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution containing dextrose once serum glucose levels fall below 14 mmol/L to prevent hypoglycemia while continuing insulin administration.

Question
A 25-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with complaints of fatigue, weakness, polyuria, and polydipsia over the past week. He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath but reports occasional episodes of palpitations at rest. On examination, he appears dehydrated with dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor but no signs of acute distress or neurological deficits are noted otherwise.

Which one of the following laboratory findings would be expected in this patient? 

A. Hypokalemia
B. Hypernatremia
C. Hypophosphatemia 
D. Elevated serum osmolality 
E. Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are consistent with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), a serious complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus characterized by severe dehydration, hyperglycemia (>33 mmol/L), and elevated serum osmolality (>320 mOsm/kg). Unlike diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), HHS is associated with normal or mildly elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, no ketonuria, and minimal or absent ketonemia.

Question
A 16-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath for the past day. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and was recently started on insulin pump therapy but has been noncompliant with her treatment regimen due to social stressors at school. On examination, she is tachypneic with shallow respirations and decreased air entry in both lung bases. Laboratory investigations reveal hyperglycemia (plasma glucose level of 28 mmol/L), metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.20), elevated ketones in urine and blood, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and anion gap of 22 mEq/L.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's respiratory distress? 

A. Diabetic ketoacidosis-induced pulmonary edema
B. Acute exacerbation of asthma 
C. Pneumonia secondary to aspiration 
D. Pulmonary embolism 
E. Hyperventilation syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Respiratory distress in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can be caused by several factors including hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis-induced hyperventilation (Kussmaul breathing), and electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia or hyperkalemia. Pulmonary edema in DKA is thought to be due to increased capillary permeability and fluid shift from the intravascular space into the alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory compromise.

Question
A 55-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the clinic with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and increasing proteinuria over the past few months. She has no other significant medical history, but her blood pressure is elevated at 150/90 mmHg despite being on antihypertensive medication. Her serum creatinine level is within normal limits, but her urine dipstick test shows 4+ proteinuria. What would be the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient? 

A. Measure the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) on a spot urine sample
B. Perform a renal ultrasound scan 
C. Refer for kidney biopsy 
D. Start angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy 
E. Check for autoimmune markers

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In patients with diabetes, diabetic nephropathy is one of the leading causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of proteinuria in a patient with diabetes should raise suspicion for diabetic nephropathy as it indicates damage to the glomerular filtration barrier. The first step in investigating such patients is to measure the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) on a spot urine sample, which can help diagnose early stages of CKD due to diabetic nephropathy.

Question
A 60-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to his GP complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath over the past few weeks. He has been compliant with his insulin regimen and reports no changes in his appetite or weight loss/gain recently. On examination, he appears pale and tachycardic, with a blood pressure reading of 160/100 mmHg and mild ankle oedema noted bilaterally.
Blood tests reveal:
Haemoglobin - 8 g/dL
Serum creatinine - 300 µmol/L
Serum potassium - 6.0 mmol/L
Serum bicarbonate - 20 mmol/L
What is the most likely cause of this patient's anaemia? 

A. Iron deficiency anaemia 
B. Haemolytic anaemia 
C. Anaemia of chronic disease 
D. Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia 
E. Aplastic anaemia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Anaemia is a common complication of diabetic nephropathy and can be caused by several factors, including reduced erythropoietin production, shortened red blood cell lifespan due to uraemic toxins, and iron deficiency secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding or haematuria. In patients with diabetes, the most common type of anaemia is anaemia of chronic disease (ACD), which results from inflammation-induced suppression of erythropoiesis.

Question
A 70-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the clinic for follow-up after being diagnosed with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to diabetic nephropathy six months ago. He has been compliant with his medications and dietary restrictions but reports increasing fatigue and difficulty concentrating over the past few weeks.
Blood tests reveal:
Haemoglobin - 10 g/dL
Serum creatinine - 200 µmol/L
Serum potassium - 5.4 mmol/L
Serum bicarbonate - 22 mmol/L
Which medication would be most appropriate in managing this patient's symptoms? 

A. Erythropoietin-stimulating agents 
B. Oral iron supplements 
C. Folic acid supplementation 
D. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate 
E. Calcium carbonate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Patients with CKD due to diabetic nephropathy are at an increased risk of developing anaemia due to decreased erythropoietin production by the kidneys. Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) are commonly used to manage anaemia in such patients, but their use should be carefully monitored due to potential adverse effects such as hypertension and thromboembolic events. Other causes of anaemia, such as iron deficiency or vitamin deficiencies, should also be ruled out before initiating ESA therapy.

Question
A 55-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with acute onset of severe pain and weakness in his legs. On examination, he has reduced sensation up to his knees, absent ankle reflexes, and bilateral foot drop. His blood glucose level is significantly elevated.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Diabetic neuropathy
B. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)
C. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
D. Lumbosacral radiculopathy 
E. Spinal cord compression

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with AIDP, also known as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). This is an acute autoimmune disorder that affects peripheral nerves and can cause rapidly progressive muscle weakness and sensory loss, often starting in the lower limbs and ascending symmetrically upwards. Diabetes mellitus can be a risk factor for GBS.

Question
A 60-year-old woman with long-standing type 1 diabetes complains of numbness and tingling in her feet that has been gradually worsening over several years despite good glycaemic control. She reports difficulty walking due to balance problems and frequent falls.

On examination, there is evidence of distal sensory loss to pinprick and vibration sense bilaterally up to mid-shin level, absent ankle reflexes, and wasting of small muscles in the feet.

Which of the following investigations would be most helpful in confirming the diagnosis? 

A. Nerve conduction studies
B. Electromyography (EMG)
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lumbar spine
D. Serum vitamin B12 levels
E. Skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fibre density

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features suggest a diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fibre density is a non-invasive and reliable method to assess small-fibre neuropathy, which is commonly seen in diabetic neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies and EMG are more useful for assessing large-fibre sensory and motor function. MRI of the lumbar spine may be indicated if there is suspicion of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis. Serum vitamin B12 levels should be checked if there is clinical suspicion of pernicious anaemia.

Question
A 50-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presents with severe pain and burning sensation in his feet that has been gradually worsening over several months despite good glycaemic control. He also reports difficulty sleeping due to the discomfort.

On examination, there is evidence of distal sensory loss to pinprick and temperature sense bilaterally up to mid-shin level, intact ankle reflexes, and no muscle weakness.

Which of the following medications would be most appropriate as first-line treatment? 

A. Gabapentin
B. Amitriptyline
C. Duloxetine
D. Pregabalin 
E. Carbamazepine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with painful diabetic neuropathy, which can be difficult to manage effectively. First-line treatment options include duloxetine (a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) or pregabalin/gabapentin (calcium channel modulators). Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline may also be effective but have more side effects than newer agents. Carbamazepine is not recommended for this indication as it has limited efficacy and significant potential for drug interactions and adverse effects in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with a family history of breast cancer in her mother and sister. She is concerned about her risk of developing the disease and wants to know what screening options are available for her. As part of your explanation, you discuss the different types of breast cancer screening tests available, including mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). You explain that MRI is often used as an additional screening tool for women at high risk due to its increased sensitivity compared to mammography alone.
Which of the following statements regarding MRI as a screening tool for breast cancer is true? 

A. MRI should be offered as a routine screening test for all women over the age of 40
B. The use of MRI as a screening tool can lead to unnecessary biopsies and anxiety in patients
C. Women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations should not undergo MRI screening due to potential harm from radiation exposure
D. An abnormal finding on an MRI always indicates the presence of breast cancer 
E. The cost-effectiveness of using MRI as a routine screening tool has not been established

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: While there is evidence to suggest that adding MRI to mammography may increase detection rates in certain populations, such as those with a strong family history or genetic predisposition, it remains unclear whether this approach would be cost-effective on a population level.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with concerns about his risk of developing colorectal cancer due to his family history - both his father and grandfather were diagnosed with the disease in their 70s. He has no personal history of bowel problems but admits to occasional rectal bleeding and changes in bowel habits over the past year.
What is the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient? 

A. Flexible sigmoidoscopy 
B. Colonoscopy 
C. Faecal occult blood test 
D. CT colonography 
E. Barium enema 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients with a family history of colorectal cancer, screening should begin at an earlier age and may involve more frequent or intensive testing than in the general population. The faecal occult blood test is a simple and non-invasive way to detect hidden blood in the stool, which can be an early sign of colorectal cancer.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner for a routine check-up. She has no significant medical history but reports occasional headaches and visual disturbances over the past few months. On examination, you note that she has a BMI of 32 kg/m2 and elevated blood pressure readings.
Which of the following tests would be most appropriate as part of her cardiovascular disease risk assessment? 

A. Fasting lipid profile
B. ECG 
C. Carotid ultrasound 
D. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement 
E. Coronary artery calcium scoring 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: While all of these tests may be useful in assessing cardiovascular disease risk, a fasting lipid profile is recommended as part of routine screening in adults aged 40-74 years without known cardiovascular disease or diabetes, regardless of other risk factors such as hypertension or obesity. This test measures levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in the blood, which are important indicators of overall cardiovascular health.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding for the past 3 days. She has no significant medical history and is not taking any medications. On examination, she appears pale, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Laboratory investigations reveal a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL, platelet count of 30 x10^9/L, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and elevated fibrin degradation products (FDPs). The patient is diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to an underlying condition. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for DIC in this patient? 

A. Acute promyelocytic leukemia 
B. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
C. Hemolytic uremic syndrome
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus
E. Antiphospholipid syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Acute promyelocytic leukemia can cause DIC due to the release of large amounts of tissue factor from leukemic cells leading to activation of coagulation cascade resulting in consumption of clotting factors and platelets.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of liver cirrhosis presents to the hospital with fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice for one week duration. He was recently treated for pneumonia with antibiotics but his symptoms did not improve after treatment completion. On examination, he has ascites and hepatosplenomegaly along with petechiae on his skin and mucous membranes suggestive of bleeding diathesis. Laboratory investigations reveal low platelet count, prolonged PT/aPTT, elevated FDPs levels indicating DIC as a complication of his underlying disease process. What is the pathophysiology of DIC in this patient? 

A. Decreased synthesis of clotting factors by the liver 
B. Increased production of tissue factor by activated monocytes/macrophages
C. Autoimmune destruction of platelets 
D. Inherited deficiency of antithrombin III 
E. Overproduction of von Willebrand factor

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with underlying liver disease, there is an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of monocytes/macrophages leading to overproduction of tissue factor which triggers the coagulation cascade resulting in DIC.

Question
A 60-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer presents to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pain for two days duration. She was recently started on chemotherapy for her cancer treatment. On examination, she has tachypnea, hypoxia, and decreased breath sounds on the left side suggestive of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Laboratory investigations reveal low hemoglobin level, thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT/aPTT, elevated FDPs levels indicating DIC as a complication of her underlying malignancy and chemotherapy treatment. Which type of chemotherapy agent is most commonly associated with DIC? 

A. Anthracyclines 
B. Taxanes
C. Platinum compounds
D. Vinca alkaloids
E. Anti-estrogens

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Anthracycline-based chemotherapy agents such as doxorubicin are known to cause DIC due to direct endothelial damage leading to exposure of subendothelial collagen and release of tissue factor from damaged cells resulting in activation of coagulation cascade leading to consumption coagulopathy and bleeding diathesis.

Question
A 68-year-old man with a history of diverticular disease presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, distension and vomiting. On examination, he has rebound tenderness in his lower abdomen and signs of peritonitis. CT scan shows free air and fluid in the pelvis consistent with perforated diverticulitis.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. Intravenous antibiotics
B. Laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy 
C. Bowel rest and observation 
D. Insertion of a rectal tube 
E. Immediate surgical exploration

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient's presentation is concerning for complicated diverticulitis with perforation and peritonitis, which requires urgent surgical intervention. The correct answer is immediate surgical exploration.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of left-sided abdominal pain, bloating and constipation over the past year. She reports that these symptoms have been worsening despite dietary modifications and increased fibre intake.

On examination, there is mild tenderness on palpation of the left lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound tenderness.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Irritable bowel syndrome
B. Diverticulosis
C. Colorectal cancer
D. Crohn's disease
E. Ulcerative colitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's symptoms are suggestive of uncomplicated diverticular disease, which commonly presents as left-sided abdominal pain, bloating and altered bowel habits in middle-aged individuals without any alarming features such as bleeding or obstruction.

Question
A 72-year-old man presents to his GP with a six-month history of intermittent rectal bleeding associated with changes in bowel habit including diarrhoea alternating with constipation.

Colonoscopy reveals multiple polyps throughout the colon, some measuring up to 2 cm in size, with histopathology confirming tubulovillous adenomas.

What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Observation and repeat colonoscopy in 5 years
B. Sigmoid colectomy 
C. Endoscopic mucosal resection of polyps 
D. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
E. Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient's presentation is concerning for advanced diverticular disease complicated by multiple large adenomatous polyps, which carries a high risk of malignant transformation. The most appropriate management would be total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis to prevent progression to colorectal cancer.

Question
A couple presents to the antenatal clinic for genetic counseling after a previous pregnancy with a child diagnosed with Down's syndrome. The mother is 38 years old and has a family history of chromosomal abnormalities. What is the most appropriate test that should be offered to this couple? Describe the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of this test.

A. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT)
B. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
C. Amniocentesis
D. Karyotyping
E. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: NIPT is a highly sensitive and specific screening test for detecting fetal aneuploidies, including Down's syndrome, by analyzing cell-free DNA from the placenta in maternal blood samples. It has a sensitivity of over 99% and a false-positive rate of less than 0.1%. The PPV varies depending on the prevalence of Down's syndrome in the population being tested but can be as high as 90%. The NPV is close to 100%, meaning that if NIPT results are negative, it is highly unlikely that the fetus has Down's syndrome.

Question
A newborn baby girl is diagnosed with mosaic trisomy 21 following routine neonatal screening tests at birth due to her facial features suggestive of Down's syndrome. What percentage of cells would you expect to have three copies of chromosome 21? Which type of mosaicism is more common in cases of mosaic trisomy 21?

A. <5%; Mitotic nondisjunction
B. >50%; Meiotic nondisjunction
C. <20%; Post-zygotic mitotic error
D. >80%; Robertsonian translocation
E. <10%; Germinal mosaicism

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Mosaic trisomy 21 is a rare form of Down's syndrome that occurs when there is an error in cell division after fertilization, resulting in some cells having three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. The percentage of cells with trisomy 21 can vary widely, but it is typically less than 20%. Post-zygotic mitotic errors are more common than meiotic nondisjunction as they occur after fertilization and during early embryonic development.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP for preconception counseling. She has a family history of Down's syndrome and wants to know what her chances are of having a baby with this condition. What is the risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome at maternal age 45? Which prenatal diagnostic test would be recommended if she decides to proceed with pregnancy? Describe the risks associated with this test.

A. 1 in 30; Amniocentesis
B. 1 in 50; Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
C. 1 in 100; Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT)
D. 1 in 250; Karyotyping
E. <1%; Fetal ultrasound

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome increases significantly with maternal age, from about 1 in 1500 at age 20 to about 1 in 30 at age 45. Amniocentesis is the most commonly used prenatal diagnostic test for detecting chromosomal abnormalities such as Down's syndrome, especially for women over the age of 35 or those who have other risk factors. However, amniocentesis carries a small risk of miscarriage (about one in every few hundred procedures) due to infection or injury to the fetus or placenta during the procedure.

Question
A 28-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by his friends after they found him unresponsive in his apartment. The patient has a history of opioid addiction and was recently discharged from rehab. His friends report that he had been complaining of severe pain and had taken multiple doses of oxycodone before becoming unresponsive.

On examination, the patient is unconscious with pinpoint pupils and shallow breathing. Naloxone is administered, but there is no response. The medical team suspects that the patient may have ingested a sustained-release formulation of oxycodone, which requires specialized treatment.

What medication can be used as an antidote for sustained-release oxycodone overdose? 

A. Methadone
B. Buprenorphine
C. Flumazenil
D. Naltrexone
E. Nalmefene

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Sustained-release formulations of opioids like oxycodone can cause delayed toxicity due to their prolonged release into the bloodstream. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, can be used as an antidote for sustained-release oxycodone overdose.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to the emergency department with symptoms of acute liver failure following an intentional paracetamol overdose two days ago. She reports taking around 20 tablets (500mg each) at once in a suicide attempt.

On examination, she appears jaundiced with elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy consistent with hepatic dysfunction.

What is the recommended management strategy for this patient? 

A. Intravenous acetylcysteine infusion
B. Oral activated charcoal administration
C. Gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal administration
D. Liver transplant evaluation 
E. High-dose corticosteroid therapy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Acute liver failure caused by paracetamol overdose can be treated with intravenous acetylcysteine infusion, which replenishes glutathione stores in the liver and prevents further hepatotoxicity.

Question
A 50-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive in a public park. He has a history of alcoholism and drug abuse but has been abstinent for several months. On examination, he appears drowsy with pinpoint pupils and shallow breathing.

The medical team suspects that the patient may have ingested an opioid overdose, but they are unsure about the specific drug involved.

What laboratory test can help confirm the presence of opioids? 

A. Serum amylase levels
B. Blood glucose levels
C. Serum creatinine levels
D. Urine toxicology screen 
E. Arterial blood gas analysis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: A urine toxicology screen can detect the presence of opioids or their metabolites in the body, confirming opioid use or overdose even if the specific drug involved is unknown.

Question
A 19-year-old female presents to her GP with a history of binge eating followed by purging episodes for the past six months. She reports feeling guilty and ashamed after each episode, but is unable to control her urges to binge eat. Her BMI is within the normal range, but she reports significant weight fluctuations due to her disordered eating habits. Upon further questioning, she reveals that she has been experiencing intense anxiety and depression since the onset of her symptoms. Which one of the following treatment options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Interpersonal psychotherapy 
B. Dialectical behaviour therapy 
C. Acceptance and commitment therapy 
D. Cognitive behavioural therapy enhanced with exposure and response prevention techniques
E. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with bulimia nervosa, which typically involves recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviours such as purging or excessive exercise in order to prevent weight gain. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) enhanced with exposure and response prevention techniques has been shown to be an effective treatment option for bulimia nervosa, as it helps patients identify and challenge their maladaptive thoughts and behaviours related to food and body image.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to his GP with concerns about his recent weight loss despite maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in regular exercise. He admits to occasionally skipping meals when he feels stressed or anxious, but denies any other disordered eating behaviours or body image concerns. Physical examination reveals a BMI of 17, dry skin, brittle nails, lanugo hair growth on his arms, legs, and back, as well as bradycardia and hypotension suggestive of cardiovascular compromise. Laboratory tests reveal electrolyte imbalances consistent with severe malnutrition. Which one of the following diagnoses is most likely? 

A. Anorexia nervosa, restrictive subtype 
B. Anorexia nervosa, binge-purge subtype 
C. Bulimia nervosa
D. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder 
E. Other specified feeding or eating disorder

Correct Answer: A 

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with anorexia nervosa, restrictive subtype, which involves severe dietary restriction leading to significant weight loss and malnutrition. Patients with this subtype may also engage in excessive exercise as a means of burning calories and losing weight. Unlike the binge-purge subtype of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, patients with the restrictive subtype do not typically engage in purging behaviours such as vomiting or laxative abuse.

Question
A 30-year-old female presents to her GP with concerns about her recent weight gain despite maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in regular exercise. She reports feeling guilty and ashamed after each meal, but denies any other disordered eating behaviours or body image concerns. She has a history of childhood trauma and currently experiences symptoms of anxiety and depression that have been resistant to previous treatment attempts. Which one of the following diagnoses is most likely? 

A. Binge Eating Disorder 
B. Anorexia Nervosa 
C. Bulimia Nervosa
D. Orthorexia Nervosa 
E. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with orthorexia nervosa, which involves an obsessive preoccupation with "healthy" eating that can lead to significant dietary restriction and malnutrition over time. Unlike other eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, orthorexia does not necessarily involve distorted body image concerns or purging behaviours; rather, it is characterized by rigid adherence to self-imposed dietary rules that can interfere with social functioning and overall quality of life. Patients with orthorexia may also have a history of trauma or other mental health conditions that contribute to their disordered eating patterns.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She has a history of infertility and underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment three weeks ago. On examination, she appears pale and tachycardic, with diffuse abdominal tenderness on palpation. An ultrasound scan reveals an ectopic pregnancy in the right fallopian tube with evidence of rupture.

What is the most appropriate management for this patient? Consider the potential risks associated with IVF treatment.

A. Expectant management
B. Methotrexate
C. Salpingectomy
D. Laparoscopic salpingostomy
E. Conservative management

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In this case, due to the presence of ruptured ectopic pregnancy, immediate surgical intervention is necessary to prevent life-threatening hemorrhage. The patient's history of IVF increases her risk of ectopic pregnancy, which should be considered when evaluating any symptoms suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with lower abdominal pain and irregular vaginal bleeding for two weeks. She reports a positive home pregnancy test one month ago but denies any previous pregnancies or contraceptive use. On examination, there is mild tenderness on palpation of the left adnexa without rebound or guarding.

Which diagnostic modality would be most useful in confirming or ruling out an ectopic pregnancy? 

A. Transvaginal ultrasound 
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
C. Computed tomography (CT) scan
D. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
E. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: β-hCG levels are used as a marker for early detection and monitoring of pregnancy as well as identifying abnormal pregnancies such as ectopic pregnancies or gestational trophoblastic disease. In this case, a serum β-hCG level can help confirm or rule out an ectopic pregnancy as the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP with lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding for one day. She reports a positive home pregnancy test two weeks ago but denies any previous pregnancies or contraceptive use. On examination, there is tenderness on palpation of the right adnexa without rebound or guarding.

Which surgical approach would be most appropriate for management of this patient? Consider potential risks and benefits associated with each option.

A. Laparoscopic salpingectomy
B. Laparoscopic salpingostomy
C. Open laparotomy 
D. Expectant management
E. Methotrexate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Laparoscopic salpingostomy involves making a small incision in the fallopian tube to remove the ectopic pregnancy while preserving tubal function, which may be important for future fertility in young patients like this one who desire children in the future. However, if there is significant damage to the fallopian tube or severe hemorrhage, laparoscopic salpingectomy may be necessary instead. The choice of surgical approach should take into account factors such as age, reproductive goals, and overall health status of the patient.

Question
A 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a fall from a height of approximately 10 feet. He was not wearing any protective gear and landed on his head. On arrival, he is unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6/15. His pupils are unequal in size, with the left pupil dilated and unresponsive to light stimulation. CT scan reveals a large extradural haematoma overlying the right temporal region with significant mass effect causing midline shift.
Which one of the following is true regarding this patient's condition? 

A. The most common cause of an extradural haematoma is rupture of bridging veins
B. Immediate surgical intervention is not necessary if there are no focal neurological deficits
C. Patients with an extradural haematoma typically present with seizures within minutes of injury
D. The presence of a lucid interval rules out an extradural haematoma 
E. Anticoagulant therapy does not increase the risk for developing an extradural haematoma

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Extradural haemorrhage results from bleeding between the skull and dura mater, usually caused by trauma that ruptures meningeal arteries or venous sinuses leading to accumulation of blood under arterial pressure which can rapidly lead to brain herniation and death if untreated.

Question
A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after being involved in a motor vehicle accident where she was thrown through her car's windshield onto the pavement below, landing on her head and sustaining multiple injuries including facial fractures and scalp lacerations. She has been intubated due to decreased level of consciousness at the scene but now appears awake but confused with a GCS score of 12/15.
CT scan shows bilateral frontal contusions along with linear fractures involving both parietal bones extending into squamous portions of both temporal bones. There is also a small extradural haematoma overlying the left parietal region.
Which one of the following statements regarding this patient's condition is true? 

A. The presence of bilateral frontal contusions suggests that she may have sustained diffuse axonal injury
B. The linear fractures involving both parietal and temporal bones are unlikely to cause any neurological deficits 
C. A small extradural haematoma does not require surgical intervention and can be managed conservatively with observation alone
D. The Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12/15 indicates mild traumatic brain injury, which has an excellent prognosis for full recovery 
E. She should undergo immediate neurosurgical intervention due to the risk of increased intracranial pressure

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Bilateral frontal contusions suggest significant force applied to the head causing acceleration-deceleration injuries leading to diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Linear fractures involving both parietal and temporal bones indicate high energy impact trauma which increases the likelihood of associated intracranial pathology including extradural haemorrhage.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of persistent headaches for several weeks along with difficulty concentrating at work. He denies any history of head trauma or loss of consciousness but reports occasional episodes of dizziness when standing up quickly from a seated position.
On examination, he appears alert and oriented with no focal neurological deficits, but there is tenderness on palpation over his right occipital region.
MRI scan reveals a large extra-axial mass lesion in the right posterior fossa consistent with an acute subdural haematoma with midline shift.
Which one of the following statements about this patient's condition is true? 

A. Acute subdural haematomas typically present acutely after head trauma 
B. Tenderness on palpation overlying the site of the haematoma is a common finding 
C. The presence of midline shift on imaging indicates that surgery is not necessary 
D. Anticoagulant therapy does not increase the risk for developing an acute subdural haematoma
E. Subdural haematomas are less likely to cause mass effect compared to extradural haematomas

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Acute subdural haematomas typically present acutely after head trauma with loss of consciousness, whereas chronic subdural hematomas can have insidious onset and may present with nonspecific symptoms such as headache or confusion. Tenderness overlying the site of the haematoma is a common finding due to inflammation and irritation of surrounding tissues. Midline shift on imaging indicates significant mass effect which requires urgent surgical intervention in most cases. Anticoagulant therapy increases the risk for developing both acute and chronic subdural hematomas.

Question
A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department following a seizure. The parents report that he had a fever of 39°C and then suddenly started shaking all over, his eyes rolled back, and he became unresponsive for about 2 minutes before regaining consciousness. He has no previous history of seizures or neurological problems. After conducting several investigations, you diagnose him with febrile convulsions.

What are the potential long-term consequences of febrile convulsions? 

A. Increased risk of developing epilepsy 
B. Cognitive impairment 
C. Behavioural problems 
D. Learning difficulties 
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Febrile convulsions are usually benign and do not cause any long-term damage to the brain or nervous system. However, in rare cases, children who have experienced febrile convulsions may be at an increased risk of developing epilepsy later in life. Additionally, some studies suggest that there may be a link between febrile convulsions and cognitive impairment, behavioural problems, and learning difficulties.

Question
A 3-year-old girl presents to her GP with a high fever (40°C) and a history of two previous episodes of febrile seizures within the past year. She has no other significant medical history and is otherwise healthy.

What would be your management plan for this patient? 

A. Prescribe regular anticonvulsant medication 
B. Advise parents to administer paracetamol regularly during periods of fever 
C. Refer to paediatric neurologist for further investigation 
D. Perform EEG testing immediately
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In most cases, simple febrile convulsions do not require treatment beyond reassurance and advice on how to manage future episodes if they occur again in the future.
Parents should be advised to give their child paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce fever during periods of illness and to seek medical attention if the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes. Anticonvulsant medication is not recommended for simple febrile convulsions, as it does not prevent future episodes.

Question
A 5-year-old boy presents with a history of recurrent febrile seizures since infancy. His parents report that he has had at least one episode of febrile convulsion per year, which typically last less than 2 minutes and resolve spontaneously. He has no other significant medical history and is otherwise healthy.

What would be your next step in managing this patient? 

A. Prescribe regular anticonvulsant medication 
B. Perform EEG testing immediately 
C. Refer to paediatric neurologist for further investigation 
D. Advise parents on how to manage future episodes
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: While most cases of febrile convulsions are benign and do not require treatment beyond reassurance and advice on how to manage future episodes, recurrent or prolonged febrile seizures may warrant further investigation by a paediatric neurologist.
EEG testing may be performed to rule out underlying neurological conditions such as epilepsy or encephalitis, while anticonvulsant medication may be considered in certain cases where there is a high risk of recurrence or complications from the seizures.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In women with von Willebrand's disease who present with menorrhagia, an ultrasound scan of the pelvis is recommended to exclude structural abnormalities such as uterine fibroids or adenomyosis. Endometrial ablation may be considered in women with refractory menorrhagia who have completed childbearing. Progestogen-only pill and high-dose oestrogen tablets are not first-line treatments for menorrhagia in women with bleeding disorders.

Question
A 40-year-old male with severe haemophilia A presents to his GP complaining of persistent pain and swelling in his right knee that has been ongoing for several weeks despite factor VIII replacement therapy. On examination, there is a palpable mass over the anterior aspect of the knee joint, which is tender on touch and warm to feel. X-ray shows soft tissue swelling around the joint but no bony abnormalities.
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Haemophilic arthropathy
B. Septic arthritis 
C. Osteoarthritis 
D. Rheumatoid arthritis 
E. Gout 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Patients with haemophilia are at increased risk of developing septic arthritis due to repeated joint bleeds and exposure to contaminated needles during factor replacement therapy. The clinical features include fever, severe pain, erythema, warmth and tenderness over affected joints, along with restricted range of motion and systemic symptoms such as malaise and chills. Prompt treatment with antibiotics and drainage of infected fluid from the joint is essential to prevent irreversible damage to articular cartilage and bone.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of rectal bleeding for the past six months. He reports painless, bright-red blood on the toilet paper after defecation and occasional blood in the toilet bowl. The patient has no significant medical history and takes no regular medication. On examination, there is no palpable mass or tenderness on digital rectal examination, but an anoscopy reveals internal haemorrhoids.

What would be the most appropriate management option for this patient? 

A. Conservative measures including dietary changes and topical treatments
B. Rubber band ligation 
C. Infrared coagulation 
D. Haemorrhoidectomy 
E. Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient has grade II or III internal haemorrhoids that can be treated conservatively or by minimally invasive procedures such as rubber band ligation, infrared coagulation, or Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation (DGHAL). DGHAL is a newer technique that uses ultrasound guidance to identify and ligate the arterial supply to the haemorrhoids, leading to their shrinkage over time.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of anal itching and discomfort for several weeks. She also reports occasional rectal bleeding during bowel movements along with mucus discharge from her anus. The patient denies any abdominal pain or change in bowel habits but admits to having constipation occasionally.

On examination, there are multiple skin tags around the anus without any palpable masses on digital rectal examination.
Which one of the following conditions is most likely responsible for these symptoms? 

A) Anal fissure
B) Perianal abscess
C) Crohn’s disease
D) Rectal prolapse
E) Chronic external haemorrhoids

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient’s symptoms and examination findings are consistent with Crohn's disease, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Anal involvement in Crohn's disease can cause perianal skin tags, anal fissures, fistulas, abscesses, and haemorrhoids. Treatment options include topical or systemic steroids, immunomodulators, antibiotics, and surgical intervention if necessary.

Question
A 42-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of severe pain around his anus for the past two days. He reports a sudden onset of swelling and tenderness around the anus along with rectal bleeding during bowel movements. On examination, there is an external thrombosed pile at the anal verge.

Which one of the following management options would be most appropriate? 

A) Conservative measures including sitz baths and topical treatments
B) Rubber band ligation 
C) Infrared coagulation 
D) Incision and drainage 
E) Haemorrhoidectomy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient has an acute thrombosed external haemorrhoid that requires prompt treatment to relieve pain and prevent complications such as infection or necrosis. Conservative measures may provide some relief but are unlikely to resolve the problem completely. Rubber band ligation or infrared coagulation are not indicated for this type of haemorrhoid. Haemorrhoidectomy is reserved for recurrent or large internal haemorrhoids that do not respond to conservative or minimally invasive treatments. Incision and drainage under local anaesthesia is the preferred option for acute thrombosed external haemorrhoids within 72 hours of onset when they are most painful and tender.

A. Liver transplantation 
B. Renal replacement therapy 
C. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) 
D. Systemic corticosteroids 
E. Best supportive care

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: HRS is a serious complication of advanced liver disease and carries a poor prognosis without prompt intervention. Renal replacement therapy may be necessary in patients who develop acute kidney injury as a result of HRS while awaiting liver transplantation or other definitive treatment options.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a painful lump in his right inguinal region that has been present for 2 weeks. He reports no bowel or bladder symptoms, but he feels slightly nauseous. On examination, there is a tender erythematous lump consistent with an indirect inguinal hernia. His temperature is normal, and there are no signs of strangulation.

What is the most appropriate initial management plan for this patient? 

A. Immediate surgical repair
B. Observation and conservative management
C. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the hernia sac contents
D. Reduction of the hernia under sedation followed by elective surgical repair
E. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The recommended initial management for an uncomplicated indirect inguinal hernia is reduction under sedation followed by elective surgical repair within 2-4 weeks to prevent complications such as incarceration or strangulation.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of a bulge in her left groin that becomes more prominent when she coughs or strains. She denies any pain or discomfort associated with the bulge and reports no bowel or bladder symptoms.

On examination, there is a reducible swelling located inferomedial to the pubic tubercle consistent with a femoral hernia.

Which one of the following statements regarding femoral hernias is true? 

A. They are more common in males than females.
B. They have a higher risk of incarceration compared to other types of hernias.
C. They are usually asymptomatic until they become irreducible.
D. They are typically caused by weakness in the transversalis fascia.
E. They can be repaired using an anterior approach without mesh placement.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Femoral hernias have a higher risk of incarceration compared to other types of hernias, with a reported incidence of up to 20%. They are more common in females than males and are typically caused by weakness in the femoral ring. Repair is usually performed using an anterior approach with mesh placement.

Question
A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. He reports no bowel or bladder symptoms but has not passed flatus for several hours. On examination, there is a tender irreducible lump located in his right inguinal region associated with erythema of the overlying skin. His temperature is elevated, and he appears unwell.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia
B. Strangulated direct inguinal hernia
C. Perforated appendicitis
D. Acute cholecystitis
E. Diverticulitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of severe pain, vomiting, and signs of inflammation along with an irreducible lump suggests strangulation of a hernia. Direct inguinal hernias have a higher risk of strangulation compared to indirect inguinal hernias due to their location medial to the inferior epigastric vessels and may present as an acute surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention to prevent bowel ischemia or perforation.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of genital ulcers and painful urination. She reports having had unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the past year. On examination, she has several small vesicular lesions on her labia and perineum. The patient is diagnosed with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.

Which of the following is true regarding HSV? 

A. HSV-1 typically causes genital herpes while HSV-2 typically causes oral herpes.
B. Primary genital herpes usually presents as a single ulcerative lesion.
C. Antiviral therapy can cure HSV infection.
D. Asymptomatic shedding of the virus occurs only during outbreaks.
E. Vaccines are available for both HSV-1 and HSV-2.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: While both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause either oral or genital infections, primary genital herpes usually presents as multiple vesicular lesions rather than a single ulcerative lesion (option B). Antiviral therapy can suppress symptoms but does not cure the infection (option C). Asymptomatic shedding of the virus can occur between outbreaks, increasing transmission risk (option D). Currently, there are no vaccines available for either type of HSV (option E).

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with a rash on his left forehead that has been present for two days. He reports experiencing tingling and burning sensations in the area prior to the onset of the rash. On examination, he has grouped vesicles on an erythematous base overlying his left ophthalmic division dermatome.

What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient? 

A. Oral acyclovir
B. Topical corticosteroids
C. Intravenous immunoglobulin
D. Oral prednisolone
E. Intralesional interferon alpha

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient is presenting with herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles. Oral antiviral therapy with acyclovir or a related drug is the mainstay of treatment (option A). Topical corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation but should not be used alone (option B). Intravenous immunoglobulin and oral prednisolone are not recommended for routine use in uncomplicated cases of herpes zoster (options C and D), while intralesional interferon alpha has limited evidence supporting its use.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of painful genital ulcers that have been occurring every few months for the past year. She reports having had unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners during this time period. On examination, she has several small ulcerative lesions on her labia and perineum.

Which of the following tests would be most useful in confirming a diagnosis? 

A. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of lesion swabs
B. Serological testing for herpes simplex virus antibodies
C. Culture of lesion material on viral transport medium
D. Tzanck smear analysis of lesion scrapings
E. Gram stain of lesion exudate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: PCR testing of lesion swabs is the most sensitive and specific method for detecting HSV infection (option A). Serological testing can confirm previous exposure but cannot distinguish between active and latent infections (option B). Culture can also detect HSV but is less sensitive than PCR and requires specialized laboratory techniques (option C). Tzanck smear analysis and gram staining are nonspecific tests that may show characteristic findings but cannot definitively diagnose HSV infection.

Question
A 70-year-old male presents with a history of recurrent episodes of vomiting, abdominal pain and bloating for the past six months. He has lost approximately 10 kg in weight during this period.

What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient? 

A. Lifestyle advice
B. Lifestyle advice and PPIs 
C. Laparoscopic repair 
D. Open surgical repair 
E. Referral to gastroenterology

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The initial management of symptomatic patients with sliding hiatus hernias involves lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, avoiding large meals before bedtime, elevating the head of the bed while sleeping and smoking cessation along with PPI therapy which can provide relief from reflux symptoms by reducing acid secretion in the stomach.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is admitted to the hospital for an exacerbation of his condition. He is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and nebulizers. On day three of admission, he develops fever, chills, and rigors. Blood cultures are drawn, which come back positive for gram-negative rods. The patient's urine culture also grows the same organism. The clinical microbiologist recommends stopping the current antibiotics and starting him on meropenem and ciprofloxacin.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Ventilator-associated pneumonia
B. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection 
C. Central line-associated bloodstream infection 
D. Surgical site infection 
E. Clostridium difficile colitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient has developed sepsis with positive blood cultures indicating central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The recommendation to stop current antibiotics and start meropenem and ciprofloxacin covers both gram-negative bacteria from the blood cultures as well as potential uropathogens from the urine culture.

Question
A 70-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type II presents to the emergency department with cellulitis in her left leg that has been worsening over several days despite oral antibiotics prescribed by her primary care physician. She reports no fevers or chills but complains of increasing pain in her leg along with redness and swelling extending up to her thigh area. Her vital signs are stable, except for a mild tachycardia at 102 beats per minute.
On examination, there is erythema extending from below her knee up to mid-thigh level on her left leg, which feels warm to touch compared to the right side; there is tenderness on palpation over this area without crepitus or fluctuance noted.
What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Start intravenous antibiotics and admit to hospital 
B. Perform an MRI of the affected leg
C. Discharge with oral antibiotics and close follow-up 
D. Incision and drainage of any fluctuant area 
E. Obtain blood cultures

Explanation: The patient has worsening cellulitis despite treatment with oral antibiotics, which suggests that she may have a more severe infection or resistant organism requiring intravenous antibiotics and admission to the hospital.

Question
A 60-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for elective surgery for a hernia repair. He has no significant past medical history except for hypertension controlled on medications.
On postoperative day two, he develops fever, chills, and rigors along with increasing pain at the surgical site. On examination, there is erythema extending from below his umbilicus up to mid-abdomen level; there is tenderness on palpation over this area without crepitus or fluctuance noted.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Ventilator-associated pneumonia
B. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection 
C. Central line-associated bloodstream infection 
D. Surgical site infection 
E. Clostridium difficile colitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient has developed signs of a surgical site infection (SSI) including fever, chills, rigors, and localized erythema and tenderness around the incision site after surgery. This requires prompt evaluation by wound inspection and possible debridement as well as initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics covering common skin flora such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes until culture results are available to guide targeted therapy if needed.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to the clinic with a history of recurrent oral thrush and persistent diarrhea for the past 6 months. He denies any significant weight loss or fever but reports feeling fatigued. His medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which was diagnosed 2 years ago, and he has been on antiretroviral therapy since then. On examination, there are white plaques on his tongue that can be scraped off easily, and diffuse abdominal tenderness is noted.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cryptosporidiosis
B. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis
C. Kaposi sarcoma
D. Tuberculosis enteritis
E. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests an opportunistic infection in a person living with HIV who is already on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The presence of oral thrush and diarrhea raises suspicion for an underlying gastrointestinal infection such as MAC disease, which commonly affects patients with low CD4 counts despite ART.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of fatigue, night sweats, and swollen lymph nodes in her neck for the past month. She also reports having unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners over the past year and has recently noticed some vaginal discharge and itching.
Which test should be ordered first? 

A. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing
B. Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)
C. Gonorrhea culture
D. Syphilis serology
E. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening test

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms raise concern for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV infection. However, the presence of night sweats and lymphadenopathy suggests a possible systemic illness such as HIV. Therefore, an HIV screening test should be ordered first to rule out or confirm this diagnosis before proceeding with further STI testing.

Question
A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of recurrent fever, cough, and weight loss for the past 6 months. He also reports having several episodes of diarrhea and oral thrush during this time. His medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection diagnosed 10 years ago, for which he has been on antiretroviral therapy (ART). On examination, there are bilateral crackles in his lung bases.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
B. Tuberculosis
C. Cryptosporidiosis
D. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis
E. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary disease

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation raises suspicion for an opportunistic infection in a person living with HIV who is already on ART but has poor immune function due to advanced disease or non-adherence to treatment. The presence of respiratory symptoms and lung findings suggest a possible pulmonary infection such as MAC disease, which commonly affects patients with low CD4 counts despite ART.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with persistent genital warts despite multiple treatments. She has a history of sexual abuse and is currently in an abusive relationship. On examination, you note extensive genital warts on the vulva and perianal area. Which of the following HPV strains is most commonly associated with this presentation? Additionally, what are some potential barriers to successful treatment for this patient?

A. HPV 6
B. HPV 11
C. HPV 16
D. HPV 18
E. HPV 31

Question
A 30-year-old male presents with complaints of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain for the past few months along with diarrhea on eating fatty foods.
On examination, he has no significant findings except for a mild tenderness over his abdomen.
His laboratory investigations reveal serum total cholesterol level -8mmol/l, LDL-C -6mmol/l, HDL-C -1mmol/l, Triglycerides -3mmol/l.
Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for these findings? 

A. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency
B. Apo B-100 deficiency
C. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency
D. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency 
E. Niemann-Pick disease type C

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical features and laboratory investigations are suggestive of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency which leads to elevated levels of chylomicrons and triglycerides in blood causing pancreatitis as well as hepatosplenomegaly in severe cases due to deposition of lipid-laden macrophages in liver and spleen tissues respectively.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with altered mental status and dehydration. His blood glucose level is found to be significantly elevated, and his serum osmolality is also high. The patient's medical history reveals that he has been taking metformin for several years.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state? 

A. Diabetic ketoacidosis
B. Acute pancreatitis 
C. Lactic acidosis 
D. Metformin-induced lactic acidosis 
E. Hyperthyroidism

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of metformin therapy in patients with renal impairment or other risk factors such as hypoxia, sepsis, or liver disease. MALA can present similarly to hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), with symptoms including altered mental status, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. However, unlike HHS, MALA is characterized by an elevated lactate level and metabolic acidosis rather than hyperglycemia.

Question
A 60-year-old woman with a long-standing history of type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with confusion and weakness. She reports having had diarrhea for several days prior to admission and has not been able to keep any food down due to nausea and vomiting.

Which of the following laboratory findings would be expected in this patient? 

A. Hypokalemia 
B. Hyperkalemia 
C. Hyponatremia 
D. Hypernatremia 
E. Hypophosphatemia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients with hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), hyponatremia is commonly seen due to the osmotic shift of water from the intracellular space to the extracellular space. This leads to dilutional hyponatremia, which can cause confusion and other neurological symptoms.

Question
A 35-year-old man with a history of type 1 diabetes presents to the emergency department with severe dehydration and altered mental status. His blood glucose level is found to be significantly elevated, and he has an increased serum osmolality.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. IV insulin 
B. SC insulin 
C. Oral hypoglycemic agents 
D. Potassium supplements 
E. IV fluids

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The initial management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) involves aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline or Ringer's lactate solution to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Insulin therapy should also be initiated, but it is important to first ensure adequate hydration before starting insulin infusion to avoid worsening electrolyte imbalances or cerebral edema.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She has a past medical history of chronic kidney disease stage 5 and is on hemodialysis three times a week. On examination, she has tenderness in the epigastric region. Blood tests reveal:

Calcium 3.8 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)
Phosphate 0.9 mmol/L (0.74-1.40)
Parathyroid Hormone 120 pmol/L (1.6-6.9)
Alkaline Phosphatase 500 u/L (60-350)

What is the most likely diagnosis? What are the potential complications? How would you manage this patient? 

A) Primary hyperparathyroidism
B) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
C) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
D) Paraneoplastic syndrome 
E) Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The high levels of parathyroid hormone suggest secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease, which can lead to calcium deposition in soft tissues such as the pancreas causing acute pancreatitis leading to abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Other potential complications include renal osteodystrophy, cardiovascular disease and calciphylaxis among others.

Management involves treating the underlying cause of CKD while also managing serum calcium and phosphate levels through medications such as vitamin D analogs or calcimimetics.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with fatigue, muscle weakness, constipation and depression for several months duration.He has no significant past medical history but reports that his father had a similar condition before he passed away at age 50.On examination,his blood pressure is normal but there is mild proximal muscle weakness.Blood tests reveal:
Calcium - 3.4 mmol/L (2.1-2.6)
Phosphate - 0.8 mmol/L (0.8-1.4)
Magnesium - 0.9 mmol/L (0.7-1.0)
Parathyroid hormone - 95 pg/mL (14-65)

What is the most likely diagnosis? What further investigations would you perform? How would you manage this patient? 

A) Primary hyperparathyroidism
B) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
C) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
D) Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia 
E) Paraneoplastic syndrome

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The high calcium levels and normal parathyroid hormone levels suggest familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene which leads to decreased urinary excretion of calcium.

Further investigations may include genetic testing for confirmation and screening of family members.

Management involves monitoring serum calcium levels regularly and avoiding unnecessary interventions such as surgery or medications that can lower serum calcium levels.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent kidney stones over the past year.She has no significant past medical history but reports taking large doses of vitamin D supplements for several years.On examination,blood pressure is normal.Blood tests reveal:
Calcium - 3.5 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)
Phosphate - 1.1 mmol/L (0.74-1.40)
Parathyroid hormone - <10 pmol/L (1.6-6.9)

What is the most likely diagnosis? What are the potential complications? How would you manage this patient? 

A) Primary hyperparathyroidism
B) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
C) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
D) Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia 
E) Vitamin D toxicity

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The high calcium levels and low parathyroid hormone levels suggest vitamin D toxicity, which can lead to hypercalcemia and kidney stones among other complications.

Management involves stopping the intake of vitamin D supplements and monitoring serum calcium levels regularly. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required for hydration and treatment with medications such as bisphosphonates or calcitonin to lower serum calcium levels.

A 25-year-old female is brought to the ED by her friends after they found her unconscious in her apartment. She has a history of depression and was recently started on sertraline therapy by her psychiatrist.
On arrival, she is unresponsive with a GCS score of 3/15; core body temperature is measured at 40°C; pulse rate is elevated at 130 bpm; blood pressure is low at 80/50 mmHg.

Which of the following would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Administering naloxone
B. Initiating haemodialysis
C. Starting intravenous fluids containing dextrose
D. Giving antipyretics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen 
E. Administering flumazenil

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient presents with hyperthermia due to serotonin syndrome which can be caused by an overdose or interaction between serotonergic medications such as sertraline and other drugs that increase serotonin levels in the brain. The definitive treatment for serotonin syndrome is discontinuation of offending agents and administration of benzodiazepines or cyproheptadine to control agitation and muscle rigidity respectively. Flumazenil may also be used in cases where benzodiazepines are ineffective or contraindicated.

Question
A 45-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department (ED) with confusion and disorientation. She has no recollection of the events leading up to her presentation, but her husband reports that she had been complaining of dizziness and sweating earlier in the day. Her capillary blood glucose level is found to be 1.8mmol/L.
What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? Should she be given oral or intravenous glucose? What are the potential complications associated with each route? How should her blood glucose levels be monitored after treatment?

A. Oral glucose
B. Intravenous glucose
C. Both oral and intravenous glucose
D. No intervention required
E. Glucagon injection

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients presenting with severe hypoglycaemia, intravenous administration of glucose is preferred over oral administration due to its rapid onset of action and ability to ensure adequate delivery of glucose to the brain. However, there are potential complications associated with intravenous glucose administration such as thrombophlebitis, infection at injection site, fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances etc., which need to be considered while managing these patients.

Question
A 50-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to his GP complaining of recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia despite reducing his insulin dose as advised by his healthcare provider. He also complains of excessive sweating during these episodes along with palpitations and tremors.
What could be the possible causes for his recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes? What investigations would you order? How can he prevent future episodes? 

A. Insulinoma
B. Addison's disease 
C. Cushing's syndrome 
D. Pheochromocytoma 
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes in a patient with diabetes mellitus could be due to various causes such as insulinoma, Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma etc. Investigations such as serum cortisol levels, plasma metanephrines and catecholamines, insulin levels etc., may be required to identify the underlying cause of recurrent hypoglycaemia. Prevention strategies include regular monitoring of blood glucose levels, adjusting medication doses based on physical activity and dietary intake, educating patients about early recognition of symptoms and appropriate management.

Question
A 30-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes presents to the ED with seizures. She was found unresponsive by her family members who reported that she had missed her last meal and did not take her insulin dose as scheduled. Her capillary blood glucose level is found to be 2mmol/L.
What are the potential complications associated with prolonged hypoglycaemia? How should this patient be managed? What long-term measures can be taken to prevent future episodes? 

A. Brain damage
B. Cardiac arrhythmias 
C. Seizures 
D. All of the above 
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Prolonged hypoglycaemia can lead to serious complications such as brain damage, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures etc., which need prompt intervention to prevent further deterioration in the patient's condition. In this case, intravenous administration of glucose along with close monitoring of vital signs and neurological status would be necessary for immediate management of seizures caused by hypoglycaemia. Long-term measures include regular monitoring of blood glucose levels, education about appropriate dosing schedules and lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to prevent future episodes of hypoglycaemia.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with a history of seizures and muscle cramps. She has been diagnosed with hypoparathyroidism and is currently on calcium and vitamin D supplements. On examination, she has positive Chvostek's sign and Trousseau's sign. Her serum calcium level is 1.8 mmol/L, phosphate level is 2.4 mmol/L, and PTH level is <1 pmol/L.

Which one of the following statements about her condition is correct? 

A. Hypoparathyroidism can be caused by autoimmune disorders
B. Hypoparathyroidism can cause hypercalciuria
C. The patient should be started on bisphosphonates to prevent osteoporosis
D. The patient should avoid foods high in phosphorus
E. The patient requires surgery to remove the parathyroid gland

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Hypoparathyroidism can be caused by autoimmune disorders such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I (APS-I) or isolated autoimmune hypoparathyroidism (IAH). Hypercalciuria is not a feature of hypoparathyroidism but rather seen in hyperparathyroidism. Bisphosphonates are not indicated for treatment of hypoparathyroidism-related osteoporosis as they may further decrease serum calcium levels. Foods high in phosphorus do not need to be avoided completely but should be limited in patients with chronic kidney disease who have secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with fatigue, muscle weakness, and numbness around his mouth that worsens when he eats citrus fruits or drinks orange juice. He was previously diagnosed with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism and takes daily calcium carbonate tablets along with calcitriol capsules twice daily.

Which one of the following laboratory findings is most likely? 

A. Low serum calcium, high serum phosphate, and low PTH
B. High serum calcium, low serum phosphate, and high PTH
C. Low serum calcium, normal serum phosphate, and low PTH
D. Normal serum calcium, high serum phosphate, and normal PTH
E. High serum calcium, high serum phosphate, and low PTH

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism despite treatment with oral calcium supplements and calcitriol capsules. In idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, there is a decrease in parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion leading to decreased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium resulting in hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with seizures and muscle cramps for the past week. She has a history of thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma 10 years ago but was lost to follow-up after surgery. On examination, she has positive Chvostek's sign and Trousseau's sign. Her laboratory investigations reveal a corrected total calcium level of 1.6 mmol/L (normal range 2.1-2.6 mmol/L), magnesium level of 0.8 mmol/L (normal range 0.7-1 mmol/L), phosphorus level of 3 mmol/L (normal range 0.8-1.5 mmol/L), alkaline phosphatase level of 120 U/L (normal range <130 U/L), and intact PTH level of <1 pmol/L (normal range 1-7 pmol/L).

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Hypomagnesemia
B. Hypophosphatemia 
C. Hyperparathyroidism 
D. Hypoparathyroidism 
E. Vitamin D deficiency

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history of thyroidectomy and laboratory findings are suggestive of hypoparathyroidism, a condition characterized by low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) leading to hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia. Hypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia but is unlikely in this case as the magnesium level is within normal limits. Hypophosphatemia would not cause hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism would result in high PTH levels rather than low levels seen in this patient. Vitamin D deficiency can also lead to hypocalcemia but the intact PTH level would be elevated due to secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of splenectomy due to trauma presents to the Emergency Department with fever, chills, and abdominal pain. Blood tests reveal leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. CT scan shows multiple hypodense lesions in the liver and spleen. The patient is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for this presentation? 

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Haemophilus influenzae
C. Neisseria meningitidis
D. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi
E. Yersinia enterocolitica

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Patients who have undergone splenectomy are at increased risk of infection by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, among others. However, they are also at higher risk of non-encapsulated bacterial infections such as Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi which can cause typhoid fever-like symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and sometimes rash.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of fatigue and recurrent infections over the past few months since undergoing splenectomy due to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Physical examination reveals mild jaundice and an enlarged liver but no other significant findings. Laboratory studies show elevated bilirubin levels and decreased haptoglobin levels but normal platelet count.
Which one of the following complications is most likely responsible for these findings? 

A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia 
B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation 
C. Graft-versus-host disease 
D. Hepatic abscess 
E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Patients who have undergone splenectomy are at increased risk of developing autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to the loss of spleen's function in removing senescent red blood cells from circulation. AIHA can present with symptoms such as fatigue, jaundice, and recurrent infections due to decreased levels of haptoglobin and elevated bilirubin levels.

Question
A 27-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a routine check-up. He has a history of sickle cell disease and underwent splenectomy at the age of 10 years due to repeated episodes of splenic sequestration crises.

Which one of the following complications is most likely responsible for these findings? 

A. Iron deficiency anemia 
B. Megaloblastic anemia 
C. Myelodysplastic syndrome 
D. Parvovirus B19 infection 
E. Hyposplenism 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Splenectomy leads to hyposplenism which increases the risk of bacterial infections, particularly by encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis among others. Additionally, hyposplenism can cause Howell-Jolly bodies to appear on peripheral smear due to decreased removal of nuclear remnants from circulating erythrocytes by the spleen.

Question

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of watery diarrhoea for the past two weeks, which has been associated with crampy abdominal pain and occasional vomiting. He reports having recently returned from a trip to Africa where he consumed street food.

On examination, he appears dehydrated with dry mucous membranes and reduced skin turgor. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.8°C, heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute.

What is the most likely causative organism?

A. Vibrio cholerae
B. Cryptosporidium parvum
C. Entamoeba histolytica
D. Rotavirus
E. Norovirus

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's travel history and symptoms suggest an infectious cause of diarrhoea, which is commonly associated with consuming contaminated food or water in developing countries such as Africa. The presence of watery diarrhoea along with dehydration and reduced skin turgor suggests severe disease caused by Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite that causes amoebic dysentery.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a fever, sore throat and fatigue for the past week. He reports having unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the last month. On examination, he has bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and an enlarged spleen. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear. The patient is diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis.
Which of the following complications is most likely to occur in this patient? 

A. Acute renal failure
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Myocarditis
D. Guillain-Barre syndrome
E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Infectious mononucleosis can cause myocarditis due to direct viral invasion or autoimmune mechanisms leading to inflammation of the heart muscle. Patients may present with chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, or arrhythmias.

Question
A 30-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of persistent fatigue and malaise for several months despite adequate rest and sleep hygiene measures. She also reports intermittent low-grade fevers, night sweats, and generalized body aches without any significant weight loss or lymphadenopathy.
On further questioning, she reveals that she had an episode of infectious mononucleosis six months ago which resolved spontaneously after two weeks.
What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Start antiviral therapy 
B. Perform a complete blood count (CBC)
C. Refer for psychiatric evaluation 
D. Order imaging studies of the brain 
E. Prescribe antibiotics

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Persistent fatigue after infectious mononucleosis is common but usually resolves within three to six months without any specific intervention; however, some patients may develop chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). CBC should be performed to rule out other causes of fatigue such as anemia, thyroid dysfunction or autoimmune disorders.

Question
A 20-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a fever, sore throat and difficulty swallowing for the past week. He has no significant past medical history and is not on any medications. On examination, he has bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and an enlarged spleen. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear. The patient is diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis.
Which of the following laboratory findings is most likely to be seen in this patient? 

A. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
B. Positive rheumatoid factor
C. Decreased serum albumin levels 
D. Increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels
E. Positive heterophile antibody test

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Heterophile antibodies are produced during acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes infectious mononucleosis; therefore, a positive heterophile antibody test is highly suggestive of EBV infection. Other laboratory abnormalities may include mild leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases but not ESR, CRP or rheumatoid factor elevation or hypoalbuminemia.

Question
A 45-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presents to the emergency department with fever, chills, and fatigue. On examination, he has a temperature of 39°C and a heart rate of 110 bpm. Blood cultures are taken, and empiric antibiotic therapy is started. The patient's blood cultures grow Streptococcus bovis after 48 hours.

Which additional investigation should be performed in this patient? 

A. Echocardiogram
B. CT scan of the chest
C. MRI of the brain
D. Lumbar puncture 
E. PET-CT scan

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious infection that affects the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Patients who present with symptoms suggestive of IE require prompt diagnosis and management to prevent complications such as sepsis, embolic events or valve damage. In patients with suspected IE, an echocardiogram is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any valvular abnormalities or vegetations that may require surgical intervention.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents to her GP complaining of malaise, night sweats, and weight loss over several weeks duration. She has no significant past medical history but reports recent dental work done two months ago at her local dentist clinic.

On examination, she appears pale and unwell with a temperature of 38°C and a heart rate of 90 bpm.
Blood tests reveal normocytic anaemia, raised inflammatory markers (CRP), negative rheumatoid factor test results but positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA).

What is the most likely cause for this patient’s presentation? 

A. Rheumatoid arthritis
B. Systemic lupus erythematosus
C. Endocarditis
D. Malignancy 
E. Sjogren syndrome

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE) which can occur as a result of dental procedures or other invasive medical procedures. Patients with IE may present with non-specific symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss and night sweats. Blood cultures should be taken in all patients with suspected IE to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Question
A 30-year-old male presents to his GP complaining of a sore throat for the past week. He has no significant past medical history but reports recent travel to South-East Asia where he indulged in unprotected sexual activity.

On examination, he appears well with no signs of systemic illness. His temperature is normal, and there are no palpable lymph nodes on neck examination.
Blood tests reveal raised inflammatory markers (CRP), negative rheumatoid factor test results but positive serology for Chlamydia trachomatis.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute tonsillitis
B. Infectious mononucleosis 
C. Syphilis
D. Gonorrhoea pharyngitis 
E. Endocarditis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Although rare, sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia can cause infective endocarditis (IE). In this case, the patient's recent travel history coupled with high-risk behaviour increases his risk for developing IE from an STI acquired during his travels. An echocardiogram should be performed to assess for any valvular abnormalities that may require surgical intervention in addition to starting empiric antibiotic therapy while awaiting blood culture results.

Question
A 42-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a painful, red left eye and decreased vision for the past two days. She reports wearing contact lenses for extended periods of time without proper cleaning or disinfection. On examination, there is circumcorneal injection, corneal edema, and an epithelial defect with feathery borders on fluorescein staining. There is also a dense stromal infiltrate with overlying hypopyon in the anterior chamber. Gram stain reveals gram-positive cocci.

Which one of the following is the most likely causative organism? 

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Staphylococcus aureus
C. Haemophilus influenzae 
D. Moraxella catarrhalis 
E. Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presentation is consistent with bacterial keratitis due to contact lens wear, which can be caused by various organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, among others. Gram-positive cocci seen on Gram stain suggest S.aureus as the most likely culprit.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents to his optometrist complaining of pain and redness in his right eye that started after swimming in a public pool three days ago. He has no history of contact lens use or trauma to the eye. On examination, there is diffuse conjunctival injection and mild corneal edema with multiple small epithelial defects on fluorescein staining.

Which one of the following is true regarding this condition? 

A. It is usually caused by bacteria.
B. It typically presents with a large central corneal ulcer.
C. It requires immediate referral for surgical intervention.
D. It may be associated with exposure to contaminated water sources.
E. It is usually treated with topical antiviral medication.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of viral keratitis, which can be caused by various viruses including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and adenovirus. In this case, the history of swimming in a public pool suggests exposure to contaminated water sources as a possible cause. Treatment depends on the underlying etiology but may include supportive measures such as lubricants or antiviral medications if appropriate.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his ophthalmologist with pain, redness, and decreased vision in his left eye for the past week. He reports using contact lenses intermittently without proper cleaning or disinfection.

Which one of the following is true regarding this condition? 

A. It is typically caused by bacteria.
B. It requires immediate referral for surgical intervention.
C. It may be associated with exposure to contaminated water sources.
D. It is usually treated with topical corticosteroids.
E. It is most commonly caused by herpes simplex virus type 1.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presentation is consistent with herpes simplex keratitis, which can present as dendritic ulcers on fluorescein staining and is often associated with a history of contact lens use or previous episodes of herpetic infection. Treatment includes antiviral therapy such as acyclovir or valacyclovir and topical steroids may be used judiciously in certain cases under close supervision by an ophthalmologist due to potential risks of exacerbating viral replication or causing secondary infections.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a history of chronic abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and weight loss. She has been previously diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease but her symptoms have not improved despite treatment with steroids and immunosuppressants. Further investigations reveal that she has developed strictures in her small intestine, and imaging studies show deep ulcers in the ileum. The patient is referred for surgery to remove the affected portion of the bowel.

Which of the following surgical procedures would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Ileostomy
B. Colectomy
C. Proctocolectomy 
D. Strictureplasty 
E. Hartmann's procedure

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In patients with Crohn's disease who develop strictures in their small intestine, strictureplasty may be performed as an alternative to resection if there are multiple or long segments involved or if there is insufficient length of healthy bowel remaining after resection.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents with bloody diarrhoea and crampy abdominal pain that has persisted for several weeks.

A. Absence of free air in the abdomen
B. Presence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy 
C. Thickening of the bowel wall 
D. Dilated small bowel loops 
E. Presence of peritoneal fluid

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of dilated small bowel loops on imaging suggests that there is an obstruction in the intestine that may require surgical intervention if it does not resolve with conservative measures such as nasogastric decompression or intravenous fluids.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a high-grade fever, cough, and shortness of breath. She has no significant past medical history but reports that she had contact with her colleague who was recently diagnosed with influenza. On examination, she is tachypneic and hypoxic. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.

Which one of the following is true regarding the diagnosis of influenza? 

A. Rapid antigen testing for influenza virus is highly sensitive and specific.
B. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for influenza virus should be performed in all suspected cases.
C. Serological testing for influenza antibodies is recommended in patients presenting within 48 hours of symptom onset.
D. The use of antiviral therapy is not recommended in patients with uncomplicated influenza infection.
E. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy increases the risk of adverse fetal outcomes.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Rapid antigen tests have low sensitivity and specificity and may miss up to half of the cases of influenza infection. PCR testing has higher sensitivity and specificity than rapid antigen tests and can detect viral RNA even after the resolution of symptoms.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and feverishness for the past week. He also reports a dry cough that started a few days ago. His medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus which are well controlled on medications.

Which one of the following is true regarding this patient? 

A. He should receive oseltamivir as soon as possible without waiting for confirmatory diagnostic tests.
B. He should receive antibiotics empirically due to his comorbidities.
C. He does not require any further investigations or treatment at present as he likely has a self-limiting viral illness.
D. He should undergo chest radiography to rule out pneumonia.
E. He should be admitted to hospital for further management.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of influenza infection and is at increased risk of complications due to his comorbidities. Antiviral therapy with oseltamivir should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset, without waiting for confirmatory diagnostic tests.

Question
A 25-year-old woman who is 20 weeks pregnant presents to her obstetrician complaining of fever, cough, and sore throat for the past two days. She has no significant past medical history but reports that she had contact with her colleague who was recently diagnosed with influenza.

Which one of the following is true regarding this patient? 

A. She should receive antiviral therapy only if she develops severe respiratory distress or hypoxia.
B. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is contraindicated due to potential harm to the fetus.
C. Oseltamivir is safe in pregnancy and can be used for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza infection.
D. The use of aspirin is recommended for fever control in pregnant women with suspected or confirmed influenza infection.
E. Maternal influenza infection does not increase the risk of adverse fetal outcomes such as preterm birth or low birth weight.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Pregnant women are at increased risk of complications from influenza infection and should receive prompt antiviral therapy if they develop symptoms suggestive of influenza infection, regardless of their vaccination status. Oseltamivir is safe in pregnancy and can reduce the severity and duration of illness when started early. Aspirin should be avoided in pregnancy due to its association with Reye syndrome in children under 16 years old. Maternal influenza infection may increase the risk of adverse fetal outcomes such as preterm birth or low birth weight.

Explanation: The patient's history of endometriosis puts her at risk for developing adhesions which can lead to small bowel obstruction as seen on clinical findings.

Question
A 6-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department by his parents with a history of vomiting, abdominal pain and lethargy for the past 2 days. The baby has passed bloody stools twice in the last 24 hours. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. An ultrasound scan shows an intussusception with no signs of bowel perforation or obstruction.
Which one of the following is true regarding this condition? 

A. Intussusception is more common in girls than boys
B. The most common type of intussusception is ileocolic
C. Ultrasound scan is not useful in diagnosing intussusception
D. Surgery is always required to treat intussusception 
E. Intussusception can be caused by inflammatory bowel disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Intussusception occurs when one segment of intestine telescopes into another, causing bowel obstruction and ischemia due to compromised blood supply to that portion of intestine. It commonly affects infants between 3 months and 1 year old, with males being affected more often than females (option A is incorrect). Ileocolic intussusception accounts for about 75% of cases (option B is correct). Ultrasound scan has high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing intussusception (option C is incorrect). Non-surgical reduction using air enema or barium enema can be attempted as first-line treatment if there are no signs of bowel perforation or obstruction; surgery may be required if non-surgical reduction fails or complications arise (option D is incorrect). Inflammatory bowel disease does not cause intussusception (option E is incorrect).

Question
A 4-year-old boy presents to the paediatric clinic with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain over the past few weeks associated with vomiting and diarrhoea. The child appears pale and lethargic on examination, with a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. An ultrasound scan shows an intussusception with no signs of bowel perforation or obstruction.
Which one of the following is true regarding this condition? 

A. Intussusception is rare in children over 2 years old
B. Abdominal X-ray is the gold standard for diagnosing intussusception 
C. Intestinal polyps are a common cause of intussusception in older children
D. Non-surgical reduction using air enema has a high success rate in older children
E. Recurrence of intussusception is uncommon after successful non-surgical reduction

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: While intussusception is most commonly seen in infants between 3 months and 1 year old, it can occur at any age (option A is incorrect). Ultrasound scan is preferred over abdominal X-ray as it has higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing intussusception (option B is incorrect). In older children, intestinal polyps or other underlying pathology may be responsible for causing intussusception (option C is correct). Non-surgical reduction using air enema may have lower success rates in older children due to factors such as increased risk of bowel perforation or adhesions (option D is incorrect). Recurrence of intussusception after successful non-surgical reduction can occur in up to 10% of cases (option E is incorrect).

Question
A previously healthy 8-month-old girl presents to the emergency department with sudden onset severe colicky abdominal pain associated with vomiting and bloody diarrhoea. On examination, there are signs of dehydration and shock, with a palpable sausage-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. An urgent laparotomy reveals necrotic bowel secondary to an ileocolic intussusception.
Which one of the following is true regarding this condition? 

A. Intussusception is a common cause of bowel obstruction in adults
B. The most common complication of intussusception is bowel perforation 
C. Surgery is not required in cases of necrotic bowel due to intussusception
D. Mortality rate for untreated intussusception can be as high as 50%
E. Recurrence of intussusception after surgical reduction is rare

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Intussusception is rare in adults and more commonly seen in infants and young children (option A is incorrect). Bowel perforation, intestinal haemorrhage or sepsis are potential complications of intussusception that may lead to significant morbidity and mortality (option B is incorrect). In cases where there has been prolonged ischemia or necrosis, surgery may be required to remove the affected portion of intestine (option C is incorrect). If left untreated, mortality rate for intussusception can be as high as 50% due to complications such as peritonitis or sepsis (option D is correct). Recurrence rates after surgical reduction vary but can occur in up to 10-15% of cases depending on underlying pathology (option E is incorrect).

Question

On examination, she appears pale with angular cheilitis and glossitis; there is also evidence of peripheral neuropathy with reduced vibration sense in both feet.
Laboratory investigations show microcytic anaemia with low serum iron levels; further tests reveal elevated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and decreased ferritin levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Scurvy
B. Pellagra 
C. Beriberi 
D. Iron-deficiency anemia 
E. Megaloblastic anemia

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Iron-deficiency anemia is a common type of malnutrition that results from inadequate dietary intake, poor absorption or increased loss of iron. The clinical features include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath on exertion, and difficulty swallowing solid foods due to the development of esophageal webs (Plummer-Vinson syndrome). Angular cheilitis and glossitis are also common findings in iron deficiency anemia.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of hair loss, brittle nails, dry skin, and recurrent infections over the past six months. She reports following a strict vegan diet for two years now and has lost significant weight during this period; she denies any other medical conditions or medications.
On examination, there is evidence of alopecia with thinning hair over the scalp; there are also multiple bruises on both arms and legs.

Which of the following vitamin deficiencies could explain these symptoms? 

A. Vitamin B12
B. Vitamin C 
C. Vitamin E 
D. Vitamin K 
E. Folic acid

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Vegan diets can be deficient in several essential nutrients including vitamin B12 which is found mainly in animal products such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia with neurological manifestations such as peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment as well as dermatological changes such as hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation of the skin along with hair loss and nail brittleness.

Question
A 12-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a high-grade fever, cough, and coryza for the past three days. She has developed a rash that started on her face and has spread to her trunk and extremities. On examination, she appears unwell with a temperature of 39°C, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. There is evidence of conjunctivitis and Koplik spots are seen on the buccal mucosa. Chest X-ray shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Blood tests reveal leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Kawasaki disease
B. Measles
C. Mumps
D. Parvovirus B19
E. Rubella

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with measles infection based on the presence of fever, cough, coryza, rash starting from the face and spreading downwards, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots on buccal mucosa, chest X-ray findings of bilateral interstitial infiltrates, and laboratory findings of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of fatigue, malaise, headache and joint pain for the past week along with a non-pruritic maculopapular rash that began on her forehead before spreading down to involve her trunk and limbs over several days.
On examination there was no significant lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly noted.
She reports having had two doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine as a child.
What is the most likely cause for this presentation? 

A. Primary rubella infection 
B. Secondary rubella infection 
C. Measles infection 
D. Mumps infection
E. Parvovirus B19 infection

Correct Answer: A 

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with primary rubella infection based on the presence of fatigue, malaise, headache and joint pain along with a non-pruritic maculopapular rash that began on her forehead before spreading down to involve her trunk and limbs over several days. The absence of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly makes measles less likely.

Question
A 6-month-old infant presents to the emergency department with fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis for the past three days followed by a generalized erythematous maculopapular rash that started on his face and has now spread to his trunk and extremities.
On examination, he appears unwell with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 160 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.
What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Administer intravenous antibiotics 
B. Administer oral antiviral medication 
C. Administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 
D. Isolate the patient in an airborne isolation room 
E. Provide supportive care including hydration and fever control 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with measles infection based on the presence of fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis and generalized erythematous maculopapular rash starting from face and spreading downwards. There is no indication for antibiotics or antivirals as measles is caused by a virus which does not respond to these medications. IVIG may be considered in severe cases but supportive care including hydration and fever control are the mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated cases of measles. Airborne isolation is not necessary as measles is spread by droplets.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with recurrent episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss in his left ear. The symptoms last for several hours to a day and are often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He has noticed that these attacks occur more frequently when he is under stress or after consuming salty foods. On examination, there is evidence of sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear, but no other abnormalities are noted.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Ménière's disease
B. Vestibular schwannoma
C. Labyrinthitis ossificans
D. Superior canal dehiscence syndrome
E. Otosclerosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient’s symptoms are consistent with Ménière's disease, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo lasting from minutes to hours, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness or pressure in the affected ear(s). Stress and high salt intake can exacerbate the symptoms. Vestibular schwannoma may present with similar symptoms but would be associated with progressive rather than episodic hearing loss over time.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with sudden onset vertigo associated with nausea and vomiting that lasted for several days before resolving spontaneously. She reports experiencing occasional mild dizziness since then but denies any hearing loss or tinnitus. Examination reveals normal cranial nerves and gait; however, she has nystagmus on gaze testing towards her right side.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acoustic neuroma
B. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)
C. Labyrinthitis
D. Ménière's disease 
E.Vestibular migraine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This presentation suggests acute labyrinthitis as the cause of her initial episode of vertigo, which is characterized by sudden onset vertigo associated with nausea and vomiting. Nystagmus on gaze testing towards the affected side is a common finding in labyrinthitis. The absence of hearing loss or tinnitus makes Ménière's disease less likely.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with recurrent episodes of vertigo lasting several hours to a day, accompanied by fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus in his left ear. He reports that these attacks are often preceded by a feeling of fullness or pressure in his left ear. Examination reveals no abnormalities except for reduced hearing acuity in the left ear.

What is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Intratympanic gentamicin injection
B. Low-salt diet and diuretics
C. Oral corticosteroids 
D. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises 
E.Surgical intervention

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient’s symptoms are consistent with Ménière's disease, which can be managed conservatively initially with low-salt diet and diuretics to reduce endolymphatic fluid volume and pressure within the inner ear. Intratympanic gentamicin injection may be considered if medical therapy fails; however, it carries a risk of permanent hearing loss. Corticosteroids may be used during acute exacerbations but are not recommended as long-term therapy due to their potential adverse effects. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises can help improve balance function but do not address the underlying pathology of Ménière's disease itself. Surgical intervention may be considered in refractory cases but should only be performed after careful consideration of risks and benefits.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a severe headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, and fever. He reports feeling unwell for several days before the onset of these symptoms. On examination, he has a temperature of 39°C, heart rate of 110 beats/min, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 15/15.

A lumbar puncture is performed which shows an opening pressure of >30cm H2O. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals a white cell count of 5000 cells/mm3 (predominantly neutrophils), protein level of 1.5 g/L, and glucose level of 1.8 mmol/L.

Which one of the following organisms is the most likely cause of his meningitis? 

A. Haemophilus influenzae
B. Listeria monocytogenes
C. Streptococcus agalactiae 
D. Escherichia coli 
E. Neisseria meningitidis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation with severe headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, and fever along with elevated CSF white cell count predominantly composed of neutrophils suggests bacterial meningitis as opposed to viral or fungal causes. The high opening pressure indicates increased intracranial pressure due to inflammation in the meninges caused by bacteria entering through the bloodstream or direct extension from adjacent structures such as sinuses or ears.
The presence of Gram-negative rods on CSF gram stain supports E.coli as the causative organism which can be acquired via urinary tract infections especially in immunocompromised individuals.

Question
A previously healthy 25-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining about a mild headache that started yesterday but has now worsened. She also reports a fever, nausea, and vomiting. On examination, she is alert and oriented with no focal neurological deficits. Her vital signs are within normal limits.

A lumbar puncture is performed which shows an opening pressure of 18 cm H2O. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals a white cell count of 120 cells/mm3 (predominantly lymphocytes), protein level of 0.8 g/L, and glucose level of 4 mmol/L.

Which one of the following organisms is the most likely cause? 

A. Cryptococcus neoformans
B. Listeria monocytogenes 
C. Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
D. Varicella-zoster virus 
E. Enterovirus

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation with mild headache that progressed to severe along with fever, nausea, and vomiting suggests meningitis as opposed to encephalitis or other causes such as migraine or tension headaches.
The CSF findings indicate fungal meningitis rather than bacterial or viral etiology due to elevated lymphocyte count (>100 cells/mm3) and mildly elevated protein levels (<1g/L). Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of fungal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals especially those with HIV infection.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion, lethargy, photophobia, neck stiffness, and fever for two days before admission. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with inhalers but otherwise takes no medications.

On examination, he appears drowsy but responds appropriately to verbal stimuli only; his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 12/15. His vital signs reveal tachycardia at 110 beats/min and blood pressure at 150/90 mmHg. There is no focal neurological deficit.

A lumbar puncture is performed which shows an opening pressure of 25 cm H2O. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals a white cell count of 200 cells/mm3 (predominantly lymphocytes), protein level of 1.2 g/L, and glucose level of 2 mmol/L.

Which one of the following organisms is the most likely cause? 

A. Listeria monocytogenes 
B. Mycobacterium tuberculosis
C. Streptococcus pneumoniae 
D. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
E. Cryptococcus neoformans

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation with confusion, lethargy, photophobia, neck stiffness, and fever suggests meningitis or meningoencephalitis as opposed to other causes such as delirium or metabolic encephalopathy.
The CSF findings indicate fungal meningitis rather than bacterial or viral etiology due to elevated lymphocyte count (>100 cells/mm3) and mildly elevated protein levels (<1g/L). Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of fungal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals especially those with underlying lung disease like COPD.

Question
A 52-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of hot flushes, night sweats and vaginal dryness for the past year. She has a history of hypertension and is currently on medication for it. On examination, she has atrophic vaginal mucosa and no palpable ovaries. Her FSH levels are elevated. What is the most appropriate management option for this patient? 

A. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
B. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
C. Tibolone
D. Clonidine
E. Gabapentin

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's symptoms suggest that she is experiencing menopausal symptoms due to decreased estrogen levels in her body. The most appropriate management option would be selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene or tamoxifen which act on specific tissues to mimic the effects of estrogen without increasing the risk of endometrial cancer.

Question
A 56-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with recurrent episodes of urinary tract infections (UTIs). She reports having had three UTIs in the last six months alone, despite completing courses of antibiotics each time. Urine cultures show Escherichia coli growth sensitive to nitrofurantoin but resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin.
What is the most likely cause of recurrent UTIs in this patient? 

A. Atrophic vaginitis 
B. Urethral diverticulum 
C. Vesicoureteral reflux 
D. Bladder stone 
E. Interstitial cystitis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Recurrent UTIs in postmenopausal women can be attributed to atrophic vaginitis caused by decreased estrogen levels leading to changes in vaginal flora and pH which predispose them to bacterial overgrowth. Treatment with topical or systemic estrogen can help restore vaginal health and reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs.

Question
A 62-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of weight gain, fatigue and joint pain for the past year. She reports having gone through menopause at age 52 and has been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) since then. On examination, she has a BMI of 32 kg/m² and tender joints bilaterally. Investigations reveal elevated ESR and CRP levels.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Rheumatoid arthritis 
B. Osteoarthritis 
C. Polymyalgia rheumatica 
D. Fibromyalgia 
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica which commonly affects women over the age of 50 years who have gone through menopause. It presents with symmetrical proximal muscle pain, stiffness, fatigue and weight loss along with raised inflammatory markers such as ESR and CRP levels. HRT may delay onset or improve symptoms in some patients but treatment typically involves low-dose corticosteroids for several months to years depending on disease activity.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She reports a history of mesenteric adenitis that was diagnosed and treated two years ago.

C. Aortic stenosis
D. Tricuspid regurgitation
E. Infective endocarditis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest infective endocarditis involving the mitral valve due to his underlying risk factors such as atrial fibrillation and hypertension. The presence of a holosystolic murmur suggests significant valvular involvement, which may require urgent surgical intervention along with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Question
A 56-year-old man presents with a six-month history of progressive weakness in his arms and legs, along with difficulty swallowing and speaking. On examination, there is marked wasting of the upper limbs and tongue, fasciculations are present throughout, and there is spasticity in all four limbs. Electromyography (EMG) shows evidence of denervation in multiple muscle groups.

Which type of motor neurone disease is most likely to be responsible for this presentation? 

A. Progressive muscular atrophy 
B. Primary lateral sclerosis 
C. Spinal muscular atrophy 
D. Bulbar-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
E. Limb-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons, as well as bulbar muscles such as those involved in speech and swallowing. This pattern is consistent with bulbar-onset ALS, which typically progresses rapidly and has a poor prognosis.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a three-year history of gradually worsening weakness in her right hand, which has now spread to involve the left hand as well. She also reports occasional cramps and twitching in both hands that have become more frequent over time.

On examination, there is mild wasting of the thenar eminences bilaterally, along with fasciculations visible on inspection. Strength testing reveals reduced grip strength bilaterally but no other significant deficits.

What diagnosis should be considered? 

A. Monomelic amyotrophy 
B. Multifocal motor neuropathy 
C. Kennedy disease 
D. Benign fasciculation syndrome
E. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of limb-onset ALS, which typically begins asymmetrically with focal weakness or atrophy before spreading to involve other regions over time. The presence of fasciculations and mild atrophy in the thenar eminences supports this diagnosis.

Question
A 62-year-old man presents with a six-month history of progressive weakness in his legs, along with difficulty climbing stairs and getting up from a seated position. He also reports occasional cramps in both calves.

C. Cardiogenic shock
D. Hypovolemic shock 
E. Anaphylactic shock

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests septic shock which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome if not treated promptly.

Question
A 65-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents with shortness of breath, cough productive of purulent sputum, fever and malaise for the past week. On examination she has bilateral crackles on lung auscultation along with cyanosis and peripheral oedema. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Which of the following complications is she at risk of developing? 

A. Acute renal failure
B. Cardiac arrhythmias 
C. Pulmonary embolism
D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
E. Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient has severe pneumonia which can lead to sepsis, shock and subsequently multi-organ dysfunction syndrome if not treated promptly and aggressively.

Question
A 62-year-old man presents with severe back pain and is found to have multiple lytic lesions on radiographs. Further investigations reveal hypercalcaemia, anaemia, and renal impairment. Bone marrow biopsy shows a high proportion of plasma cells. The patient is started on chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma. However, during his treatment, he develops acute kidney injury (AKI) due to tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). Which one of the following medications should be given prophylactically to prevent TLS? 

A. Allopurinol
B. Furosemide
C. Sodium bicarbonate
D. Mannitol
E. Rasburicase

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase that converts uric acid into allantoin, which is more soluble and easily excreted by the kidneys. It is used as prophylaxis in patients at risk of developing TLS, such as those with multiple myeloma who are receiving chemotherapy.

Question
A 68-year-old woman presents with fatigue and bone pain for several months. She has no significant past medical history but reports recent weight loss and night sweats. Blood tests show normocytic anaemia, elevated creatinine levels, hypercalcemia, and monoclonal gammopathy on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP). Imaging studies reveal diffuse osteopenia with numerous lytic lesions throughout her skeleton consistent with multiple myeloma.
Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most useful in assessing disease activity? 

A. X-ray
B. CT scan
C. MRI
D. PET scan
E. Ultrasound

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are highly sensitive in detecting active sites of multiple myeloma because they can detect metabolic activity in the bone marrow. PET scans can be used to assess disease activity and response to treatment.

Question
A 72-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. CT scan reveals small bowel obstruction due to extrinsic compression by an enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node. The patient is started on chemotherapy for his multiple myeloma, but he develops acute kidney injury (AKI) during treatment.
Which one of the following medications should be avoided in this patient? 

A. Bortezomib
B. Lenalidomide
C. Cyclophosphamide
D. Dexamethasone
E. Doxorubicin

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Doxorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent that can cause nephrotoxicity and exacerbate AKI in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Therefore, it should be used with caution or avoided altogether in patients at risk of AKI, such as those with multiple myeloma who have renal impairment or are receiving other nephrotoxic agents.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents with a history of blurred vision in her left eye for the past week, followed by weakness and numbness in both legs over the next few days. She has no significant medical history but reports having had a cold recently. On examination, there is decreased visual acuity in the left eye, bilateral lower limb weakness, and sensory loss up to the level of T10 dermatome. MRI shows multiple white matter lesions scattered throughout the brain and spinal cord.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder 
B. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
C. Multiple sclerosis 
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus 
E. Sarcoidosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation along with imaging findings suggests that this patient has multiple sclerosis (MS). MS typically presents with optic neuritis followed by motor or sensory symptoms due to demyelination of nerve fibers in various parts of the central nervous system (CNS).

Question
A 50-year-old male presents with nephrotic syndrome and is found to have membranous glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient? The physician decides to start him on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins but his proteinuria persists despite maximal medical therapy. What are the next steps in management? 

A. Adding cyclosporine
B. Adding mycophenolate mofetil
C. Adding rituximab
D. Repeat renal biopsy
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Membranous glomerulonephritis is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be associated with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. ACE inhibitors and statins are first-line treatments for these patients due to their renoprotective effects and ability to reduce proteinuria. However, some patients may not respond adequately to medical therapy alone or may experience relapses after initial response. In such cases, adding immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil may be considered based on individual patient factors and disease severity. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets B cells, has also shown promising results in treating refractory cases of membranous glomerulonephritis. Repeat renal biopsy may be necessary if there is suspicion of disease progression or development of complications.

Question
A 30-year-old female presents with nephrotic syndrome secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). She has failed multiple courses of corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors over the past year and her renal function is declining. What are the next steps in management? The physician considers a trial of rituximab but is concerned about potential adverse effects and lack of long-term data. 

A. Adding mycophenolate mofetil
B. Adding cyclophosphamide
C. Plasmapheresis
D. Renal transplant evaluation
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: FSGS is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be difficult to treat, especially in cases that are refractory to standard therapies such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. In such cases, adding other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide may be considered based on individual patient factors and disease severity. Plasmapheresis may also be used as an adjunctive therapy in some cases, particularly those with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis or severe proteinuria. However, renal transplant remains the definitive treatment for end-stage kidney disease due to FSGS, with excellent long-term outcomes reported in carefully selected patients.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of nephrotic syndrome over the past year despite multiple courses of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. He has no significant medical history and family history is negative for kidney disease. Renal biopsy reveals minimal change disease (MCD). What are the possible underlying causes of MCD? The physician decides to start him on high-dose prednisolone but he experiences significant side effects including weight gain, mood changes, and insomnia.

A. Viral infections
B. Medications (NSAIDs, lithium)
C. Malignancies (lymphoma)
D. Autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus)
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: MCD is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and young adults, characterized by diffuse podocyte foot process effacement on electron microscopy. The underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood but may involve T-cell dysfunction and cytokine dysregulation. In many cases, no specific underlying cause can be identified (idiopathic MCD). However, certain viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus and hepatitis B/C have been implicated in some cases, as well as medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and lithium. Rarely, malignancies such as lymphoma or autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus may present with features of MCD. High-dose corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for MCD but can be associated with significant side effects, particularly with prolonged use.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to his GP with a persistent cough and shortness of breath for the past year. He works in a factory that produces fiberglass insulation, where he has been employed for the past 20 years. His symptoms have worsened over the past few months, and he reports occasional chest pain as well. On examination, there are crackles heard on auscultation of both lungs.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
B. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
C. Mesothelioma
D. Silicosis
E. Pulmonary embolism

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's history of exposure to fiberglass insulation suggests occupational lung disease as a possible cause of his symptoms. Fiberglass workers are at risk of developing hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to inhalation of small fibers which can trigger an immune response leading to inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs.

Question
A 60-year-old retired coal miner presents with dyspnea on exertion and chronic cough for several years now, which has progressively worsened over time despite treatment with bronchodilators and corticosteroids.

On examination, there are wheezes heard on auscultation bilaterally, and chest x-ray shows diffuse interstitial markings in both lungs.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Coal worker's pneumoconiosis
B. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
C. Bronchiectasis
D. Sarcoidosis
E. Tuberculosis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's history of working as a coal miner puts him at risk for developing coal worker's pneumoconiosis; however, his presentation with progressive dyspnea on exertion and chronic cough along with diffuse interstitial markings on chest x-ray suggest idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 45-year-old welder presents with a persistent cough and shortness of breath for several months now, which has worsened over time despite treatment with bronchodilators and corticosteroids. He reports occasional chest pain as well.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's occupation as a welder puts him at risk for developing lung diseases such as silicosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis; however, his presentation with progressive dyspnea on exertion and chronic cough along with diffuse interstitial markings on chest x-ray suggest asbestosis as the most likely diagnosis due to exposure to asbestos during welding activities.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of progressive dysphagia for solids and liquids, weight loss, and chest pain that radiates to the back. He has a past medical history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and is an ex-smoker. On examination, he appears cachectic, and there are no palpable lymph nodes or hepatosplenomegaly. An upper GI endoscopy reveals a circumferential lesion in the middle third of the oesophagus extending into the submucosa; biopsies confirm squamous cell carcinoma.

Which one of the following is true regarding this patient? 

A. The most common location for squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus is at its junction with the stomach.
B. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 50% of all oesophageal cancers in Western countries.
C. Patients with GORD have an increased risk of developing adenocarcinoma rather than squamous cell carcinoma.
D. Oesophageal cancer commonly metastasizes to bone before spreading to other organs.
E. Treatment options for this patient include surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 25-30% of all oesophageal cancers in Western countries, while adenocarcinoma accounts for around 50%. The most common location for squamous cell carcinoma is in the upper two-thirds of the oesophagus, whereas adenocarcinoma usually arises from Barrett's oesophagus in the lower third of the oesophagus. Oesophageal cancer commonly metastasizes to liver, lung, and lymph nodes before spreading to other organs. Treatment options depend on several factors such as tumour stage, location, histology type etc., but may include surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with dysphagia for solids that has been worsening over the past year. He also reports a persistent cough and hoarseness of voice. On examination, there is cervical lymphadenopathy, but no hepatosplenomegaly or palpable abdominal masses. An upper GI endoscopy reveals an ulcerated mass in the distal oesophagus; biopsies confirm adenocarcinoma.

Which one of the following is true regarding this patient? 

A. The most common presenting symptom of oesophageal cancer is odynophagia.
B. Adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus is more common in men than women.
C. Oesophageal cancer commonly metastasizes to bone before spreading to other organs.
D. Treatment options for this patient include surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy only.
E. Barrett's oesophagus is not a risk factor for developing adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Dysphagia for solids is the most common presenting symptom of oesophageal cancer, followed by weight loss and chest pain. Adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus is more common in men than women, whereas squamous cell carcinoma shows a male predominance worldwide. Oesophageal cancer commonly metastasizes to liver, lung, and lymph nodes before spreading to other organs such as bone or brain. Treatment options depend on several factors such as tumour stage, location, histology type etc., but may include surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy if indicated. Barrett's oesophagus is a premalignant condition that increases the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with a history of dysphagia for solids and liquids, weight loss, and chest pain that radiates to the back. He has a past medical history of alcohol abuse and smoking. On examination, he appears cachectic, and there are palpable supraclavicular lymph nodes. An upper GI endoscopy reveals an irregular mass in the middle third of the oesophagus; biopsies confirm squamous cell carcinoma.

Which one of the following is true regarding this patient? 

A. The most common location for squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus is at its junction with the stomach.
B. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 50% of all oesophageal cancers in Western countries.
C. Patients with GORD have an increased risk of developing adenocarcinoma rather than squamous cell carcinoma.
D. Oesophageal cancer commonly metastasizes to bone before spreading to other organs.
E. Treatment options for this patient include palliative chemotherapy only.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The most common location for squamous cell carcinoma is in the upper two-thirds of the oesophagus, whereas adenocarcinoma usually arises from Barrett's oesophagus in the lower third of the oesophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 25-30% of all oesophageal cancers in Western countries, while adenocarcinoma accounts for around 50%. Patients with GORD have an increased risk of developing adenocarcinoma rather than squamous cell carcinoma. Oesophageal cancer commonly metastasizes to liver, lung, and lymph nodes before spreading to other organs such as bone or brain if left untreated or advanced stage disease. Treatment options depend on several factors such as tumour stage, location, histology type etc., but may include surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of these. Palliative chemotherapy alone is not the recommended treatment option for this patient.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the ophthalmology clinic with a sudden onset of vision loss in her left eye associated with pain on eye movement and red desaturations. On examination, visual acuity is reduced to 6/60 in the left eye and normal in the right. Colour vision is also affected in the left eye. There are no signs of optic disc swelling or pallor on fundoscopy, but there is evidence of peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickening on optical coherence tomography (OCT). The patient undergoes an MRI scan which shows multiple white matter lesions consistent with demyelination.
Which one of the following tests would be most useful for confirming the diagnosis? 

A. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis
B. Electroretinogram
C. Magnetic resonance angiography
D. Serum anti-aquaporin-4 antibody testing
E. Visual evoked potential testing

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This question requires knowledge about optic neuritis as a presenting feature of multiple sclerosis, and how it can be differentiated from other causes such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). The presence of peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickening on OCT suggests that this may be NMOSD rather than MS, so serum anti-aquaporin-4 antibody testing would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with a two-week history of blurred vision in his right eye associated with pain on eye movement and photophobia. He has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications. On examination, visual acuity is reduced to 6/24 in the right eye and normal in the left, with relative afferent pupillary defect noted on swinging torch test. Fundoscopy reveals mild optic disc swelling in the right eye. Blood tests are unremarkable, and the patient undergoes an MRI scan which shows no evidence of demyelination or other abnormalities.
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
B. Central retinal artery occlusion
C. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
D. Optic neuritis
E. Retinal detachment

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This question requires knowledge about idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) as a cause of optic disc swelling and visual loss, particularly in overweight women of childbearing age. The absence of demyelinating lesions on MRI makes MS-associated optic neuritis less likely, while acute angle-closure glaucoma would present with severe pain and nausea/vomiting rather than just photophobia.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP with a two-day history of sudden onset vision loss in her left eye associated with pain on eye movement and red desaturations. She has a past medical history significant for Crohn's disease treated with infliximab therapy for the last six months. On examination, visual acuity is reduced to 6/60 in the left eye and normal in the right, with mild optic disc swelling noted on fundoscopy. The patient undergoes an MRI scan which shows no evidence of demyelination or other abnormalities.
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute macular degeneration
B. Central serous chorioretinopathy
C. Drug-induced optic neuropathy
D. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy
E. Optic neuritis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This question requires knowledge about drug-induced optic neuropathies as potential side effects of certain medications such as infliximab used in treating autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease. The absence of demyelinating lesions on MRI makes MS-associated optic neuritis less likely, while acute macular degeneration and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy would present differently with different age groups and family history respectively.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents with a history of pain in her right knee that has been gradually worsening over the past year. She reports difficulty walking and standing for prolonged periods of time, as well as stiffness in the joint upon waking up in the morning. On examination, there is tenderness to palpation over the medial aspect of the joint line, as well as crepitus on passive range of motion testing. X-rays reveal significant narrowing of the joint space, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation.

Which one of the following is most likely to be associated with this patient's condition? 

A. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
B. Positive rheumatoid factor (RF)
C. Presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies
D. Joint effusion visible on X-ray
E. Synovial biopsy demonstrating lymphocytic infiltration

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Osteoarthritis typically presents with gradual onset pain and stiffness that worsens over time, often affecting weight-bearing joints such as knees and hips. Radiographic findings include joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation - all present in this case scenario. Unlike inflammatory arthropathies like rheumatoid arthritis or gout, osteoarthritis does not typically present with elevated ESR or positive serologic markers such as RF or anti-CCP antibodies; synovial biopsy would also not show evidence of lymphocytic infiltration unless there was an underlying inflammatory component.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with chronic bilateral hip pain that has been progressively worsening over several years despite conservative management measures including physical therapy and analgesic medications. He reports difficulty ambulating more than short distances without experiencing severe discomfort in his hips bilaterally.
On examination, there is limited range of motion in both hips, with pain on internal and external rotation. X-rays reveal significant joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation bilaterally.

Which one of the following is most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Total hip arthroplasty
B. Arthroscopic debridement
C. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection
D. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection
E. Acupuncture

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation and radiographic findings are consistent with end-stage osteoarthritis of the hips, which typically requires surgical intervention such as total hip arthroplasty to alleviate symptoms and improve function. Conservative measures may be attempted initially but are unlikely to provide long-term relief in advanced cases like this one; arthroscopy or intra-articular injections would not be effective given the extent of joint damage present.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with a history of chronic knee pain that has been ongoing for several years despite conservative management measures including physical therapy and analgesic medications. She reports difficulty ambulating more than short distances without experiencing severe discomfort in her right knee.
On examination, there is tenderness to palpation over the medial aspect of the joint line, as well as crepitus on passive range of motion testing. X-rays reveal moderate joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and mild osteophyte formation.

Which one of the following is most likely to be associated with this patient's condition? 

A. Obesity
B. Smoking history
C. Hyperthyroidism
D. Chronic kidney disease
E. Vitamin D deficiency

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Risk factors for developing osteoarthritis include obesity due to increased mechanical stress on weight-bearing joints like knees and hips; smoking has also been implicated as a potential risk factor due to its effects on cartilage metabolism. Hyperthyroidism, chronic kidney disease, and vitamin D deficiency are not typically associated with osteoarthritis development or progression.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a history of bone pain and muscle weakness for the past year. She reports difficulty in walking, climbing stairs, and getting up from a sitting position. On examination, she has tenderness over her ribs, pelvis, and proximal limb muscles.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a history of fever, chills, and severe pain in his left foot for the past week. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease. On examination, there is erythema, warmth, and tenderness over the dorsum of the left foot with no signs of ulceration or gangrene. An X-ray reveals periosteal elevation and cortical destruction suggestive of osteomyelitis.
Which one of the following is true regarding diabetic foot osteomyelitis? 

A. Gram-negative organisms are more common than gram-positive organisms
B. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus 
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not useful in diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis
D. Surgical debridement should be avoided in patients with peripheral arterial disease 
E. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has shown no benefit in treating diabetic foot osteomyelitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Diabetic foot infections are commonly associated with osteomyelitis due to impaired wound healing and decreased immune function caused by hyperglycemia. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. Gram-negative organisms are less frequently isolated from these infections.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of persistent pain in her right hip for several weeks that has been worsening despite analgesics use. She also reports having night sweats and weight loss for the past few months but denies any recent trauma or injury to her hip joint.
On examination, there is tenderness over the right hip joint with limited range of motion on internal rotation.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Septic arthritis
B. Osteoarthritis
C. Osteonecrosis
D. Rheumatoid arthritis 
E. Tuberculosis osteomyelitis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Tuberculosis (TB) osteomyelitis is a rare form of extrapulmonary TB that can affect any bone in the body, including the hip joint. It typically presents with chronic pain and stiffness that worsens over time, along with constitutional symptoms such as night sweats and weight loss. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and may involve imaging studies such as X-rays or MRI, along with culture and histopathological examination of biopsy specimens.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a history of fever, chills, and severe pain in his left arm for the past few days following an injury sustained during a football match.
On examination, there is swelling, erythema, warmth, tenderness over the left forearm with no signs of open wound or fracture.
What is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Empirical antibiotic therapy
B. Incision and drainage
C. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
E. Surgical debridement

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis usually occurs secondary to bacterial seeding from another site of infection via bloodstream; it commonly affects long bones like femur or tibia but can also occur in other bones like humerus or radius/ulna after trauma or surgery. The initial management should be empirical antibiotic therapy based on local resistance patterns while awaiting culture results to guide definitive treatment if necessary; surgical intervention may be required if there is evidence of abscess formation or failure to respond to medical therapy alone.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a history of multiple vertebral fractures over the past year. She has no significant medical history and takes no regular medication. Her physical examination is unremarkable, but her DEXA scan shows a T-score of -3.2 at the lumbar spine.

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Initiate treatment with teriparatide
B. Start first-line bone protection (i.e., ensure calcium/vitamin D replete + oral bisphosphonate)
C. Refer for vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty
D. Perform genetic testing for osteoporosis-associated genes
E. Order a CT scan of the thorax and abdomen

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Teriparatide is a recombinant human parathyroid hormone that stimulates new bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity while reducing osteoclast activity. It is indicated for patients with severe osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture, such as those with multiple vertebral fractures or low BMD despite previous treatment with other agents.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of back pain after lifting heavy boxes during a recent move to a new house. He has no significant medical history and takes no regular medication, but he smokes around 10 cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally.

On examination, there is tenderness on palpation over the lower thoracic spine, but there are no neurological deficits.

What imaging modality would be most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis? 

A. X-ray of the thoracic spine
B. MRI of the thoracic spine
C. CT scan of the thoracic spine
D. PET-CT scan 
E. Bone scintigraphy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: An MRI scan is more sensitive than an X-ray for detecting vertebral fractures, especially in the acute phase. It can also identify other causes of back pain, such as spinal cord compression or infection.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of recurrent kidney stones and abdominal pain. She has no significant medical history and takes no regular medication. Her physical examination is unremarkable, but her blood tests show hypercalcaemia (serum calcium 2.8 mmol/L) and hypophosphataemia (serum phosphate 0.5 mmol/L).

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Primary hyperparathyroidism
B. Secondary hyperparathyroidism
C. Hypoparathyroidism 
D. Vitamin D toxicity 
E. Renal osteodystrophy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common cause of hypercalcaemia and is often asymptomatic, but it can present with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, constipation, or bone pain due to osteoporosis or fractures. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a parathyroid adenoma that secretes excess PTH, leading to increased bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption while decreasing phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with a history of severe otalgia and discharge from the right ear for the past two weeks. He has been using over-the-counter ear drops but there is no improvement in his symptoms. On examination, the external auditory canal appears erythematous and swollen, with purulent discharge. The tympanic membrane cannot be visualized due to swelling.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute otitis media
B. Chronic suppurative otitis media
C. Otitis externa malignancy 
D. Necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa 
E. Cholesteatoma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa, which typically occurs in elderly diabetic patients or immunocompromised individuals who have poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or HIV infection respectively.

Question
A 40-year-old woman presents with a one-month history of persistent itching and pain in her left ear that has not responded to topical antibiotics prescribed by her GP. She also reports hearing loss on that side and occasional tinnitus. Otoscopy reveals an inflamed, edematous external auditory canal with debris and granulation tissue obscuring visualization of the tympanic membrane.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Fungal otitis externa
B. Bacterial otitis externa
C. Allergic contact dermatitis 
D. Malignant (necrotising) otitis externa 
E. Viral otitis externa 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features are suggestive of fungal otitis externa, which can present as chronic inflammation of the external auditory canal associated with pruritus, pain, otorrhea, hearing loss, and occasionally tinnitus.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with a two-week history of right-sided otalgia, otorrhea, and hearing loss. He has a history of recurrent episodes of otitis externa in the past. Otoscopy reveals an erythematous, edematous external auditory canal with purulent discharge and debris.

A. Oral antibiotics 
B. Topical steroids 
C. Systemic antifungal therapy
D. Irrigation of the ear canal
E. Culture and sensitivity testing

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The first step in managing this patient would be to obtain a culture and sensitivity test from the ear discharge to identify the causative organism(s) and guide antibiotic treatment accordingly.

Question
A 6-year-old child presents with a history of recurrent otitis media and hearing loss in the left ear for the past few months. On examination, there is no discharge from either ear, but otoscopy reveals a retracted tympanic membrane on the left side. Pure tone audiometry shows conductive hearing loss in the affected ear.
What is the most likely diagnosis? What are the possible causes? What investigations would you perform? How would you manage this patient?

A. Myringotomy
B. Tympanoplasty
C. Cochlear implantation
D. MRI scan of temporal bone
E. Observation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) with cholesteatoma formation causing conductive hearing loss due to ossicular erosion or fixation. Possible causes include previous episodes of acute otitis media, eustachian tube dysfunction, and immunodeficiency states such as HIV infection or primary ciliary dyskinesia syndrome. Investigations should include high-resolution CT scan of temporal bone and audiological evaluation including pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry. Management involves surgical intervention with myringotomy and ventilation tube insertion followed by tympanoplasty if necessary.

Question
A 2-year-old child presents with fever, irritability, vomiting, and decreased oral intake for two days along with pulling at his right ear frequently. On examination, he has a temperature of 39°C, tachycardia, erythematous pharynx with tonsillar exudates bilaterally and bulging right tympanic membrane.
What is your differential diagnosis? What investigations would you perform? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Acute mastoiditis
B. Meningitis
C. Otitis externa 
D. Peritonsillar abscess
E. Acute otitis media

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The differential diagnosis includes acute mastoiditis, meningitis, otitis externa, peritonsillar abscess and acute otitis media. Investigations should include blood cultures, complete blood count with differential and C-reactive protein levels. Imaging studies like CT scan of temporal bone or MRI may be required in cases where complications are suspected. Management involves hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics and surgical intervention if necessary.

Question
A 4-year-old child presents with a history of recurrent episodes of acute otitis media since infancy along with speech delay and behavioral problems. On examination, he has bilateral retracted tympanic membranes with decreased mobility.
What is the most likely diagnosis? What investigations would you perform? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Otitis media with effusion
B. Cholesteatoma 
C. Tympanic membrane perforation
D. Glue ear 
E. Otosclerosis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is glue ear (otitis media with effusion) due to chronic eustachian tube dysfunction leading to accumulation of fluid in the middle ear causing hearing loss, speech delay and behavioural problems in children. Investigations should include pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry to confirm the diagnosis and assess the degree of hearing loss. Management options include observation, myringotomy with ventilation tube insertion or adenoidectomy depending on the severity of symptoms and duration of disease course.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with abdominal bloating, pelvic pain, and increased urinary frequency for the past few months. She has no significant medical history but reports a family history of breast and ovarian cancer in her maternal side. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the abdomen. Imaging studies reveal a large complex cystic-solid lesion on the left ovary with ascites and peritoneal nodules suggestive of advanced-stage ovarian cancer.

Which of the following is not a recognized risk factor for developing ovarian cancer? 

A. Family history of breast or ovarian cancer
B. Nulliparity or late age at first pregnancy 
C. Use of hormonal contraceptives 
D. Endometriosis 
E. Early menopause

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The use of hormonal contraceptives has been shown to decrease the risk of developing ovarian cancer by up to 50%. Other established risk factors include genetic predisposition (BRCA1/2 mutations), nulliparity or late age at first pregnancy, endometriosis, and early menarche or late menopause.

Question
A 62-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with vague abdominal discomfort and constipation for several weeks. Physical examination reveals an enlarged uterus with palpable adnexal masses bilaterally. Pelvic ultrasound confirms multiple solid-cystic lesions involving both ovaries measuring up to 10 cm in size.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Ovarian epithelial carcinoma 
B. Borderline ovarian tumor 
C. Germ cell tumor 
D. Sex cord-stromal tumor 
E. Metastatic disease from another site

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Ovarian epithelial carcinoma is the most common type of malignant ovarian tumor accounting for approximately 90% of cases in women over 40 years old presenting with symptoms such as abdominal distension, pain, and urinary symptoms. Borderline ovarian tumors are less aggressive than epithelial carcinomas but still have the potential to recur or progress to invasive cancer. Germ cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors are rare types of ovarian neoplasms that typically affect younger women.

Question
A 50-year-old woman with a history of stage IIIc serous ovarian carcinoma presents for follow-up after completing adjuvant chemotherapy and debulking surgery. She is concerned about the risk of recurrence and asks her oncologist about additional treatment options.

Which of the following is not an appropriate maintenance therapy option? 

A. Bevacizumab 
B. Olaparib 
C. Paclitaxel 
D. Ipilimumab 
E. Niraparib

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Maintenance therapy refers to the use of systemic treatments after completion of initial therapy in order to prolong disease-free survival or overall survival in patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer who have achieved a complete or partial response to primary treatment. The most commonly used agents include bevacizumab (an anti-angiogenic agent), olaparib (a PARP inhibitor), paclitaxel (a taxane chemotherapy), and niraparib (a poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor). Ipilimumab is not approved for use in ovarian cancer as it targets immune checkpoints involved in T-cell activation rather than tumor-specific pathways.

Question

C.Sensitivity = 75%, Specificity = 95%
D.Sensitivity = 90%, Specificity = 85%
E.Sensitivity=100%, Specificity= 50%

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: CA 19-9 is not a specific marker for pancreatic cancer and can be elevated in other conditions such as cholangiocarcinoma, liver cirrhosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The sensitivity of CA 19-9 for pancreatic adenocarcinoma ranges from 50% to 80%, while the specificity ranges from 68% to 90%.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with fatigue, shortness of breath, and easy bruising for the past month. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is on methotrexate therapy. On examination, she appears pale and petechiae are noted on her arms and legs. Blood tests reveal pancytopenia with Hb 80 g/L (135-180), platelets 40 * 109/L (150 - 400), WBC 1.5 * 109/L (4.0 - 11.0). Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic normochromic red cells with occasional teardrop-shaped poikilocytes, giant platelets, and hypogranular neutrophils.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute myeloid leukemia
B. Myelodysplastic syndrome
C. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
D. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
E. Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation along with laboratory findings suggest bone marrow failure due to methotrexate-induced myelosuppression or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MDS is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to cytopenias in one or more cell lines, which can progress to acute leukemia over time.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with fatigue and generalized weakness for several weeks. He reports no significant medical history but admits to smoking heavily for the past three decades. Physical examination reveals pallor without any lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Blood tests show pancytopenia with Hb 90 g/L (135-180), platelets 30 * 109/L (150 - 400), WBC 2.0 * 109/L (4.0 - 11.0). Bone marrow biopsy reveals hypocellular marrow with reduced erythroid and myeloid precursors.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Aplastic anemia
B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
C. Myelodysplastic syndrome
D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation along with laboratory findings suggest aplastic anemia, a rare disorder characterized by bone marrow failure due to immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells or their microenvironmental support cells.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of fever, fatigue, and abdominal pain for several months. She reports no significant medical history but admits to recent travel to Southeast Asia where she had multiple mosquito bites. Physical examination reveals hepatosplenomegaly without any lymphadenopathy or rash. Blood tests show pancytopenia with Hb 95 g/L (135-180), platelets 50 * 109/L (150 - 400), WBC 1.5 * 109/L (4.0 - 11.0). Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic normochromic red cells with occasional schistocytes and fragmented neutrophils.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Hemolytic uremic syndrome
B. Malaria-induced thrombocytopenia
C. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
D. Sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation
E. Typhoid fever-induced bone marrow suppression

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation along with laboratory findings suggest malaria-induced thrombocytopenia, a common complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection characterized by sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the microvasculature leading to hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and organ dysfunction.

Question
A 72-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease presents to the clinic with worsening symptoms. He reports experiencing severe tremors, rigidity, and difficulty walking. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He has been taking levodopa-carbidopa for several years but has noticed that it no longer provides adequate relief.

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Increase the dose of levodopa-carbidopa
B. Add amantadine to his medication regimen
C. Switch to a dopamine agonist such as pramipexole or ropinirole
D. Consider deep brain stimulation surgery
E. Refer him for physical therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is an effective treatment option for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who are not responding well to medication or have intolerable side effects from medication. DBS involves implanting electrodes into specific areas of the brain that control movement and then using a small device similar to a pacemaker to deliver electrical impulses to these areas, which can help reduce tremors, stiffness, and other motor symptoms.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with complaints of fatigue, depression, and difficulty sleeping over the past few months. She also reports feeling stiff when she wakes up in the morning and having trouble performing fine motor tasks such as buttoning her shirt or writing with a pen.

On examination, she has bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, and a resting tremor in both hands that disappears during voluntary movements.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Essential tremor
B. Multiple system atrophy
C. Progressive supranuclear palsy
D. Idiopathic Parkinson's disease
E. Corticobasal degeneration

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by the presence of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. Essential tremor typically presents as a postural or kinetic tremor that worsens with movement and improves at rest. Multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration are all neurodegenerative disorders that can present with parkinsonian symptoms but have additional features such as autonomic dysfunction, oculomotor abnormalities, or cortical signs.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of difficulty walking and frequent falls over the past few months. He also reports experiencing stiffness in his arms and legs and having trouble initiating movements.

On examination, he has bradykinesia, rigidity, and a wide-based gait with reduced arm swing. His speech is slow and monotonous.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?

A. Start levodopa-carbidopa
B. Refer him for physical therapy
C. Order brain imaging studies
D. Consider deep brain stimulation surgery
E. Prescribe amantadine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: While the patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of Parkinson's disease, it is important to rule out other potential causes of parkinsonism such as structural lesions or hydrocephalus before starting treatment with dopaminergic medications like levodopa-carbidopa or considering surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation. Brain imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) can help identify any underlying pathology that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his right arm after a minor fall at home. On examination, there is significant swelling and tenderness over the mid-shaft of the humerus. An x-ray reveals a pathological fracture with extensive periosteal reaction and cortical thickening. Further investigations reveal elevated serum calcium levels and multiple lytic lesions on bone scan.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Osteosarcoma
B. Multiple myeloma
C. Metastatic breast cancer
D. Paget's disease of bone
E. Fibrous dysplasia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presentation is consistent with a pathological fracture due to underlying malignancy, with multiple lytic lesions seen on bone scan and elevated serum calcium levels suggesting hypercalcaemia of malignancy, which is commonly seen in multiple myeloma.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with persistent back pain that has been gradually worsening over several months, despite conservative management including physiotherapy and analgesia. She reports no history of trauma or significant medical problems but does describe feeling generally unwell, fatigued and having lost weight recently.

On examination, she has tenderness over the lower thoracic spine without any neurological deficits noted.

An MRI shows an osteolytic lesion involving T11 vertebrae with surrounding soft tissue mass effect.

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A) Surgical decompression and stabilisation
B) Radiotherapy
C) Chemotherapy
D) Bisphosphonate therapy
E) Observation only

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical picture suggests metastatic spinal cord compression from an unknown primary tumour; therefore chemotherapy would be indicated as first-line treatment for this patient before further work-up can be done to identify the primary source of metastasis.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with a pathological fracture of the left femur after a minor fall at home. He has a history of prostate cancer, which was treated with radical prostatectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy 5 years ago. His PSA levels have been stable since then.

An x-ray shows an osteolytic lesion involving the proximal femur with extensive periosteal reaction and cortical thickening.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A) Osteosarcoma
B) Multiple myeloma
C) Metastatic prostate cancer
D) Paget's disease of bone
E) Fibrous dysplasia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical picture suggests metastasis from previously treated prostate cancer, which commonly metastasises to bones such as the spine, pelvis and long bones. The radiological findings are consistent with an osteolytic lesion with surrounding soft tissue mass effect seen in metastatic lesions.

Question
A 65-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation and previous stroke is admitted to the hospital with a new onset pulmonary embolism. She is started on therapeutic dose enoxaparin, but her platelet count drops significantly after 3 days of treatment. The heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) assay comes back positive for HIT antibodies. What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Switch to fondaparinux
B. Discontinue all anticoagulation therapy
C. Initiate argatroban infusion 
D. Start warfarin immediately 
E. Administer low-dose aspirin

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients with confirmed or suspected HIT, immediate discontinuation of heparin products is recommended due to the high risk of thrombotic complications associated with continued use. Argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, can be used as an alternative anticoagulant in these patients.

Question
An 80-year-old man presents to his GP clinic complaining of recurrent nosebleeds over the past week despite using nasal saline spray regularly for relief from dryness caused by oxygen therapy at home for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease and takes aspirin daily for secondary prevention. On examination, there are no signs of active bleeding from the nose or any other site.
What would be your next step in managing this patient? 

A. Stop aspirin therapy immediately 
B. Order coagulation studies including PT/INR and PTT 
C. Refer him urgently to an ENT specialist 
D. Prescribe tranexamic acid tablets 
E. Increase oxygen flow rate at home

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation and can increase the risk of bleeding, especially when combined with other anticoagulant therapies. In this patient, coagulation studies should be ordered to assess for any underlying bleeding disorder or potential drug interactions.

Question
A 70-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe headache and confusion. CT scan reveals an intracranial hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and was started on apixaban 2 weeks ago for stroke prevention. Her blood pressure is elevated at 180/100 mmHg.
What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Administer vitamin K to reverse anticoagulation 
B. Initiate fresh frozen plasma transfusion 
C. Lower blood pressure immediately with IV labetalol 
D. Discontinue apixaban therapy permanently 
E. Consult neurosurgery for urgent intervention

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious complication associated with anticoagulant therapy, especially in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or renal impairment who are at higher risk of bleeding events. Urgent consultation with neurosurgery is recommended for consideration of surgical intervention if indicated based on the location and severity of the bleed.

Question
A 60-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous myocardial infarction presents to the emergency department with acute chest pain radiating to her left arm. She is haemodynamically stable with a pulse of 80 bpm and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. An electrocardiogram shows ST-segment depression in leads V1-V6. The patient has been on aspirin therapy for several years as part of her secondary prevention regimen. What would be the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Administer clopidogrel (75mg) immediately
B. Administer heparin intravenously 
C. Perform an urgent coronary angiography 
D. Start fibrinolytic therapy 
E. Continue aspirin therapy only

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). As she is already on aspirin therapy, adding another antiplatelet agent such as clopidogrel may not provide additional benefit but increase bleeding risk instead. Heparin can be considered as part of initial treatment but it does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms which is likely due to significant coronary artery disease that requires definitive intervention such as coronary angiography followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or bypass surgery if indicated.

Question
A 70-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation and previous stroke presents to his GP clinic for follow-up after being started on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin two weeks ago. He reports feeling generally unwell and experiencing mild abdominal discomfort over the past few days but denies any overt gastrointestinal bleeding or bruising at this stage.
What should be done next? 

A. Order a complete blood count and coagulation profile
B. Stop warfarin immediately and start low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
C. Order a faecal occult blood test 
D. Continue warfarin therapy but monitor closely for signs of bleeding
E. Refer the patient to gastroenterology for urgent endoscopy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are non-specific but may be suggestive of early signs of bleeding, which is a known complication of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. However, stopping or changing the medication without further investigation may increase the risk of thromboembolic events in this high-risk patient population. Therefore, ordering laboratory tests such as complete blood count and coagulation profile can help assess the extent and severity of any potential bleeding while allowing continued monitoring of anticoagulation efficacy.

Question
A 55-year-old male smoker presents to his GP clinic with exertional chest pain that has been worsening over the past few weeks despite taking aspirin daily as prescribed by his cardiologist after a previous myocardial infarction two years ago.
What would be the most appropriate next step? 

A. Increase aspirin dose to 325mg daily 
B. Add clopidogrel (75mg) to current regimen 
C. Switch from aspirin to ticagrelor (90mg) 
D. Perform an exercise stress test 
E. Refer the patient for coronary angiography 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests recurrent angina despite being on antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone, indicating possible progression or recurrence of underlying coronary artery disease that requires further evaluation and intervention beyond medical management alone. Increasing aspirin dose or adding another antiplatelet agent may not provide additional benefit but increase bleeding risk instead, especially in smokers who have higher cardiovascular risk factors than non-smokers due to accelerated atherosclerosis development. An exercise stress test may not be sensitive enough to detect significant coronary artery disease in this patient population. Therefore, referral for coronary angiography is the most appropriate next step to assess the extent and severity of any potential obstructive lesions that may require percutaneous or surgical intervention.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. She reports a history of unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners over the past few months. On examination, there is tenderness on palpation of her cervix and uterus, and she has cervical motion tenderness. Blood tests reveal an elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein level.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Appendicitis
B. Ovarian torsion
C. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
D. Pelvic inflammatory disease complicated by tubo-ovarian abscess 
E. Acute pancreatitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is often caused by sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. The presence of cervical motion tenderness suggests involvement of the fallopian tubes, which can lead to the development of a tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). This complication requires urgent treatment with antibiotics and possible drainage if necessary.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP with chronic pelvic pain that has been ongoing for several months. She reports dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and heavy menstrual bleeding. She has no significant medical history but has had multiple sexual partners in the past year without using contraception consistently.
Which one of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Transvaginal ultrasound scan
B. Hysteroscopy
C. Endometrial biopsy
D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pelvis
E. Laparoscopy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). While transvaginal ultrasound may show evidence of endometriotic cysts or adhesions, it is not a definitive diagnostic test. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy are unlikely to provide useful information in this case. MRI pelvis may be helpful in ruling out other causes of pelvic pain but is not specific for PID or endometriosis. Laparoscopy is the gold standard investigation for both conditions, allowing direct visualization of the pelvic organs and tissue sampling if necessary.

Question
A 24-year-old woman presents to her GP with lower abdominal pain and vaginal discharge. She reports recent unprotected sexual intercourse with a new partner. On examination, there is cervical motion tenderness and purulent discharge from the cervix.
Which one of the following antibiotics would be most appropriate as first-line treatment? 

A. Amoxicillin
B. Doxycycline
C. Metronidazole
D. Ceftriaxone
E. Azithromycin

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest acute bacterial infection, most likely due to chlamydia or gonorrhea, which are common causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Ceftriaxone is recommended as first-line treatment for uncomplicated gonococcal infections, while doxycycline or azithromycin should also be given to cover possible chlamydial co-infection. Metronidazole may be added if anaerobic bacteria are suspected or if there is evidence of bacterial vaginosis on microscopy. Amoxicillin has no role in the treatment of PID caused by sexually transmitted infections.

Question
A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain that radiates to his back and is associated with nausea and vomiting. He has a history of heavy alcohol consumption and smoking. On examination, he is tachycardic and hypotensive. Blood tests reveal elevated pancreatic enzymes, as well as anemia and leukocytosis. An abdominal CT scan shows evidence of acute pancreatitis with fluid collections.

What is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis in this patient? 

A. Biliary tract disease
B. Hypertriglyceridemia
C. Trauma
D. Viral infection
E. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Heavy alcohol consumption and smoking are risk factors for chronic pancreatitis but not necessarily for acute pancreatitis. The combination of hypertriglyceridemia, heavy alcohol use, and smoking increases the risk of developing acute pancreatitis.

Question
A 27-year-old female presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of epigastric pain that worsen after eating spicy or fatty foods. She also reports feeling bloated after meals and occasional nausea without vomiting or weight loss. Her medical history is unremarkable except for a family history of peptic ulcer disease.

Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be most appropriate? 

A. Fecal occult blood test
B. H.pylori stool antigen test
C. Serum gastrin level measurement 
D. Upper GI endoscopy 
E. Abdominal ultrasound 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The symptoms described suggest peptic ulcer disease, which can be diagnosed definitively by upper GI endoscopy with biopsy if necessary.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of dyspepsia, early satiety, unintentional weight loss over several months, and occasional vomiting. He has a history of smoking and alcohol use disorder. On examination, there is mild epigastric tenderness but no palpable masses or lymphadenopathy.

Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be most appropriate? 

A. Abdominal CT scan 
B. Fecal occult blood test
C. Serum gastrin level measurement 
D. Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy
E. H.pylori stool antigen test

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The symptoms described suggest gastric cancer, which can be diagnosed definitively by abdominal CT scan with contrast to assess for tumor size, location, and metastasis. Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy may also be necessary for definitive diagnosis and staging.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe pain and swelling around his anus. He reports that he had a perianal abscess drained a few months ago, but now the symptoms have returned and are more severe. On examination, there is an area of erythema and induration surrounding the anus, and pus can be expressed from a small opening in the skin.

What is the most likely diagnosis? Which imaging modality would be best for further evaluation? What is the recommended management?

A. Diagnosis: Perianal fistula; Imaging: Abdominal X-ray; Management: Antibiotics
B. Diagnosis: Perianal abscess; Imaging: Pelvic CT scan; Management: Incision & drainage
C. Diagnosis: Anal fissure; Imaging: MRI pelvis; Management: Topical steroids
D. Diagnosis: Pilonidal cyst; Imaging: Ultrasound abdomen; Management: Excision
E. Diagnosis: Hidradenitis suppurativa; Imaging: PET-CT scan; Management: Oral antibiotics

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with recurrent perianal abscesses, which may progress to form a fistula-in-ano if not treated promptly. The best imaging modality for evaluating suspected anal fistulas is an MRI pelvis, as it provides excellent soft tissue contrast resolution and allows visualization of any associated tracts or extensions.

Management of acute perianal abscesses involves incision and drainage under local anaesthesia or sedation, followed by packing of the wound cavity with gauze to prevent premature closure and promote healing from inside out.

Question
An otherwise healthy 28-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of persistent discharge from her anus for several weeks. She denies any history of trauma or surgery in the perineal region but reports occasional mild rectal bleeding. On examination, there is a small opening in the skin surrounding her anus from which purulent discharge can be expressed.

What is the most likely diagnosis? Which investigations would you order? What is the recommended management?

A. Diagnosis: Anal fissure; Investigations: FBC and CRP; Management: Topical nitrates
B. Diagnosis: Perianal abscess; Investigations: Colonoscopy; Management: Antibiotics
C. Diagnosis: Pilonidal cyst; Investigations: Pelvic CT scan; Management: Excision
D. Diagnosis: Hidradenitis suppurativa; Investigations: Skin biopsy; Management: Oral antibiotics
E. Diagnosis: Anal fistula; Investigations: MRI pelvis; Management: Seton placement

Correct Answer: E

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with an anal fistula, which may develop as a complication of perianal abscesses or inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease. The best investigation for evaluating suspected anal fistulas is an MRI pelvis, as it allows visualization of any associated tracts or extensions and helps to determine the optimal surgical approach.

Management of anal fistulas depends on their location, complexity, and underlying cause but typically involves surgical intervention such as seton placement or fistulotomy.

Question
A 42-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of recurrent pain and swelling around his anus for several months. He reports that he had a perianal abscess drained surgically last year but now has developed another one in the same area. On examination, there is an area of erythema and induration surrounding the anus, and pus can be expressed from a small opening in the skin.

What are the risk factors for developing perianal abscesses? What imaging modality would be best for further evaluation? What is the recommended management?

A. Risk factors: Smoking and alcohol use; Imaging: Abdominal X-ray; Management: Oral antibiotics
B. Risk factors: Obesity and sedentary lifestyle; Imaging: Pelvic CT scan; Management: Incision & drainage
C. Risk factors: Diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression; Imaging: MRI pelvis; Management: Topical steroids
D. Risk factors: Crohn's disease and anal intercourse; Imaging: Ultrasound abdomen; Management: Excision
E. Risk factors: Hidradenitis suppurativa and poor hygiene; Imaging: PET-CT scan; Management: Antibiotics

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:

The risk factors for developing perianal abscesses include underlying inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and anal intercourse.

The best imaging modality for evaluating suspected perianal abscesses is a pelvic CT scan with contrast, which can help to determine the extent of the infection and any associated complications such as fistula formation or abscess extension.

Management of acute perianal abscesses involves incision and drainage under local anaesthesia or sedation, followed by packing of the wound cavity with gauze to prevent premature closure and promote healing from inside out. In patients with recurrent or complex abscesses, further surgical intervention such as fistulotomy or seton placement may be necessary.

She reports difficulty extending her wrist and fingers, as well as numbness over the back of her hand and forearm. On examination, there is wasting of extensor carpi radialis longus muscle with decreased grip strength noted on the right side. Sensory examination reveals decreased sensation over the dorsal aspect of her thumb and index finger.
Which peripheral nerve is most likely affected? 

A. Radial nerve
B. Ulnar nerve
C. Median nerve
D. Axillary nerve
E. Musculocutaneous nerve

Correct Answer: A (The patient’s symptoms are consistent with radial neuropathy which can be caused by compression or injury to the radial nerve anywhere along its course from the brachial plexus down to the wrist.)

Explanation: The radial nerve innervates several muscles in the posterior compartment of the arm including triceps brachii, anconeus, and supinator; it also supplies sensation to parts of skin on dorsal aspect of hand and forearm.

Question
A 62-year-old male presents with a history of intermittent claudication in his left leg for the past six months. He has noticed that he can only walk about 50 meters before experiencing pain and discomfort in his leg, which is relieved on rest. The patient also reports numbness and tingling sensation in his toes. On examination, there are no palpable pulses below the inguinal ligament on the left side. An ABPI test was performed, which showed an ABPI value of 0.4.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome
B. Buerger's disease
C. Acute arterial occlusion
D. Arterial embolism
E. Peripheral arterial disease

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests peripheral vascular disease affecting the left lower limb, with symptoms consistent with intermittent claudication and reduced blood flow to the affected area causing numbness and tingling sensations in the toes. The absence of palpable pulses below the inguinal ligament indicates significant stenosis or occlusion of one or more arteries supplying blood to the lower limb, making popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) a likely diagnosis. PAES is a rare condition where compression occurs between muscles and bones around the popliteal artery leading to ischemia distally.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents with bilateral foot pain associated with redness and swelling for two days after returning from a long-haul flight from Australia to London via Singapore without any stopovers en route due to work commitments as an air hostess.

Which of the following conditions may be responsible for her symptoms? 

A. Deep vein thrombosis 
B. Pulmonary embolism 
C. Raynaud's phenomenon 
D. Venous insufficiency 
E. Peripheral arterial disease

Correct Answer: A 

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a common complication associated with long-haul flights. DVT occurs when blood clots form in the deep veins of the legs, leading to pain, swelling, and redness. Pulmonary embolism may occur if these clots dislodge and travel to the lungs. Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by vasospasm of small arteries in response to cold or stress, causing numbness and tingling sensations in fingers and toes. Venous insufficiency refers to impaired venous return from the lower limbs due to valve dysfunction or obstruction, leading to edema and skin changes. Peripheral arterial disease results from atherosclerosis affecting the arteries supplying blood to the lower limbs.

Question
A 58-year-old male presents with sudden onset severe pain in his right leg that started two hours ago while he was watching TV at home. He describes it as a cramp-like sensation that has not improved despite rest and elevation of the affected limb. On examination, there is pallor, coolness, and absence of pulses below the popliteal fossa on the right side.

Which of the following conditions should be suspected? 

A. Acute arterial occlusion 
B. Arterial embolism 
C. Buerger's disease 
D. Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome 
E. Thromboangiitis obliterans

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests acute arterial occlusion involving one or more arteries supplying blood to the right lower limb resulting in ischemia distally beyond where there are no palpable pulses below popliteal fossa on examination indicating an abrupt cessation of flow through this vessel(s). This can lead to sudden onset severe pain that does not improve with rest or elevation of affected limb along with pallor and coolness. Arterial embolism is another possible cause of acute arterial occlusion, but the absence of a history of cardiac disease or recent surgery makes it less likely. Buerger's disease, popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, and thromboangiitis obliterans are chronic conditions that present with intermittent claudication rather than sudden onset severe pain.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and distension. She has a history of endometriosis and had undergone laparoscopic surgery for it six months ago.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as he has leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia along with splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy which are common features of this condition.

Management includes tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib or dasatinib which target BCR-ABL fusion protein that drives CML proliferation.

Diagnostic criteria include presence of Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL1 fusion gene on cytogenetic or molecular testing along with clinical features suggestive of CML such as leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly etc.

Question
A 70-year-old male presents to the GP with a history of severe pain and stiffness in his shoulders, hips, and neck for the past 3 months. He also complains of fatigue and loss of appetite. His symptoms have been progressively worsening, making it difficult for him to perform daily activities such as dressing himself or combing his hair. On examination, there is tenderness over both shoulders and hips, but no swelling or redness is noted. The patient's ESR is elevated at 60mm/hour.

Which of the following investigations would be most helpful in confirming the diagnosis? 

A. MRI scan of the affected joints
B. Ultrasound scan of the affected joints
C. Rheumatoid factor test
D. HLA-B27 gene testing
E. Temporal artery biopsy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a clinical diagnosis that can be supported by laboratory tests such as an elevated ESR or CRP level; however, these tests are not specific for PMR and can be elevated in other inflammatory conditions as well. In patients suspected of having PMR, temporal artery biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out giant cell arteritis (GCA), which has similar clinical features but requires urgent treatment to prevent complications such as blindness.

Question
A 65-year-old female presents with a one-month history of bilateral shoulder pain and stiffness that worsens in the morning and improves throughout the day. She also reports feeling fatigued and weak, especially in her upper arms when lifting objects above her head or reaching behind her back. Her medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoporosis treated with bisphosphonates.
On examination, there is limited range of motion in both shoulders without any signs of joint inflammation or muscle wasting.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. Start high-dose prednisolone therapy
B. Refer to a rheumatologist for further evaluation
C. Prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
D. Order an MRI scan of the shoulders and cervical spine
E. Perform electromyography (EMG) to assess muscle function

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The diagnosis of PMR is based on clinical features, and treatment should be initiated promptly to relieve symptoms and prevent complications such as fractures or depression due to chronic pain and disability. However, before starting treatment with glucocorticoids, other causes of musculoskeletal pain should be ruled out, especially in patients with comorbidities or atypical presentations. Therefore, referral to a rheumatologist for further evaluation is recommended.

Question
A 75-year-old male presents with a one-week history of sudden onset severe headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, fever, fatigue, and weight loss. He also reports bilateral shoulder pain and stiffness that worsens in the morning but improves during the day.
On examination, there is no evidence of joint inflammation or muscle weakness; however, temporal artery tenderness is noted.
Laboratory tests reveal an elevated ESR and CRP level.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Start high-dose prednisolone therapy immediately
B. Order a temporal artery biopsy urgently
C. Perform magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck
D. Prescribe antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection
E. Refer to neurology for further evaluation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), which is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids to prevent irreversible complications such as blindness or stroke. Temporal artery biopsy should be performed urgently to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Glucocorticoid therapy should not be delayed until biopsy results are available, as this can lead to irreversible damage.

Question
A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with heavy vaginal bleeding following a complicated delivery of twins. She had an episiotomy and forceps were used during the delivery. Her vital signs are stable, but her haemoglobin level is low at 7 g/dL. On examination, there is no evidence of retained products of conception or uterine atony.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's postpartum haemorrhage? What investigations should be performed? What is the management plan?

A. Perform pelvic ultrasound
B. Perform CT scan
C. Perform MRI scan
D. Perform hysteroscopy
E. Perform laparotomy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The most likely cause of this patient's postpartum haemorrhage is cervical laceration due to the use of forceps during delivery. Investigations such as pelvic ultrasound, CT scan and MRI scan may not be helpful in identifying cervical lacerations, therefore hysteroscopy should be performed to identify any cervical tears that may require suturing.

Management involves resuscitation with intravenous fluids and blood transfusion if necessary, followed by repair of any identified cervical tears under general anaesthesia.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents with excessive vaginal bleeding after giving birth via caesarean section for placenta previa at 36 weeks gestation. She has received multiple units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma without significant improvement in her condition.

A. Methotrexate 
B. Adalimumab 
C. Prednisolone
D. Sulfasalazine
E. Hydroxychloroquine

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that can be used in psoriatic arthritis to reduce inflammation and improve joint symptoms along with skin lesions. It is contraindicated in patients with active infections or tuberculosis and should be used with caution in patients with heart failure as it may worsen the condition.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain. He is hypoxic on arrival, requiring high flow oxygen therapy. CT pulmonary angiogram confirms the diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolism involving both main pulmonary arteries and multiple segmental branches. The patient's blood pressure drops precipitously despite fluid resuscitation.

Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Initiate thrombolysis
B. Perform surgical embolectomy
C. Insert an inferior vena cava filter
D. Administer heparin infusion only
E. Start extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients who are hemodynamically unstable due to massive PE, surgical embolectomy should be considered as it provides rapid removal of clot burden from the central circulation.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with acute onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and coughing up blood-stained sputum for two days duration. She has no significant past medical history or family history of thrombosis but she uses oral contraceptives regularly for contraception purposes.

What would be the most likely finding on echocardiography? 

A. Right ventricular hypertrophy 
B. Left ventricular dysfunction 
C. Mitral valve prolapse 
D. Tricuspid regurgitation 
E. Pulmonary hypertension

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Acute pulmonary embolism can lead to increased right heart afterload causing acute cor pulmonale which manifests as dilatation and dysfunction of right ventricle leading to elevated pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiography is useful in assessing the severity of right ventricular dysfunction.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) presents to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and coughing up blood-stained sputum for one day duration. CT pulmonary angiogram confirms the diagnosis of sub-massive pulmonary embolism involving both main pulmonary arteries and multiple segmental branches. The patient's vital signs are stable but he has mild hypoxemia on room air.

Which one of the following would be most appropriate initial management? 

A. Initiate systemic thrombolysis 
B. Administer low molecular weight heparin 
C. Insert an inferior vena cava filter 
D. Start rivaroxaban therapy 
E. Observe without anticoagulation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with sub-massive PE who are hemodynamically stable, anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin should be initiated as soon as possible to prevent further clot propagation while considering other treatment options such as catheter-directed thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy if necessary.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain on exertion for the past few months. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is currently taking hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil. On examination, her heart rate is regular at 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, and SpO2 92% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals a loud P2 sound and a harsh systolic murmur heard best over the left sternal border. An echocardiogram shows severe pulmonary hypertension with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 90mmHg.

Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's pulmonary hypertension? 

A. Pulmonary embolism
B. Scleroderma
C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
D. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH)
E. Congestive heart failure

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's history of SLE suggests that she may have scleroderma-associated pulmonary hypertension (SSc-PAH), which can occur in up to 15% of patients with SSc. Hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil are commonly used treatments for SLE but do not directly cause or exacerbate PAH. Pulmonary embolism can cause acute onset of symptoms but would not explain chronic symptoms over several months nor the presence of a systolic murmur on examination. COPD typically causes hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction leading to mild-to-moderate PH, whereas IPAH is characterized by idiopathic elevation in pulmonary artery pressures without any identifiable underlying cause other than genetic predisposition or environmental factors such as drugs or toxins; however, in this case, the patient's history of SLE suggests a connective tissue disease-related PAH. Congestive heart failure can cause pulmonary hypertension as a result of left-sided heart disease but would not explain the presence of a systolic murmur or the severe degree of PH seen on echocardiogram.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with progressive dyspnea and fatigue over several months. He has a history of chronic hepatitis C infection and intravenous drug use. On examination, his heart rate is regular at 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, and SpO2 92% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals normal breath sounds without any added sounds. An echocardiogram shows moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 60mmHg.

Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's pulmonary hypertension? 

A. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
B. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH)
C. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
D. Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS)
E. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history of chronic hepatitis C infection and intravenous drug use suggest that he may have hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), which occurs in up to 20% of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension due to shunting of blood from the liver to lungs resulting in hypoxemia and vasodilation leading to PH; HPS can also occur in non-cirrhotic portal hypertension such as in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection who have no evidence of cirrhosis but still develop portal hypertension due to fibrosis or inflammation within the liver parenchyma causing vascular remodeling leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. COPD can cause hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction leading to mild-to-moderate PH, whereas IPAH is characterized by idiopathic elevation in pulmonary artery pressures without any identifiable underlying cause other than genetic predisposition or environmental factors such as drugs or toxins; however, in this case, the patient's history of chronic hepatitis C infection suggests a secondary cause of PH rather than IPAH. HIV infection can also lead to PH due to opportunistic infections, vasculitis or drug toxicity but would not explain the absence of respiratory symptoms on examination nor the moderate degree of PH seen on echocardiogram. PVOD is a rare form of PAH caused by obstruction of small veins within the lungs resulting in severe PH and right heart failure; it typically presents with dyspnea, cough and hemoptysis along with diffuse interstitial lung disease on imaging studies which are absent in this patient.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with progressive shortness of breath and chest pain over several months. She has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. On examination, her heart rate is regular at 100 beats per minute, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, and SpO2 92% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals loud P2 sound and a harsh systolic murmur heard best over the left sternal border. An echocardiogram shows severe pulmonary hypertension with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 90mmHg.

Which of the following diagnostic tests should be performed next? 

A. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)
B. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan
C. Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan
D. Right heart catheterization (RHC)
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of severe pulmonary hypertension requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause and severity of disease. RHC is considered the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of PH, as it provides accurate measurements of pulmonary artery pressures, cardiac output, and pulmonary vascular resistance; it can also help differentiate between pre-capillary (PAH) and post-capillary (pulmonary venous hypertension) causes of PH by measuring pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). PFTs are useful in evaluating lung function but would not provide information on the degree or cause of PH. HRCT scan is helpful in detecting parenchymal lung diseases that may be associated with PH such as interstitial lung disease or emphysema but would not provide direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures. V/Q scan is used to diagnose acute pulmonary embolism but would not be helpful in this case since there is no suspicion for acute thromboembolic event based on clinical presentation. MRI can provide detailed images of cardiovascular structures including right ventricle size and function but has limited utility in assessing hemodynamic parameters such as pulmonary artery pressures which are better evaluated by RHC.

Question
A 2-week-old baby presents to the emergency department with projectile vomiting, dehydration and weight loss. The parents report that the baby has been feeding well but has recently started vomiting after feeds. On examination, there is visible peristalsis in the epigastric region and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant. An ultrasound confirms the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis. What are the potential complications of untreated pyloric stenosis? 

A. Dehydration

On examination, there is visible peristalsis in the left upper quadrant and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant.
An abdominal X-ray shows evidence of gastric outlet obstruction.
Which diagnostic test would be most useful in confirming this patient’s diagnosis? 

A. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 
B. Abdominal ultrasound 
C. Barium swallow 
D. CT scan of the abdomen 
E. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: An abdominal ultrasound is the most useful diagnostic test for confirming pyloric stenosis, as it can show hypertrophy of the pylorus and a thickened muscle wall in the gastric antrum.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a history of progressive weakness in his left arm and hand over the past six months. He also reports numbness and tingling in the same distribution. On examination, he has decreased strength in the biceps, triceps, and wrist extensors on the left side. There is also decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of the forearm and thumb.

A. Conservative treatment with physiotherapy 
B. Surgical decompression via an anterior approach 
C. Surgical decompression via a posterior approach 
D. Nerve root injection with steroids 
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In cases where there is significant compression of a nerve root causing neurological deficits, surgical intervention may be necessary to prevent permanent damage or worsening symptoms.

Question
A 62-year-old woman presents with neck pain radiating down her right arm for three weeks following a motor vehicle accident where she was rear-ended by another car while stationary at traffic lights. She complains of numbness and tingling in her right hand as well as difficulty gripping objects due to weakness in her fingers on that side. Examination reveals reduced grip strength on the right side along with diminished reflexes at C5-C6 levels bilaterally compared to normal reflexes elsewhere.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Brachial plexus injury
B. Thoracic outlet syndrome
C. Carpal tunnel syndrome
D. Radiculopathy at C5-C6 level
E. Ulnar neuropathy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The mechanism of injury suggests acceleration-deceleration forces leading to cervical spine hyperextension followed by flexion which can cause cervical radiculopathy.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents with a history of neck pain radiating to his left arm for the past six months. He reports numbness and tingling in his fingers on that side as well as weakness in grip strength. Examination reveals decreased sensation over the lateral aspect of the forearm, thumb, and index finger along with reduced biceps reflex on the left side.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. C5 radiculopathy
B. C6 radiculopathy
C. C7 radiculopathy
D. C8 radiculopathy
E. T1 radiculopathy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The distribution of symptoms suggests involvement of the C6 nerve root which innervates muscles responsible for wrist extension and flexion, as well as sensory supply to parts of the hand including thumb, index finger, and middle finger.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe headache associated with vomiting and confusion. On examination, he is found to have bilateral papilloedema and an elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture. CT scan reveals no evidence of intracranial haemorrhage or mass lesion.

Further investigations reveal that this patient has obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and hypertension. He is started on treatment for both conditions but continues to experience symptoms despite optimal medical management.

Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate in managing this patient's raised intracranial pressure? 

A. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
B. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy
C. Lumbar drain insertion
D. Optic nerve sheath fenestration
E. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient has multiple risk factors for raised intracranial pressure including OSA, hypertension, and papilloedema. While CPAP may improve his OSA symptoms, it is unlikely to significantly reduce his ICP. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy and ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion are invasive procedures that carry significant risks and should only be considered if other measures fail to control the ICP. Lumbar drain insertion may provide temporary relief but carries a risk of infection and can lead to spinal cord herniation in patients with high-pressure gradients between the cranium and spine. Optic nerve sheath fenestration involves creating a small hole in the optic nerve sheath to relieve pressure around the optic nerve head, which can help preserve vision in patients with papilloedema due to raised ICP.

Question
A 42-year-old woman presents with a history of chronic headaches associated with nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and tinnitus over the past 6 months. She has a BMI of 29 kg/m² and is found to have bilateral papilloedema on fundoscopy. MRI scan reveals no evidence of intracranial mass or hydrocephalus.

Lumbar puncture shows an elevated opening pressure with normal CSF composition. She is started on acetazolamide but continues to experience symptoms despite maximal medical therapy.

Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate in managing this patient's raised ICP? 

A. Craniotomy
B. Decompressive hemicraniectomy
C. Endovascular coiling
D. Optic nerve sheath fenestration
E. Stereotactic radiosurgery

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient has idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), which is characterized by increased ICP without any identifiable cause on imaging or CSF analysis. Acetazolamide is the first-line treatment for IIH, but some patients may require additional interventions if their symptoms persist despite optimal medical management. Craniotomy and decompressive hemicraniectomy are invasive procedures that carry significant risks and should only be considered in cases of refractory intracranial hypertension due to mass lesions or haemorrhage. Endovascular coiling and stereotactic radiosurgery are used primarily for treating vascular malformations and tumours, respectively, and are not indicated in IIH. Optic nerve sheath fenestration involves creating a small hole in the optic nerve sheath to relieve pressure around the optic nerve head, which can help preserve vision in patients with papilloedema due to raised ICP.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with a history of progressive memory loss, confusion, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence over the past year. On examination, he is found to have bilateral papilloedema and an elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture. MRI scan reveals diffuse white matter changes and ventricular enlargement consistent with hydrocephalus.

Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate in managing this patient's raised ICP? 

A. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy
B. Lumbar drain insertion
C. Optic nerve sheath fenestration
D. Shunt surgery
E. Stereotactic radiosurgery

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient has chronic hydrocephalus, which is characterized by progressive ventricular enlargement due to impaired CSF absorption or circulation. Chronic hydrocephalus can lead to increased ICP and neurological symptoms such as memory loss, confusion, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. The mainstay of treatment for chronic hydrocephalus is shunt surgery, which involves inserting a catheter into the ventricles to divert excess CSF to another part of the body (usually the peritoneal cavity). Endoscopic third ventriculostomy may be considered in select cases where there is obstruction at the level of the aqueduct or fourth ventricle but carries a higher risk of failure compared to shunt surgery. Lumbar drain insertion may provide temporary relief but carries a risk of infection and can lead to spinal cord herniation in patients with high-pressure gradients between the cranium and spine. Optic nerve sheath fenestration is not indicated in hydrocephalus as it does not address the underlying cause of raised ICP. Stereotactic radiosurgery is used primarily for treating tumours and vascular malformations and is not indicated in hydrocephalus.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents with acute onset of joint pain, swelling and stiffness in her knees, ankles and wrists. She reports a recent history of diarrhoea and urethritis. On examination, there is tenderness and swelling in the affected joints but no evidence of synovitis or tenosynovitis. Blood tests reveal an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Reactive arthritis
B. Rheumatoid arthritis
C. Systemic lupus erythematosus 
D. Psoriatic arthritis 
E. Ankylosing spondylitis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with reactive arthritis, which can occur following an infection such as gastroenteritis or genitourinary tract infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or other organisms. Joint involvement typically affects lower extremities asymmetrically, although it may also involve upper extremities, spine or sacroiliac joints. There may be associated extra-articular features such as conjunctivitis, uveitis, oral ulcers or skin rash.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents with recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling over several months affecting his knees, ankles and feet bilaterally without any obvious precipitating factors. He has a past medical history significant for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that was diagnosed two years ago and is currently being treated with mesalazine therapy.
On examination, there is tenderness to palpation over the affected joints without any signs of warmth or redness on inspection.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Reactive arthritis
B. Gout
C. Osteoarthritis 
D. Psoriatic arthritis 
E. Rheumatoid arthritis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with psoriatic arthritis, which is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy that can occur in patients with psoriasis or IBD. It typically affects the distal interphalangeal joints of the hands and feet, as well as larger peripheral joints such as knees and ankles. There may also be associated enthesitis (inflammation at sites where tendons or ligaments attach to bone) and dactylitis (swelling of an entire digit). 

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with chronic pain and stiffness in his lower back for several months, which has been worsening over time. He reports no history of recent infections or gastrointestinal symptoms but does have a family history of ankylosing spondylitis.
On examination, there is limited lumbar spine mobility on forward flexion and extension without any significant joint swelling or tenderness.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Reactive arthritis
B. Gout
C. Osteoarthritis 
D. Psoriatic arthritis 
E. Ankylosing spondylitis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy that primarily affects the axial skeleton including the sacroiliac joints and spine causing inflammation leading to fusion of vertebrae resulting in reduced spinal mobility. Other features include enthesitis, uveitis, fatigue and constitutional symptoms like fever and weight loss. Family history increases the likelihood of developing this condition due to genetic predisposition involving HLA-B27 gene association

Question
A 60-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the emergency department with severe shortness of breath and cyanosis. He is tachypneic, using accessory muscles to breathe, and has decreased breath sounds on auscultation. His oxygen saturation is 85% on room air.

Question
A 72-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia. He had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for over 10 years, which he managed with inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. On examination, he was tachypneic, using accessory muscles of respiration, and had bilateral wheezing on auscultation. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.28, PaCO2 75 mmHg, PaO2 55 mmHg, and HCO3- 32 mEq/L. Chest X-ray revealed hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms and bullae formation. Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Non-invasive ventilation
B. Invasive mechanical ventilation
C. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy
D. Nebulized bronchodilator therapy
E. Intravenous corticosteroids

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient has acute exacerbation of COPD leading to type II respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia requiring immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration or death. The most appropriate initial management is invasive mechanical ventilation as non-invasive ventilation may not be sufficient in this case due to severe hypoxemia and high risk of treatment failure.

Question
A 56-year-old female patient presented to the clinic with worsening shortness of breath over the past month associated with cough productive of yellow sputum and fever up to 38°C at night time only for two weeks duration that resolved spontaneously without any medication use. She had a history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate for five years but stopped it six months ago due to side effects including nausea and hair loss; she also smoked half pack per day for thirty years but quit smoking two years ago. On examination, she had bilateral crackles on auscultation and no cyanosis or clubbing. Chest X-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates in the lower lobes. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
B. Bacterial pneumonia
C. Pulmonary embolism
D. Rheumatoid lung disease
E. Viral pneumonia

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate which can cause interstitial lung disease as a side effect leading to respiratory failure; this is supported by chest X-ray findings of bilateral patchy infiltrates in the lower lobes.

Question
A 45-year-old male patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis from urinary tract infection complicated by multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He received broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy for three weeks before showing signs of clinical improvement with weaning off mechanical ventilation support over five days duration; he was then transferred to the general ward for further management and rehabilitation. Which one of the following interventions should be implemented during his recovery? 

A. Early tracheostomy placement 
B. High-dose corticosteroids 
C. Inhaled nitric oxide therapy 
D. Prone positioning 
E. Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Patients with ARDS are at high risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to immobility, inflammation, and hypercoagulable state; prophylactic anticoagulation therapy reduces this risk without increasing bleeding complications and should be implemented during recovery. Early tracheostomy placement, high-dose corticosteroids, inhaled nitric oxide therapy, and prone positioning are not indicated or may even be harmful in this case.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with sudden onset of floaters and flashes in his right eye. On examination, you note a retinal tear with subretinal fluid accumulation. The patient is scheduled for laser photocoagulation to prevent progression to retinal detachment.

A. CRS is most commonly seen in infants born to mothers infected with rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy.
B. The risk of CRS decreases as gestational age increases.
C. Infants with CRS typically have normal hearing and vision at birth but develop complications later in life.
D. Treatment of maternal rubella infection during pregnancy can prevent the development of CRS in the fetus.
E. All of the above statements are true.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The highest risk for congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) occurs when a woman contracts rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy, particularly within the first 11 weeks. The risk decreases significantly after 16 weeks gestation. Infants with CRS may be deaf, blind, or both at birth, and they often have other serious abnormalities such as heart defects, intellectual disability, and growth retardation. There is no cure for CRS; treatment is supportive and aimed at managing symptoms and complications that arise over time. Prevention through vaccination remains key to reducing the incidence of this condition.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Tuberculosis 
B. Sarcoidosis 
C. Hodgkin's lymphoma 
D. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
E. Chronic myelogenous leukemia 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation is highly suggestive of sarcoidosis due to the presence of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and an elevated serum ACE level. While tuberculosis can also present with similar symptoms, it is less likely given the absence of risk factors such as recent travel or exposure to infected individuals. Lymphomas can also cause similar symptoms but are less likely in this case given the presence of splenomegaly which is not typically seen in lymphomas.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with a severe itch and rash on her hands, feet, and genital area. She reports that the symptoms have been present for several weeks and are progressively worsening. On examination, there are erythematous papules in the web spaces between the fingers, on the wrist, ankles, and in the pubic area. There are also visible burrows. The general practitioner suspects scabies infestation and prescribes topical permethrin.

The patient is concerned about transmission of scabies to her family members who live with her in a small apartment. She has two daughters aged 30 and 35 years old who visit frequently along with their children aged 5-10 years old.

What advice should be given to this patient? 

A. Everyone in the household should receive a single application of permethrin
B. Only those individuals who have symptoms or signs of scabies should receive treatment
C. All close contacts including family members should receive prophylactic treatment
D. Treatment should only be offered if an individual has had prolonged skin-to-skin contact with the patient 
E. The patient's grandchildren do not require treatment as they are too young

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of recurrent episodes of severe headaches associated with nausea and vomiting over the past few months. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in her mother at age 50.
On examination, she appears well and there are no focal neurological deficits or signs of meningeal irritation.
What is the most appropriate initial investigation? 

A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain
B. Computed tomography (CT) scan head without contrast
C. Cerebral angiogram
D. Lumbar puncture
E. Electroencephalogram (EEG)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's clinical features suggest possible subarachnoid haemorrhage due to ruptured aneurysm given her family history; therefore, a non-contrast CT scan should be performed initially as it has high sensitivity for detecting acute SAH within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms. MRI may be considered if CT is negative but suspicion remains high, while cerebral angiogram is reserved for cases where there is high clinical suspicion despite negative imaging results.

Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. CT scan
B. MRI
C. X-ray
D. Ultrasound
E. PET scan

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing testicular torsion as it can accurately identify decreased or absent blood flow to the affected testicle. CT scan and MRI are not routinely used in the diagnosis of acute scrotal pain, while X-ray and PET scans are not indicated.

Question
A 16-year-old boy presents with sudden onset left-sided scrotal pain that started while he was sleeping. He reports associated nausea and vomiting but no fever or dysuria. On examination, there is swelling and tenderness of the left scrotum with a high-riding testis and absence of cremasteric reflex on the affected side. Ultrasound confirms decreased blood flow to the affected testicle.

Which one of the following statements regarding management of this patient is true? 

A. Immediate surgical exploration should be performed without delay.
B. Antibiotics should be initiated before surgical intervention.
C. Conservative management with analgesia alone may be considered if symptoms improve within 6 hours.
D. Manual detorsion should be attempted before surgery.
E. The unaffected testicle should also be surgically explored to prevent future torsion.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Immediate surgical exploration is required for suspected cases of testicular torsion as it is a urological emergency that requires prompt intervention to prevent loss of the affected testicle. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of infection, which would present with fever and leukocytosis in addition to scrotal pain. Conservative management with analgesia alone is not appropriate for suspected cases of testicular torsion, as time is critical in preventing irreversible damage to the affected testicle. Manual detorsion should only be attempted if immediate surgery is not possible, but it carries a risk of further injury to the already compromised tissue. The unaffected testicle does not require surgical exploration unless there are signs or symptoms suggestive of concurrent pathology such as a tumour or hydrocele.

A 50-year-old male presents with recurrent urinary tract infections despite multiple courses of antibiotics over the past year. He has no significant medical history except for mild hypertension controlled with lisinopril.
Urinalysis shows pyuria and positive leukocyte esterase but negative nitrites.
A urine culture grows Enterococcus faecalis resistant to ampicillin and ceftriaxone but sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid.
What would be the most appropriate management? 
A. Empiric treatment with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 14 days
B. Repeat urine culture after stopping current antibiotics for at least 48 hours
C. Switch to intravenous vancomycin or linezolid based on susceptibility results
D. Obtain imaging studies to evaluate for structural abnormalities of the urinary tract
E. Refer patient to urology for possible surgical intervention

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of pyuria without nitrites suggests a lower likelihood of bacterial infection, although it does not rule out other causes such as inflammation or contamination. Therefore, repeating the urine culture after discontinuing antibiotics would help confirm whether there is true infection and guide further treatment decisions based on susceptibility results.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of urticaria and angioedema. She has no significant past medical history, but reports having eaten seafood at a restaurant an hour before the symptoms started. On examination, she has swelling around her lips and eyes, and wheals on her arms and legs.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?

A. Administer intramuscular adrenaline
B. Prescribe oral antihistamines
C. Perform skin prick testing for seafood allergy
D. Order serum tryptase levels
E. Refer patient to an allergist

Question
A 50-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of urticaria over the last year. He reports that his symptoms are worse during times of emotional stress or after consuming alcohol or spicy food. He denies any known allergies or use of medications.

Which of the following investigations would be most useful in diagnosing this patient's condition?

A. Skin biopsy
B. Serum IgE levels
C. Patch testing for common allergens
D. Autologous serum skin test
E. Thyroid function tests

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's symptoms suggest chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), which is often idiopathic but can also be associated with autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The autologous serum skin test (ASST) is a diagnostic tool used in patients with suspected CSU, where their own serum is injected into their skin to see if it triggers a wheal and flare response. A positive ASST result supports the diagnosis of CSU.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents with recurrent episodes of urticaria, which she reports have been ongoing for several years. She has no significant past medical history and denies any known allergies or use of medications. On examination, she has multiple erythematous wheals on her arms and legs.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent varicose veins and swelling in both legs for several years. She reports increased difficulty walking long distances due to the heaviness in her legs.
On examination, she has multiple dilated veins over both lower limbs, including the thigh region. Duplex ultrasound confirms incompetence of the great saphenous vein and its tributaries as well as deep venous reflux.
What is the most appropriate management option for this patient? 

A. Venous stripping
B. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)
C. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
D. Foam sclerotherapy
E. Combined superficial and deep venous surgery

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient's symptoms suggest chronic venous insufficiency due to recurrent varicose veins and swelling, which may indicate underlying incompetence of both superficial and deep venous systems. Combined superficial and deep venous surgery is an effective treatment option for patients with significant disease involving both systems who have failed conservative measures or previous interventions such as endovenous therapies or surgical procedures targeting only one system.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 32 weeks gestation with sudden onset of vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. She reports that she has had a low-lying placenta since her first trimester scan, but no further follow-up was arranged by her midwife or obstetrician. On examination, the patient is pale and tachycardic with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. The abdomen is tender on palpation, and fetal heart rate monitoring shows variable decelerations.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Placental abruption
B. Placenta praevia
C. Vasa praevia
D. Uterine rupture
E. Preterm labour

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This scenario describes vasa praevia, which occurs when fetal vessels traverse over the internal cervical os without being protected by Wharton's jelly or umbilical cord vessels within the placenta itself. It can be associated with velamentous cord insertion or succenturiate lobes of placenta and carries a high risk of fetal exsanguination if not detected early.

Question
A 26-year-old primigravida attends for an urgent ultrasound scan at 30 weeks gestation due to concerns about reduced fetal movements and occasional episodes of bright red vaginal bleeding in recent days. The ultrasound report indicates that there is evidence of marginal placenta praevia, but also notes multiple small cystic spaces adjacent to the membranes suggestive of vasa praevia.
What should be the next step in management? 

A. Immediate delivery via Caesarean section
B. Administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity 
C. Expectant management with close surveillance 
D. Transfer to a tertiary centre for specialist intervention 
E. Conservative management until term unless symptoms worsen

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This scenario describes a rare but potentially catastrophic complication of placenta praevia, where fetal vessels are present within the membranes and at risk of rupture with vaginal bleeding or uterine contractions. Management should involve urgent referral to a tertiary centre for specialist intervention, including delivery via Caesarean section if necessary.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents in labour at 36 weeks gestation with spontaneous rupture of membranes and painless vaginal bleeding. She has had an uneventful pregnancy until now, with no history of antepartum haemorrhage or previous Caesarean sections. On examination, the cervix is fully dilated with visible umbilical cord prolapse.
What is the most appropriate immediate management? 

A. Administer tocolytic therapy
B. Perform emergency Caesarean section 
C. Attempt manual reduction of cord prolapse 
D. Apply pressure to presenting part during vaginal delivery 
E. Transfer to theatre for instrumental delivery 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This scenario describes an obstetric emergency known as vasa previa, which requires prompt action to prevent fetal exsanguination and death from compression or laceration of unprotected blood vessels by advancing fetal parts or cervical manipulation during labour. The recommended management involves immediate delivery via Caesarean section under general anaesthesia to minimise maternal stress and allow rapid access to neonatal resuscitation facilities if required.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a history of recurrent episodes of syncope over the past few months. She reports that these episodes occur without any warning signs and are often associated with a feeling of lightheadedness, nausea, and sweating.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with vasovagal syncope, which can be triggered by pain or emotional stress in some individuals.

Question
A 58-year-old man presents to his GP with a non-healing ulcer on his right leg that has been present for the last 6 months. He reports having had recurrent deep vein thromboses in both legs over the past few years, and is currently taking warfarin as prophylaxis against further venous thromboembolism. Examination reveals an ulcer with poorly demarcated edges, located around 2cm below the medial malleolus. There is notable pitting oedema of both lower limbs, and the surrounding skin appears dry and hardened, with brown discolouration. The patient also reports experiencing pain in his legs after walking long distances.

Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate to confirm diagnosis? 

A. Duplex ultrasound
B. Magnetic resonance angiography
C. Computed tomography angiography
D. Venogram
E. Lymphoscintigraphy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: While duplex ultrasound is often used as a first-line investigation for suspected venous ulcers, it may not provide sufficient detail to confirm diagnosis or rule out other underlying pathologies such as arterial disease or lymphatic obstruction. In cases where there is diagnostic uncertainty, venography may be required to visualise the extent of any venous insufficiency or obstruction.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a painful ulcer on her left leg that has been worsening over the last few weeks despite regular dressings and compression bandaging by district nurses at home. She has a history of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was diagnosed approximately five years ago but is well-controlled on metformin monotherapy (HbA1c 7%).

There is also significant surrounding erythema and oedema, with palpable cords in the affected limb.

Which of the following organisms is most likely to be responsible for this patient's infection? 

A. Staphylococcus aureus
B. Streptococcus pyogenes
C. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
D. Escherichia coli
E. Proteus mirabilis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: While venous ulcers are often colonised by a range of commensal bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to be particularly virulent and can cause rapid tissue destruction in immunocompromised patients or those with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.

Question
A 62-year-old man presents to his GP with a non-healing ulcer on his right leg that has been present for several months despite regular dressings at home by district nurses. He reports having had recurrent deep vein thromboses in both legs over the past few years, and is currently taking warfarin as prophylaxis against further venous thromboembolism. Examination reveals an ulcer measuring approximately 3cm x 2cm located around 1cm below the medial malleolus; there is notable pitting oedema of both lower limbs, but no other significant findings on examination.

Which one of the following interventions would be most appropriate as first-line management? 

A. Oral antibiotics 
B. Topical corticosteroids 
C. Surgical debridement 
D. Autologous skin grafting 
E. Compression bandaging 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Compression therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for venous ulcers, as it helps to reduce oedema and promote healing by improving blood flow through damaged veins and reducing hydrostatic pressure within capillaries. Other interventions such as antibiotics or surgical debridement may be required in the presence of infection or necrotic tissue, but should not be considered first-line management.

The presence of anti-HAV IgM antibodies indicates an acute infection with HAV, which is usually self-limiting and does not progress to chronicity.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to his GP with a history of sudden onset painless loss of vision in the left eye, which he noticed on waking up in the morning. He reports that he has been experiencing headaches for the past few weeks and is currently taking medication for hypertension. On examination, visual acuity is reduced in the left eye with an inferior altitudinal defect on confrontation testing. Fundoscopy reveals optic disc swelling with flame-shaped hemorrhages and cotton wool spots.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Ischemic optic neuropathy
B. Optic neuritis 
C. Central retinal artery occlusion
D. Papilledema 
E. Glaucoma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with papilledema, which refers to optic disc swelling due to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). It can be caused by various conditions such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, brain tumors or abscesses, meningitis or encephalitis, hydrocephalus, etc. In this case, the patient's history of headaches and hypertension raises suspicion for raised ICP as a cause of papilledema.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents to her ophthalmologist with complaints of gradual loss of peripheral vision in both eyes over several months' duration. She also reports seeing halos around lights at night and occasional episodes of headache and nausea/vomiting without any obvious triggers. On examination, there are bilateral temporal visual field defects on confrontation testing along with elevated intraocular pressures (IOPs) measured by tonometry.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Primary open-angle glaucoma
B. Normal-tension glaucoma 
C. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
D. Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma 
E. Pigmentary glaucoma

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), which is the most common type of glaucoma and a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. It typically presents as a chronic, asymptomatic disease that gradually impairs peripheral vision due to progressive damage to the optic nerve head caused by elevated IOPs. However, some patients may experience symptoms such as halos around lights, headache, or nausea/vomiting during acute episodes of IOP elevation. POAG can be diagnosed based on characteristic visual field defects and optic disc changes seen on ophthalmoscopic examination.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents to his neurologist with complaints of recurrent episodes of transient monocular vision loss in his left eye over the past few months' duration. He describes it as a curtain-like shade descending from above that lasts for several minutes before resolving spontaneously. He has no significant medical history but reports smoking cigarettes regularly for the past 10 years.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Retinal migraine
B. Amaurosis fugax 
C. Optic neuritis
D. Central retinal vein occlusion 
E. Ischemic optic neuropathy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with amaurosis fugax, which refers to temporary loss of vision in one eye due to ischemia of the retina or optic nerve caused by emboli or stenosis in the ophthalmic artery or its branches. It typically presents as a curtain-like shade descending from above that lasts for several minutes before resolving spontaneously without any residual deficits. Risk factors include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, carotid artery disease, etc. Other causes of transient monocular vision loss should also be considered and ruled out based on clinical history, examination, and investigations.

Explanation: The combination of low serum phosphate levels, high alkaline phosphatase levels, and clinical features suggests osteomalacia as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 25-year-old pregnant woman comes for a routine antenatal check-up at 20 weeks gestation.She reports feeling tired all the time despite getting enough sleep every night.The obstetrician orders blood tests, which reveal a low serum ferritin level.
Which of the following vitamins is required for optimal absorption of iron? 
A. Vitamin A
B. Vitamin B6
C. Vitamin C
D. Vitamin D
E. Vitamin K

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Vitamin C enhances the absorption of non-heme iron from plant-based foods and supplements by reducing it to its ferrous form, which is more readily absorbed in the small intestine.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents to his GP with fatigue and shortness of breath. His blood tests show a macrocytic anaemia, low vitamin B12 levels, and normal folate levels. The patient has no history of alcoholism or malabsorption disorders. He is started on intramuscular vitamin B12 injections but after several weeks there is no improvement in his symptoms. Further investigations reveal that the patient has an autoimmune disorder affecting the parietal cells of the stomach.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pernicious anaemia
B. Folate deficiency anaemia 
C. Iron-deficiency anaemia 
D. Thalassemia 
E. Sickle cell anaemia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Pernicious anaemia is caused by an autoimmune disorder that affects the parietal cells of the stomach, leading to decreased production of intrinsic factor which is necessary for absorption of vitamin B12 from food sources. This leads to a deficiency in vitamin B12 which causes macrocytic anaemia, fatigue, and neurological symptoms such as tingling and numbness in the extremities.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with weakness and difficulty walking for several months. She reports feeling tired all the time and experiencing pins and needles sensations in her hands and feet. Her blood tests show a macrocytic anaemia, low vitamin B12 levels, and normal folate levels.

What additional test should be ordered? 

A. Serum homocysteine level
B. Serum methylmalonic acid level
C. Serum ferritin level
D. HbA1c level
E. Thyroid function tests

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In cases where there is suspicion of vitamin B12 deficiency despite normal serum folate levels, measurement of serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) can help confirm the diagnosis. MMA is a metabolite that accumulates in the body when there is a deficiency of vitamin B12, and its levels are elevated in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with fatigue and difficulty concentrating. His blood tests show a macrocytic anaemia, low vitamin B12 levels, and normal folate levels. The patient reports no history of alcoholism or malabsorption disorders but has been taking metformin for several years for type 2 diabetes.

What is the most likely cause of his vitamin B12 deficiency? 

A. Pernicious anaemia
B. Folate deficiency 
C. Iron-deficiency anaemia 
D. Metformin-induced malabsorption 
E. Thalassemia

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Metformin can interfere with the absorption of vitamin B12 by inhibiting calcium-dependent membrane action in the ileum, leading to decreased uptake of vitamin B12 from food sources. This can result in a deficiency of vitamin B12 over time, especially in patients who have been taking metformin for several years.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and distension. He reports a history of constipation for several days, but now he is unable to pass any stools or flatus. On examination, his abdomen is tender to palpation and there is no bowel sounds audible. An abdominal X-ray reveals dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels. CT scan confirms the diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus.
What is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Endoscopic decompression
B. Laparotomy
C. Intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement only
D. Barium enema reduction
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The initial management of sigmoid volvulus includes resuscitation with intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement followed by attempts at non-operative reduction using barium enema or flexible sigmoidoscopy.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and constipation over the past few months that have been increasing in frequency and severity over time. She has lost weight unintentionally despite having a good appetite and denies any rectal bleeding or change in bowel habits.
On examination, she has diffuse tenderness on palpation without rebound tenderness or guarding.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Intestinal obstruction 
B. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
C. Colonic diverticulitis 
D. Sigmoid volvulus 
E. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests colonic diverticulitis as it commonly presents with left lower quadrant pain associated with fever, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, altered bowel habit including diarrhea/constipation/bloating/gas passage difficulties.

Question
A 60-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He has a history of chronic constipation and has been taking laxatives for several years. On examination, his abdomen is distended with diffuse tenderness on palpation. An abdominal X-ray reveals dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Sigmoid volvulus
B. Colonic obstruction 
C. Small bowel obstruction 
D. Intussusception 
E. Appendicitis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests small bowel obstruction as it commonly presents with colicky abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, obstipation or diarrhea, and abdominal distension associated with hyperactive bowel sounds in early stages followed by silent abdomen in later stages due to paralysis of gut wall musculature leading to decreased peristalsis and gas accumulation in the intestine causing pressure-induced ischemia and necrosis if not treated promptly.

Question
A 36-year-old woman who is 30 weeks pregnant presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of dyspnoea, chest pain and coughing up blood. She has a history of previous DVTs and pulmonary embolism (PE). On examination, she appears anxious and tachypneic with oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Her vital signs are otherwise stable.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. Immediate transfer to ICU for intubation and mechanical ventilation
B. Administer thrombolytic therapy
C. Start therapeutic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
D. Perform CT pulmonary angiogram before initiating any treatment
E. Administer prophylactic dose LMWH

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient has symptoms suggestive of a PE which can be life-threatening in pregnancy. The first step in management should be to start therapeutic dose anticoagulation with LMWH without waiting for confirmation by imaging studies as delay in treatment can worsen outcomes.

Question
A 29-year-old primigravida at 34 weeks gestation presents to the labour ward with decreased foetal movements over the last few hours along with mild abdominal discomfort but no vaginal bleeding or discharge. On examination, her vital signs are stable, but there is reduced variability in foetal heart rate tracing.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Admit for cardiotocography monitoring only 
B. Admit for urgent delivery via caesarean section 
C. Admit for induction of labour 
D. Discharge home after reassuring ultrasound scan 
E. Admit for IV corticosteroids and monitoring

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Decreased foetal movements require further assessment including cardiotocography monitoring to assess foetal wellbeing and detect any abnormalities that may indicate an increased risk of vTE. If there are any concerns, further investigations and interventions may be required.

Question
A 32-year-old woman who is 2 weeks postpartum presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery at term without any significant medical history or risk factors for vTE. On examination, she appears anxious and tachypneic with oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Her vital signs are otherwise stable.

What is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Administer thrombolytic therapy 
B. Start therapeutic dose LMWH 
C. Perform CT pulmonary angiogram before initiating any treatment 
D. Administer prophylactic dose LMWH 
E. Discharge home after reassuring ultrasound scan

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient has symptoms suggestive of a PE which can occur in the postpartum period despite being low-risk for vTE during pregnancy. The first step in management should be to start therapeutic dose anticoagulation with LMWH without waiting for confirmation by imaging studies as delay in treatment can worsen outcomes.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse presents to the emergency department with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. He has been drinking heavily for the past few weeks and has lost a significant amount of weight. On examination, he is disorientated and unable to follow simple commands. His gait is unsteady, and he has difficulty standing upright without support. His eye movements are limited in all directions.

Which of the following tests would be most helpful in confirming the diagnosis?

A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain
B. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head
C. Serum thiamine levels
D. Lumbar puncture
E. Electroencephalogram (EEG)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Wernicke's encephalopathy is caused by thiamine deficiency, which can occur due to chronic alcoholism or malnutrition. The diagnosis is usually clinical but can be confirmed by measuring serum thiamine levels, which are typically low in affected individuals.

Question
A 62-year-old woman with a history of alcohol dependence presents with acute onset confusion and visual hallucinations. She also complains of weakness on her left side and difficulty speaking coherently. Her vital signs are stable, but she appears agitated and disorientated.

On examination, she has horizontal nystagmus, dysarthria, and left-sided hemiparesis.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acute stroke
B. Alcohol withdrawal delirium
C. Wernicke's encephalopathy
D. Hepatic encephalopathy
E. Carbon monoxide poisoning

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is commonly seen in individuals with chronic alcoholism who have poor nutritional intake. The classic triad of symptoms includes confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, but other neurological deficits such as hemiparesis can also occur.

Question
A 38-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse presents to the emergency department with acute onset confusion and seizures. He has been drinking heavily for the past few days and has not eaten anything during this time. On examination, he is disorientated and agitated, with no focal neurological deficits.

Which of the following investigations would be most helpful in confirming the diagnosis?

A. Serum ammonia levels
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain
C. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head
D. Lumbar puncture
E. Electroencephalogram (EEG)

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of alcohol withdrawal delirium or Wernicke's encephalopathy, both of which can cause seizures and confusion in individuals with chronic alcoholism. An EEG can help differentiate between these two conditions by showing characteristic changes in brain wave patterns associated with each condition.

Question
A 2-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department with a persistent cough, which has been present for two weeks. The baby was born at term and had no significant perinatal history. The mother reports that the child has not received any vaccinations yet. On examination, the infant appears well but has a harsh cough with whooping sounds and post-tussive vomiting. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral crepitations.

What is the most appropriate initial management plan? 

A. Admit to hospital for intravenous antibiotics
B. Prescribe oral erythromycin 
C. Prescribe oral azithromycin 
D. Administer nebulised salbutamol 
E. No treatment needed

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Infants under six months of age are at high risk of severe complications from pertussis infection, including apnoea, pneumonia and encephalopathy; therefore prompt treatment is essential in this age group. Oral erythromycin should be prescribed as it is effective against Bordetella pertussis and reduces transmission of the disease.

Question
A 7-year-old boy presents to his GP with a three-week history of a dry cough that has become more frequent over time, especially at night-time when he wakes up gasping for air after prolonged coughing fits lasting several minutes each time. He denies any fever or other respiratory symptoms such as runny nose or sore throat. His vaccination record shows that he received all his childhood immunisations on schedule.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Asthma exacerbation
B. Bronchiectasis
C. Cystic fibrosis
D. Pertussis infection
E.Tuberculosis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Chronic cough lasting longer than four weeks in children may indicate underlying lung pathology such as bronchiectasis, particularly if there are recurrent chest infections, haemoptysis or digital clubbing. Pertussis infection is less likely in a fully vaccinated child who has received all his childhood immunisations on schedule.

Question
A 14-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a two-week history of coughing fits that have become more frequent and severe over time, causing her to vomit after prolonged bouts of coughing. She reports no fever or other respiratory symptoms such as runny nose or sore throat. Her vaccination record shows that she received her last pertussis booster at age 5 years.

What is the most appropriate management plan? 

A. Prescribe oral azithromycin 
B. Prescribe oral erythromycin 
C. Administer nebulised salbutamol 
D. Admit to hospital for intravenous antibiotics
E.No treatment needed

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Adolescents and adults with suspected pertussis should receive macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin within three weeks of symptom onset to reduce transmission and severity of illness, even if they have previously been vaccinated against pertussis. Erythromycin can also be used but may cause gastrointestinal side effects.

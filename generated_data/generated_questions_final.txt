1. A 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal distension and pain for the past week. She reports a history of constipation, but denies any recent changes in bowel habits or blood in her stool. Her medical history is significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease stage III. On examination, she has a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness on palpation and decreased bowel sounds. Laboratory studies reveal an elevated white blood cell count and serum creatinine level. Abdominal x-ray shows dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels suggestive of small bowel obstruction. Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step? 

A. Emergent laparotomy 
B. Conservative management with nasogastric decompression and intravenous fluids 
C. Colonoscopy 
D. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis 
E. Upper endoscopy 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with small bowel obstruction, which can result from various causes including adhesions, hernias, tumors, or inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitis. Initial management should include nasogastric decompression to relieve pressure within the gastrointestinal tract and intravenous fluids to maintain hydration status while awaiting further diagnostic evaluation.

2. A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of abdominal bloating that has been present for several months along with intermittent diarrhea alternating with constipation. He reports no weight loss or rectal bleeding but does have occasional nausea after meals without vomiting or early satiety. His medical history is notable for gastroesophageal reflux disease treated with proton pump inhibitors and anxiety disorder treated with benzodiazepines as needed; he also smokes one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years and drinks alcohol socially on weekends only. Physical examination reveals a soft, nontender abdomen with no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory studies including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel are within normal limits. Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step? 

A. Colonoscopy 
B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis 
C. Upper endoscopy 
D. Stool testing for occult blood and parasites 
E. Referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest possible irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is characterized by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits in the absence of any organic disease process. While there is no definitive diagnostic test for IBS, referral to a gastroenterologist may be warranted for further evaluation and management.

3. A 35-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of increasing abdominal distension over the past several months along with early satiety, nausea, and occasional vomiting after meals; she also reports constipation alternating with diarrhea but denies rectal bleeding or weight loss. Her medical history includes polycystic ovary syndrome treated with oral contraceptives, depression treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anxiety disorder treated with benzodiazepines as needed; she does not smoke or drink alcohol. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen that is tender on palpation without rebound or guarding; there are no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly noted. Laboratory studies including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel are within normal limits except for an elevated CA-125 level at 75 U/mL (normal range < 35 U/mL). Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step? 

A. Abdominal ultrasound 
B. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis 
C. Colonoscopy 
D. Upper endoscopy 
E. Referral to a gynecologic oncologist for further evaluation 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and elevated CA-125 level raise concern for possible ovarian cancer, which can present with nonspecific abdominal symptoms such as bloating, early satiety, and distension. While imaging studies may be helpful in evaluating the extent of disease involvement, referral to a gynecologic oncologist is warranted for further evaluation and management.

4. A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of worsening abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation. She has a past medical history significant for ovarian cancer treated with chemotherapy and surgery 5 years ago. On physical examination, there is a palpable mass in the left lower quadrant of her abdomen that is tender to touch. CT scan shows a large cystic mass with multiple septations and solid components within it. The radiologist suspects an ovarian neoplasm but cannot rule out other possibilities such as mesenteric cyst or lymphoma. What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Proceed with surgical resection 
B. Order tumor markers CA-125 and CEA 
C. Perform fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) under ultrasound guidance
D. Obtain PET/CT scan to evaluate for metastatic disease 
E. Repeat imaging in 3 months

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Given the patient's history of ovarian cancer, this new abdominal mass raises concern for recurrence or metastasis of her malignancy; however, other diagnoses are also possible based on imaging findings alone. FNAB can provide diagnostic information without subjecting the patient to unnecessary surgery if the lesion turns out to be benign.

5. A 48-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of vague abdominal discomfort and early satiety over the past few weeks. He denies any weight loss, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits. His past medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia which are well-controlled with medications. Physical examination reveals a non-tender firm mass in the epigastric region that does not move with respiration or change in position. Laboratory studies including liver function tests are normal except for mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase level at 140 U/L (normal range <120 U/L). Upper endoscopy shows extrinsic compression of the gastric antrum by a submucosal mass. CT scan confirms the presence of a 6 cm heterogenous enhancing mass in the head of pancreas with no evidence of local invasion or distant metastasis. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
B. Neuroendocrine tumor (NET) 
C. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) 
D. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)
E. Lymphoma

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: SPNs are rare pancreatic tumors that typically occur in young women and have a low malignant potential. They can present as incidental findings on imaging studies or cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or palpable mass depending on their size and location within the pancreas.

6. A 55-year-old man presents to his gastroenterologist for follow-up after undergoing colonoscopy which revealed multiple polyps in his colon including one large sessile polyp measuring 3 cm in diameter located at the hepatic flexure. Biopsy results showed tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia but no invasive carcinoma was identified. The patient has no personal history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease but his father died from colon cancer at age 60 years old. He is otherwise healthy and takes only aspirin daily for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Physical examination is unremarkable except for mild tenderness over the right upper quadrant of abdomen where the liver edge is palpable below the costal margin. Laboratory tests show normal complete blood count, liver function tests, and carcinoembryonic antigen level at 2 ng/mL (normal range <5 ng/mL). Abdominal ultrasound reveals a hypoechoic solid mass measuring 4 cm Ã— 5 cm arising from segment VI of liver. What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Refer to hepatobiliary surgeon for liver resection 
B. Order triple-phase CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast 
C. Perform MRI of liver with gadolinium-based contrast agent 
D. Obtain PET/CT scan to evaluate for metastatic disease
E. Repeat abdominal ultrasound in 3 months

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient has a high-risk adenomatous polyp in his colon and a solid hepatic mass suspicious for metastasis from colorectal cancer, although other primary malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma cannot be excluded based on imaging alone. MRI provides better soft tissue resolution than CT and can help distinguish between benign and malignant lesions based on their enhancement pattern and diffusion characteristics.

7. A 35-year-old woman presents to her gynecologist with abnormal vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. She has a history of multiple sexual partners, inconsistent condom use, and smoking for the past 10 years. Her last Pap smear was normal 2 years ago. On examination, there is cervical motion tenderness, bilateral adnexal tenderness, and a palpable mass in the right adnexa. The Pap smear shows atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS). The patient undergoes colposcopy, which reveals an abnormal transformation zone with punctation and mosaic patterns. Biopsy results show adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) involving the endocervical canal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Repeat Pap smear in 6 months 
B. Perform loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP)
C. Refer for hysterectomy 
D. Administer chemotherapy and radiation therapy
E. Offer fertility-sparing surgery

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's AGUS on Pap smear requires further evaluation with colposcopy due to its association with AIS or invasive adenocarcinoma of the cervix or uterus.

8. A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for routine health maintenance examination and Pap smear screening test. She reports no symptoms but has had two sexual partners over the past year without consistent condom use. Her medical history is unremarkable except for occasional heavy menstrual periods that she manages with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Physical examination is normal except for mild cervical motion tenderness on bimanual exam and a bulky uterus on pelvic ultrasound scan measuring 12 cm x 9 cm x 8 cm with heterogeneous echogenicity suggestive of leiomyomas or fibroids.

A. Repeat Pap smear in 6 months 
B. Perform colposcopy and biopsy
C. Order pelvic MRI for further evaluation of uterine fibroids 
D. Refer for hysterectomy 
E. Administer HPV vaccine

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's LSIL on Pap smear requires further evaluation with colposcopy due to its association with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cervical cancer.

9. A 40-year-old woman presents to her gynecologist with postcoital bleeding, vaginal discharge, and lower abdominal pain for several weeks. She has a history of smoking for the past 20 years, occasional alcohol use, and no significant medical history except for an episode of chlamydia infection treated successfully 5 years ago. On examination, there are multiple friable lesions on the cervix that bleed easily on contact and foul-smelling purulent discharge from the cervical os. The Pap smear shows high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) with negative HPV DNA test results but endocervical glandular involvement suggestive of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). Biopsy results confirm AIS involving both squamous and glandular epithelium extending into the stroma without invasion beyond it. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Repeat Pap smear in 6 months 
B. Perform loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP)
C. Refer for hysterectomy 
D. Administer chemotherapy and radiation therapy
E. Offer fertility-sparing surgery

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's HSIL on Pap smear and AIS confirmed by biopsy require definitive treatment such as radical hysterectomy or trachelectomy due to the high risk of invasive adenocarcinoma.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department after being involved in a house fire where he sustained extensive burns over his entire body surface area (BSA). He is intubated due to airway compromise and requires fluid resuscitation according to Parkland formula guidelines.
The patient weighs 70kg and has an estimated BSA burned of 60%. How much fluid should be administered within the first 8 hours? 

A) 10,500 mL
B) 14,000 mL
C) 18,900 mL
D) 21,000 mL
E) 24,500 mL

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: According to the Parkland formula, fluid resuscitation should be calculated as follows:
4mL x body weight (kg) x % BSA burned = total volume of fluid required in the first 24 hours.
Half of this volume is given within the first 8 hours. Therefore,
2mL x body weight (kg) x % BSA burned = total volume of fluid required in the first 8 hours.
Substituting values into the equation gives:
2mL x 70kg x 60% = 8,400mL for the first eight hours.
Therefore, a total of approximately 18,900ml should be administered within the first eight hours.

Question
You are working in the emergency department when a 60-year-old man is brought in by ambulance after collapsing at home. The patient has no significant past medical history and was found to be pulseless and not breathing by his wife who immediately commenced CPR. On arrival, the patient remains unresponsive with no signs of life. The cardiac monitor shows asystole.

What should be the next step in managing this patient? Describe your approach to resuscitation.

A. Administer adrenaline
B. Perform intubation
C. Insert intraosseous access
D. Commence chest compressions
E. Administer amiodarone

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In managing a patient with cardiorespiratory arrest, it is important to follow the advanced life support algorithm which involves immediate commencement of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with a ratio of 30 compressions to two breaths until further interventions can be carried out. Therefore, option D is correct as it recommends commencing chest compressions immediately upon arrival on scene.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after being found unconscious at home by her husband who started CPR before calling an ambulance. She has been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia but otherwise has no significant past medical history or allergies to medications. Her initial ECG rhythm showed ventricular fibrillation which was successfully defibrillated using one shock from a defibrillator.

What medication(s) would you administer during subsequent rounds of advanced cardiovascular life support? 

A. Adrenaline only 
B. Amiodarone only 
C. Lidocaine only 
D. Adenosine followed by amiodarone if required 
E. Atropine followed by adrenaline if required

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: After successful defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation, administration of anti-arrhythmic medication is recommended to prevent recurrence of the arrhythmia. Amiodarone is the preferred anti-arrhythmic agent in this situation and should be administered as a bolus dose followed by an infusion.

Question
You are working on a surgical ward when you hear a code blue being called from one of the rooms. Upon arrival, you find that a 70-year-old man who had undergone surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair has suffered cardiac arrest. The patient was intubated prior to surgery and remains intubated with no signs of life on arrival. The cardiac monitor shows pulseless electrical activity (PEA).

What would be your approach to managing this patient? 

A. Administer adrenaline 
B. Perform defibrillation 
C. Check for reversible causes such as hypovolemia or tension pneumothorax
D. Commence chest compressions 
E. Administer amiodarone

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Pulseless electrical activity (PEA) refers to organized electrical activity without detectable mechanical contractions of the heart, which can occur due to various underlying causes such as hypovolemia, tension pneumothorax, tamponade, pulmonary embolism or acidosis among others. Therefore, it is important to check for these reversible causes before proceeding with further interventions such as administration of medications or defibrillation. Option C is correct as it recommends checking for reversible causes first before proceeding with any other intervention.

Question
A 62-year-old woman presents to her GP with a change in bowel habit, reporting that she has been experiencing looser stools and more frequent bowel movements over the past few months. She also reports some abdominal discomfort and bloating. The GP takes a thorough history and notes that the patient has a family history of colorectal cancer, as well as a personal history of smoking and heavy alcohol consumption. On examination, there is tenderness on palpation of the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.

Which one of the following investigations would be most appropriate at this stage? 

A. Fecal occult blood test
B. Flexible sigmoidoscopy 
C. CT colonography
D. Colonoscopy 
E. MRI enterography

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Given the patient's age, symptoms, risk factors and physical findings, further investigation for possible colorectal cancer is warranted. While fecal occult blood testing can be useful in screening for colorectal cancer, it may not detect all cases and should not replace diagnostic imaging or endoscopic evaluation when indicated. Flexible sigmoidoscopy only examines part of the colon and may miss lesions located elsewhere; therefore, full colonoscopy is preferred if there are any concerning features on initial assessment such as those described here.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with recurrent episodes of diarrhea alternating with constipation over the past year, along with crampy abdominal pain relieved by defecation and passage of mucus per rectum. He denies any recent travel or changes in diet but reports feeling stressed due to work-related issues lately.
On examination, there are no significant findings except mild tenderness on deep palpation of the lower abdomen.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
B. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
C. Colorectal cancer
D. Diverticulitis
E. Intestinal obstruction

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits, in the absence of any organic cause. IBS is a common condition that affects up to 20% of the population and can be triggered or worsened by stress, anxiety or depression. There are no specific diagnostic tests for IBS; therefore, a thorough history and physical examination should be performed to rule out other causes of gastrointestinal symptoms.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP with a complaint of rectal bleeding and diarrhea over the past week. She reports passing bright red blood per rectum along with loose stools several times a day, without any mucus or pus. She denies any abdominal pain, fever, weight loss or recent travel.

Which one of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Stool culture 
B. Fecal calprotectin test 
C. Colonoscopy 
D. Abdominal ultrasound 
E. CT enterography

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Given the patient's age and symptoms suggestive of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, colonoscopy is the most appropriate investigation at this stage to evaluate for possible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infectious colitis or colorectal cancer as potential causes. While stool cultures may identify bacterial pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis, they are less useful in chronic cases such as this one where an inflammatory process is suspected instead. Fecal calprotectin testing can help distinguish between IBD and functional disorders like IBS but does not provide definitive diagnosis on its own and should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings and endoscopic evaluation if needed. Imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT enterography may be useful in some cases but are less sensitive and specific than colonoscopy for detecting mucosal abnormalities.

Question
A 32-year-old woman gives birth to her second child, a baby girl weighing 3.8 kg via normal vaginal delivery. The mother has had previous breastfeeding experience with her first child and wishes to breastfeed this baby as well. However, she experiences severe nipple pain during breastfeeding which makes it difficult for her to continue feeding the baby. She also notices that the baby is not gaining weight as expected and seems unsettled after feeds.

What is the most likely cause of nipple pain in this case? 

A. Incorrect positioning of the baby
B. Mastitis
C. Raynaud's phenomenon 
D. Thrush infection 
E. Tongue-tie

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Nipple pain can be caused by various factors including incorrect positioning of the baby, mastitis, Raynaud's phenomenon, thrush infection or tongue-tie. In this case, since the mother has previous breastfeeding experience and still experiences severe nipple pain along with poor weight gain in the baby, thrush infection should be suspected as it commonly presents with these symptoms.

Question
A 29-year-old primigravida gives birth via emergency caesarean section at 36 weeks gestation due to fetal distress. The baby weighs 2 kg and requires admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for respiratory support but otherwise recovers well within a week and is discharged home with his mother who wishes to breastfeed him exclusively.

At his two-week check-up appointment with his GP, he is noted to have lost more than 10% of his birth weight despite frequent feeds from his mother every two hours day and night.

What could be possible causes of inadequate milk production? 

A. Breast hypoplasia
B. Hormonal imbalances
C. Insufficient glandular tissue
D. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Inadequate milk production can be due to various factors including breast hypoplasia, hormonal imbalances, insufficient glandular tissue and PCOS. Breast hypoplasia is a condition where there is underdevelopment of the mammary glands which results in inadequate milk production. Hormonal imbalances such as thyroid disorders or high levels of prolactin hormone can also affect lactation. Insufficient glandular tissue refers to the lack of functional mammary glands which affects milk production. Women with PCOS may have difficulty producing enough milk due to hormonal imbalances.

Question
A 26-year-old woman gives birth via normal vaginal delivery to her first child who weighs 3 kg at birth and has a normal NIPE examination. The mother wishes to exclusively breastfeed her baby but experiences difficulties with latching on and nipple pain during feeds. She seeks advice from a midwife-led breastfeeding clinic who provides support and guidance on correct positioning and attachment techniques.

However, despite these interventions, she continues to experience difficulties with breastfeeding and notices that her baby is not gaining weight as expected.

What could be possible causes of poor weight gain? 

A. Tongue-tie
B. Cleft lip/palate
C. Reflux disease 
D. Allergy/intolerance 
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Poor weight gain in breastfed babies can be caused by various factors including tongue-tie, cleft lip/palate, reflux disease or allergy/intolerance to certain foods consumed by the mother which are passed onto the baby through breastmilk. Tongue-tie is a condition where the frenulum (the membrane that attaches the tongue to the floor of mouth) is too short or tight which makes it difficult for the baby to latch on properly leading to poor feeding and slow weight gain. Cleft lip/palate can interfere with the baby's ability to suck effectively leading to poor feeding. Reflux disease can cause discomfort and pain during feeds which may result in the baby refusing to feed or vomiting after feeds. Allergy/intolerance to certain foods consumed by the mother can also lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as colic, diarrhoea or constipation which can affect weight gain in babies.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset vertical diplopia and a headache that started two days ago. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is currently taking aspirin for prophylaxis against stroke.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acute demyelinating optic neuritis
B. Cavernous sinus thrombosis
C. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO)
D. Myasthenia gravis
E. Sixth nerve palsy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can cause multiple cranial nerve palsies including the sixth nerve palsy seen here. Other causes such as INO or myasthenia gravis would typically present with more specific patterns of ocular motility deficits while acute demyelinating optic neuritis would present with visual loss rather than diplopia.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the GP with a history of recurrent episodes of dizziness for the past 6 months. She describes her symptoms as a sensation of spinning, which lasts for several minutes and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and sweating. The patient reports that these episodes occur spontaneously and are not related to any particular activity or position change. There is no hearing loss, tinnitus, or headache associated with these episodes. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

What would be the most appropriate initial investigation?

A. MRI brain
B. CT head
C. Audiometry
D. Electroencephalogram (EEG)
E. Echocardiography

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of peripheral vertigo due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or vestibular migraine; however, other causes such as cerebrovascular disease should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. An initial imaging study such as CT head can help rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain that may be causing the symptoms.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of dizziness and unsteadiness while walking for the past few weeks.

Which one of the following diagnoses should be considered as part of this patient's differential? 

A. Bipolar disorder type I
B. Schizophrenia spectrum disorder
C. Borderline personality disorder
D. Substance-induced mood disorder
E. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a possible psychotic illness given the presence of auditory hallucinations and delusions of grandeur alongside elevated mood symptoms like increased energy levels and reduced need for sleep. While bipolar disorder may also present similarly, the absence of any previous episodes or family history makes it less likely. Substance-induced mood disorder and ADHD are also unlikely given the lack of substance use or attentional difficulties.

Question
A 25-year-old man with a known diagnosis of bipolar disorder type II presents to his psychiatrist with complaints of persistent elated mood despite being on stable doses of lamotrigine for several months. He reports feeling "too happy" and having racing thoughts that he cannot control, making it difficult to focus on work or other activities. On examination, he is found to have increased psychomotor activity and distractibility.

Which one of the following treatment options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Increase dose of lamotrigine
B. Add an atypical antipsychotic
C. Switch to carbamazepine
D. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
E. Refer for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest a possible hypomanic episode in bipolar disorder type II, which may require additional pharmacological intervention beyond lamotrigine alone. Adding an atypical antipsychotic like quetiapine or risperidone can help stabilize mood and reduce symptoms like racing thoughts and distractibility without significantly increasing risk of adverse effects compared to other medications like lithium or valproate. CBT may also be useful as adjunctive therapy but is not typically used as first-line treatment for acute manic/hypomanic episodes, while ECT is reserved for severe cases where other treatments have failed or are contraindicated due to medical comorbidities.

Question
A couple presents to the genetic counselling clinic with concerns about their family history of a possible genetic disorder. The husband's brother was diagnosed with an autosomal dominant condition resulting from a pathogenic variant in the BRCA1 gene, while the wife's mother had breast cancer at a young age. They are both worried about their risk of developing the condition and passing it on to their children.
What is the likelihood that their future children will inherit the condition? What are the options available for them to reduce their risk? How can they ensure that their children receive appropriate screening? 

A. Genetic testing for both parents
B. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)
C. Adoption
D. Surrogacy
E. No action

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The couple has a 50% chance of passing on the BRCA1 mutation or other related mutations to each child they have, which increases their risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers later in life. PGD allows embryos to be screened for these mutations before implantation, reducing the risk of passing on the mutation to future generations.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to her GP concerned about her family history of Huntington's disease (HD). Her father was diagnosed with HD at age 45, and she wants to know if she is at risk of inheriting this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.

A. Carrier screening for both parents
B. Prenatal diagnosis 
C. Newborn screening 
D. Referral to specialist haematology clinic 
E. No action

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: SCD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HBB gene that codes for beta-globin chains in haemoglobin. Carriers have one normal and one mutated copy of the gene, while individuals with two copies of the mutated gene develop SCD. Prenatal diagnosis allows for detection of SCD in utero through chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, which can help parents make informed decisions about pregnancy management and planning for appropriate care after birth.

Question

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to the emergency department with palpitations and shortness of breath. On examination, you hear a loud holosystolic murmur over the apex that radiates to the axilla. The patient is also found to have an elevated jugular venous pressure and hepatomegaly. An echocardiogram reveals severe mitral regurgitation with left ventricular dilatation.

Which of the following statements regarding this condition is true? 

A. Mitral valve prolapse is a common cause of this condition
B. This condition can be treated with beta-blockers alone
C. Surgical intervention should be considered in patients who are symptomatic or have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction
D. Infective endocarditis prophylaxis is not necessary for patients with this condition
E. This condition is typically asymptomatic until late stages

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Severe mitral regurgitation can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, and even heart failure if left untreated. Beta-blockers may help control symptoms but surgical intervention (valve repair or replacement) is often required in symptomatic patients or those with evidence of left ventricular dysfunction on imaging studies. Patients with mitral regurgitation are at increased risk for infective endocarditis and therefore require prophylaxis before certain medical procedures.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of chest pain that occurs during exertion and resolves with rest. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but denies any previous cardiac events or surgeries.

On examination, you hear a harsh systolic ejection murmur over the right upper sternal border that radiates to the carotids bilaterally.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Mitral stenosis 
B. Aortic stenosis 
C. Tricuspid regurgitation 
D. Pulmonic stenosis
E. Mitral regurgitation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Aortic stenosis is a common valvular disorder that typically presents in older adults with symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, and syncope on exertion. The classic murmur associated with aortic stenosis is a harsh systolic ejection murmur heard best over the right upper sternal border that radiates to the carotids bilaterally. Mitral stenosis is characterized by a mid-diastolic rumble heard loudest at the apex, while mitral regurgitation produces a pansystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents for her routine physical examination. She has no significant medical history and takes no medications.

On examination, you hear a soft grade I/VI systolic ejection murmur over the left lower sternal border that disappears when she stands up.

Which of the following statements regarding this condition is true? 

A. This condition requires immediate referral to cardiology for further evaluation
B. It is commonly associated with underlying structural heart disease
C. It may be exacerbated by fever or exercise
D. Treatment involves surgical intervention in all cases
E. It carries an increased risk of sudden cardiac death

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: A soft grade I/VI systolic ejection murmur heard at the left lower sternal border that disappears when standing up is likely an innocent (functional) heart murmur, which does not require immediate referral to cardiology or treatment unless there are other concerning findings on examination or imaging studies. Innocent murmurs are common in children and young adults and are usually benign without any underlying structural heart disease or increased risk of sudden cardiac death. They may be exacerbated by fever or exercise but typically disappear with age.

The GP orders some investigations including a urinalysis, basic metabolic panel, lipid profile, and electrocardiogram (ECG). The results show normal urine analysis, serum sodium of 142 mmol/L, potassium of 4.5 mmol/L, creatinine of 90 μmol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60 ml/min/1.72m2, total cholesterol of 6.8 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 4.2 mmol/L and triglycerides of 2.3 mmol/L.

What would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's hypertension? 

A. Increase the dose of ramipril
B. Add hydrochlorothiazide to current therapy 
C. Switch from amlodipine to verapamil 
D. Refer for renal artery stenosis evaluation 
E. Start spironolactone

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient has resistant hypertension as evidenced by persistent elevation in blood pressure despite being on two antihypertensive medications at adequate doses including an ACE inhibitor and calcium channel blocker; therefore adding another class such as thiazide diuretic is recommended according to NICE guidelines.

Question
A 70-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion over the past few weeks along with uncontrolled hypertension despite taking amlodipine and lisinopril. She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3. On examination, she appears pale with mild pedal edema and an elevated blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg. The GP orders some investigations including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, lipid profile, echocardiogram, and renal ultrasound. The results show hemoglobin of 8 g/dL, serum creatinine of 150 μmol/L, eGFR of 35 ml/min/1.72m2, total cholesterol of 5.6 mmol/L with LDL cholesterol of 3.4 mmol/L.

What is the most likely cause for this patient's symptoms?

Question
A 50-year-old male patient presents to his primary care physician with complaints of chronic low back pain that has been present for several years. He reports difficulty sleeping and performing activities of daily living due to the pain. On examination, there is tenderness over the lumbar spine and reduced range of motion in all planes. X-ray shows degenerative changes at multiple levels consistent with osteoarthritis.

Which one of the following interventions would be most appropriate? 

A. Prescription of opioids for long-term pain management
B. Referral to a physical therapist for core strengthening exercises 
C. Administration of epidural steroid injections every 3 months 
D. Surgical intervention with spinal fusion 
E. Application of heat therapy alone

Correct Answer: B 

Explanation: Referral to a physical therapist for core strengthening exercises is recommended as first-line treatment for chronic low back pain due to degenerative changes such as osteoarthritis. Opioids should be avoided if possible due to their potential for addiction and other adverse effects, while epidural steroid injections may provide short-term relief but are not recommended as a long-term solution. Spinal fusion surgery is generally reserved for cases where conservative measures have failed and there is significant instability or nerve root compression causing motor deficits or severe pain.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. She has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. On examination, she is found to have diffuse tenderness in the abdomen without any rebound or guarding. An incidental finding on her abdominal CT scan shows an adrenal mass measuring 4 cm in diameter.

What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's incidental finding? 

A. Adrenal adenoma
B. Adrenal carcinoma
C. Pheochromocytoma
D. Metastatic cancer 
E. Adrenal myelolipoma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of an adrenal mass raises suspicion for malignancy, particularly if it is larger than 4 cm in size or demonstrates features such as irregular borders or heterogeneity on imaging studies. Adrenal carcinoma can present with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and weight loss, making it difficult to diagnose early.

Question
A 60-year-old man undergoes routine colonoscopy screening and is found to have a large polypoid lesion in his sigmoid colon that measures approximately 3 cm in diameter. Biopsy results show tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.

What is the next step in management? 

A. Repeat colonoscopy in one year 
B. Surgical resection of the lesion 
C. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) 
D. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) 
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Large polyps (>2cm) with high-grade dysplasia are at increased risk for malignant transformation and should be surgically removed to prevent progression to colorectal cancer.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a routine physical exam and mentions occasional headaches over the past few months that resolve with over-the-counter pain medication.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's jaundice? 

A. Hepatitis B
B. Autoimmune hepatitis
C. Wilson's disease
D. Alcoholic liver disease
E. Primary biliary cholangitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history of alcohol abuse along with laboratory findings consistent with liver damage suggests alcoholic liver disease as the most likely cause.

Question
A 2-month-old male infant presents to his pediatrician with complaints of poor feeding and lethargy for the past few days. His mother reports that he has been increasingly irritable and has not had a bowel movement in two days. On examination, he appears pale and jaundiced with hepatosplenomegaly noted on palpation. Laboratory investigations show elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and reticulocyte count.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Hemolytic anemia 
B. Physiological jaundice 
C. Breast milk jaundice 
D. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I 
E. Gilbert's syndrome 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia along with high LDH and reticulocyte count suggest hemolytic anemia as the underlying cause.

Question
A 6-week-old baby presents to the emergency department with complaints of poor feeding, lethargy, and yellowing of skin for the past few days. On examination, he appears jaundiced with hepatosplenomegaly noted on palpation. Laboratory investigations show elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin and liver enzymes.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Biliary atresia 
B. Physiological jaundice 
C. Breast milk jaundice 
D. Dubin-Johnson syndrome 
E. Rotor syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia along with elevated liver enzymes suggests biliary atresia as the underlying cause.

Question
A 29-year-old woman presents to the labour ward at 40+3 weeks gestation with regular contractions that have been occurring every 2-3 minutes for the past hour. She has had a previous caesarean section and is hoping for a vaginal birth this time around. On examination, her cervix is found to be posterior, long, closed and thick. The fetal head is not engaged in the pelvis yet. What would be the most appropriate management? 

A. Immediate induction of labour
B. Vaginal prostaglandin E2
C. Expectant management with close monitoring 
D. Foley catheter cervical ripening 
E. Cervical balloon catheter insertion

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In women with a history of previous caesarean section who are attempting vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC), cervical ripening can be performed using a foley catheter or prostaglandins to increase the chances of successful VBAC.

Question
A 25-year-old primigravida woman presents to the labour ward at 39+6 weeks gestation with ruptured membranes but no contractions as yet. On examination, she has a soft cervix which is effaced by about 80% but only dilated to 1 cm. The fetal heart rate on cardiotocography is reassuringly normal and there are no signs of infection or meconium staining noted on inspection of amniotic fluid colour or odour.
What would be an appropriate course of action? 

A. Induction of labour with oxytocin infusion
B. Expectant management for up to 24 hours from rupture of membranes 
C. Antibiotic prophylaxis followed by immediate delivery via emergency caesarean section
D. Amniotomy followed by augmentation with oxytocin infusion if required
E. Immediate delivery via instrumental vaginal delivery 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In women with ruptured membranes but no contractions, expectant management for up to 24 hours is appropriate as long as there are no signs of infection or fetal compromise. This allows time for spontaneous onset of labour and reduces the need for induction.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to the labour ward at 41+2 weeks gestation in established labour. She has had a previous vaginal birth and her current pregnancy has been uncomplicated so far. On examination, she is found to have a fully dilated cervix and the fetal head is at station +1. However, despite pushing efforts, the baby's head remains high and does not descend further into the pelvis.
What would be an appropriate course of action? 

A. Immediate instrumental vaginal delivery
B. Maternal oxytocin infusion 
C. Expectant management with close monitoring 
D. McRoberts manoeuvre followed by suprapubic pressure 
E. Emergency caesarean section

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In cases where there is difficulty in descent of the fetal head during second stage of labour, maneuvers such as McRoberts manoeuvre (hyperflexion of maternal hips) followed by suprapubic pressure can help facilitate delivery without resorting to operative interventions like instrumental vaginal delivery or emergency caesarean section.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a deep laceration on his left hand sustained while using a chainsaw. The wound is approximately 8cm in length and extends through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle layers. On examination, there is active bleeding from the wound site and loss of sensation in the distribution of the ulnar nerve.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?

A. Apply direct pressure to control bleeding
B. Administer intravenous antibiotics
C. Perform immediate surgical exploration and repair under general anaesthesia
D. Obtain an X-ray of the affected limb to rule out underlying bone injury
E. Refer for hyperbaric oxygen therapy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The first step in managing any laceration is controlling bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound site.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a non-healing ulcer on her right leg that has been present for several months. She reports no history of trauma or infection at the site but does have a past medical history significant for peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus type II. Physical examination reveals an irregularly shaped ulcer measuring 4 cm x 3 cm with surrounding erythema and induration.

Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's non-healing ulcer? 

A. Venous insufficiency 
B. Arterial insufficiency 
C. Diabetic neuropathy 
D. Infection 
E. Malignancy 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Non-healing ulcers are commonly seen in patients with arterial insufficiency due to poor blood flow leading to impaired healing.

Question
A 25-year-old male was involved in a motor vehicle accident resulting in multiple injuries including a large laceration on his forehead extending into his scalp which required suturing under local anaesthesia. On post-operative day 2, he complains of severe headache and dizziness. His vital signs are within normal limits but neurological examination reveals a decreased level of consciousness.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Repeat suturing to ensure proper wound closure 
B. Administer intravenous antibiotics 
C. Obtain a CT scan of the head without contrast 
D. Perform an emergent craniotomy 
E. Discharge home with pain medication 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest possible intracranial bleeding or swelling, so obtaining a CT scan of the head without contrast is necessary to evaluate for any underlying pathology that may require further intervention.

Question
A 25-year-old woman with a history of learning disability presents to the GP with her mother, who is concerned about her daughter's recent behaviour. The patient has been experiencing episodes of agitation and aggression towards her family members, which have resulted in physical altercations. She also reports hearing voices that tell her to harm herself or others. Her mother reports that the patient has always had difficulty with social interactions and communication but has never exhibited violent behaviour before.
Which one of the following conditions is most likely causing these symptoms? 

A. Schizophrenia
B. Bipolar disorder
C. Borderline personality disorder
D. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
E. Conduct disorder

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The symptoms described are consistent with schizophrenia, which can present with hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking and behaviour, as well as negative symptoms such as social withdrawal and flattened affect.

Question
A 16-year-old boy with Down syndrome attends his annual check-up at the paediatric clinic accompanied by his parents. He is generally healthy but has recently gained weight despite no change in his diet or activity level. His parents report that he often eats large portions of food quickly and seems unable to recognize when he is full.
Which one of the following interventions would be most appropriate? 

A. Prescribe metformin for weight loss 
B. Recommend a low-carbohydrate diet 
C. Refer him to a specialist eating disorders service 
D. Encourage regular exercise 
E. Provide education on portion control 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: People with Down syndrome may have an increased risk of obesity due to factors such as reduced physical activity levels and impaired satiety signalling leading to overeating; therefore providing education on portion control may be helpful in managing their weight.

Question
A 30-year-old man with moderate learning disability lives independently in supported accommodation provided by a local charity. He has a history of epilepsy and is prescribed carbamazepine to control his seizures. He presents to the GP with complaints of feeling tired all the time, difficulty concentrating, and forgetfulness.
Which one of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Serum vitamin B12 level 
B. Thyroid function tests
C. Blood glucose level 
D. Liver function tests 
E. Renal function tests

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The symptoms described are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency, which can occur in people taking anticonvulsant medications such as carbamazepine due to impaired absorption of the vitamin from food; therefore measuring serum vitamin B12 levels would be an appropriate investigation in this case.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents to her GP with a complaint of pain in her right calf after walking for about 100 metres. She states that the pain is relieved upon rest and does not occur at night. Her medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, there is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or arterial bruits. However, there is reduced hair growth on the lower leg and foot.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Spinal claudication
B. Critical limb ischaemia
C. Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome
D. Buerger's disease
E. Peripheral arterial disease

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient has symptoms suggestive of intermittent claudication due to vascular insufficiency; however, there are no signs of peripheral neuropathy or arterial bruits which would suggest PAD as a cause. Reduced hair growth on the lower leg and foot suggests popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES), where compression of the popliteal artery occurs during exercise leading to ischemia-induced pain.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of bilateral calf pain when he walks more than half a mile without stopping for rest. He reports that this has been happening for several months now but has become progressively worse over time despite regular exercise and weight loss attempts. His past medical history includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking for over 30 years.
On examination, both legs appear normal except for slightly reduced pulses bilaterally.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A) Refer urgently for angiography 
B) Prescribe cilostazol 
C) Initiate supervised exercise therapy 
D) Start anticoagulation therapy 
E) Order duplex ultrasound scan

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of PAD, which should be confirmed by a duplex ultrasound scan. This non-invasive test can provide information on the location and severity of arterial stenosis or occlusion.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset severe pain in his left leg after walking for only a few metres. He has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, there is no palpable pulse below the knee, and the foot appears dusky with absent sensation.
What is the most appropriate management? 

A) Thrombolysis 
B) Amputation above the knee 
C) Embolectomy 
D) High dose aspirin therapy 
E) Angiography and angioplasty

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute limb ischemia, which requires immediate intervention to prevent tissue necrosis and gangrene. In this case, amputation above the knee may be necessary if revascularization cannot be achieved quickly enough to save the limb.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a three-month history of progressive weakness in her right arm and leg. She also reports experiencing occasional tingling sensations in the affected limb. On examination, there is significant wasting of the muscles in the right hand and forearm, as well as reduced power (2/5) in all movements of the right arm and leg. Reflexes are brisk on the right side compared to the left, and there is an extensor plantar response on the right side. Sensation is intact throughout.
Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate at this stage? 

A. Electromyography (EMG)
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain
C. Nerve conduction studies
D. Serum creatinine kinase level
E. Spinal tap

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests upper motor neuron involvement affecting one half of the body, which could indicate a lesion in the contralateral hemisphere or ipsilateral corticospinal tract within the spinal cord or brainstem. An MRI scan of the brain would be able to identify any structural abnormalities that may be causing these symptoms.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to his GP with a six-month history of progressive muscle weakness starting from his lower limbs and gradually spreading upwards to involve his arms and neck muscles too. He has lost weight over this period but denies any other systemic symptoms such as fever or night sweats. On examination, he has marked proximal muscle weakness affecting both upper and lower limbs with preserved reflexes bilaterally.
Which of the following investigations should be performed first? 

A. Anti-Jo-1 antibodies
B. Creatine kinase levels
C. Electromyography (EMG)
D. Muscle biopsy
E. Thyroid function tests

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The pattern of muscle weakness described here is consistent with an inflammatory myopathy such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Thyroid function tests should be performed first to rule out a secondary cause of muscle weakness, such as hypothyroidism.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset right-sided weakness and slurred speech. He has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia but is otherwise well. On examination, he has significant right-sided hemiparesis affecting both upper and lower limbs, with reduced power (3/5) in all movements on that side. There is also mild dysarthria noted.
Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. CT angiogram
B. Echocardiography
C. Lumbar puncture
D. MRI brain
E. Serum electrolytes

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests a cerebrovascular accident (stroke), which can be confirmed by performing an MRI scan of the brain to identify any areas of infarction or haemorrhage.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a limp and severe pain in his left leg after falling from a ladder while working on his roof. On examination, there is swelling and tenderness over the distal femur, and he is unable to bear weight on the affected limb. X-rays show a displaced fracture of the distal femur. The orthopaedic team decides to perform an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery for this patient.

Which one of the following statements regarding ORIF surgery for distal femur fractures is true? 

A. It should be performed within 24 hours of injury.
B. It has a high risk of infection compared to conservative management.
C. It requires long-term immobilization post-surgery.
D. It can result in knee stiffness if not done correctly.
E. It has no significant impact on mobility or quality of life post-recovery.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: ORIF surgery for distal femur fractures carries a risk of knee stiffness if not done correctly due to scarring around the joint during healing.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a limp and pain in her right hip that has been gradually worsening over several months, making it difficult for her to walk more than short distances without stopping due to discomfort. She reports no history of trauma or falls but does have osteoporosis diagnosed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan two years ago.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Osteoarthritis
B. Rheumatoid arthritis
C. Trochanteric bursitis
D. Stress fracture
E. Hip fracture

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The gradual onset of hip pain, difficulty walking, and osteoporosis puts this patient at high risk for hip fracture.

Question
A 30-year-old male runner presents with a limp and pain in his left foot that has been worsening over several weeks. He reports no history of trauma or falls but does have a high-arched foot type. On examination, there is tenderness along the lateral border of the foot, and he experiences pain when standing on tiptoes.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Plantar fasciitis
B. Achilles tendonitis
C. Stress fracture of the fifth metatarsal
D. Peroneal tendonitis
E. Cuboid syndrome

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The location of tenderness along the lateral border of the foot and pain with tiptoeing are suggestive of cuboid syndrome, which can occur due to repetitive stress on this bone in individuals with high-arched feet.

Question
A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe pain in her left loin that radiates towards her groin. She has no significant past medical history and is not on any regular medication. On examination, she appears uncomfortable and writhing around in bed due to the pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. There is tenderness over the left renal angle, and percussion elicits costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows microscopic haematuria but no infection. Which of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. CT urogram
B. MRI abdomen
C. Ultrasound KUB
D. Renal angiography 
E. Retrograde pyelogram

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests acute flank pain possibly caused by an obstructive uropathy or renal colic secondary to urinary stones; therefore, imaging should be performed urgently to confirm diagnosis and guide management decisions. Although ultrasound KUB is often used as first-line investigation for suspected renal colic, it may miss small stones or other causes of obstruction such as tumours or strictures, making CT urogram more sensitive and specific in detecting these conditions.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents with a dull ache in his right loin that has been present for several months but has recently become worse despite taking paracetamol regularly. He denies any recent trauma or feverish illness but admits to occasional dysuria and frequency of micturition without haematuria or urgency symptoms.
On examination, there is mild tenderness over the right kidney area without palpable masses or organomegaly.
Which of the following investigations would be most useful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Serum creatinine level
B. Urine culture and sensitivity
C. Abdominal X-ray
D. Intravenous urogram
E. Cystoscopy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of chronic pyelonephritis or obstructive uropathy, which can be confirmed by imaging studies such as intravenous urogram (IVU) that assesses the anatomy and function of the urinary tract. Serum creatinine level may indicate renal impairment but does not provide information on the cause of loin pain. Urine culture and sensitivity are useful in diagnosing urinary tract infections but do not establish a diagnosis of chronic pyelonephritis or obstruction. Abdominal X-ray and cystoscopy are unlikely to reveal any significant findings.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with sudden onset severe right-sided flank pain radiating towards her groin associated with nausea and vomiting. She has no significant past medical history except for hypertension treated with lisinopril.
On examination, she appears distressed and writhing around due to the pain. Her vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension despite fluid resuscitation.
Urinalysis shows microscopic haematuria without infection.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Renal artery stenosis
B. Acute glomerulonephritis 
C. Renal vein thrombosis
D. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm 
E. Renal infarction

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The sudden onset of severe loin pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and haematuria suggests acute renal infarction secondary to embolism or thrombosis of a renal artery branch, leading to ischemia and subsequent necrosis of renal tissue causing release of inflammatory mediators resulting in systemic symptoms such as tachycardia and hypotension despite fluid resuscitation. Other causes such as ruptured AAA or RVT would present differently with other characteristic symptoms and signs.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms along with laboratory findings suggest chronic kidney disease as the most likely cause of his presentation.

Question
A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of painless loss of vision in his right eye that started a few hours ago. He reports seeing flashes and floaters before the vision loss occurred. His medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, visual acuity is reduced to counting fingers in the affected eye. The red reflex is absent on fundoscopy, and there are multiple cotton wool spots seen throughout the retina.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Central retinal artery occlusion
B. Branch retinal vein occlusion
C. Vitreous hemorrhage
D. Retinal detachment
E. Diabetic retinopathy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with diabetic retinopathy, which can cause sudden onset painless vision loss due to bleeding or ischemia affecting the macula or optic nerve head respectively. Cotton wool spots represent areas of infarction within the retina caused by microvascular disease associated with diabetes mellitus.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her optometrist complaining of blurry vision in both eyes that has been gradually worsening over several months despite wearing corrective lenses for myopia (-4 diopters). She denies any other symptoms such as flashes or floaters but does report occasional headaches that she attributes to stress at work. Her past medical history is unremarkable except for mild asthma controlled with an inhaler as needed.

On examination, visual acuity is correctable to 6/9 in each eye with no relative afferent pupillary defect noted on swinging flashlight test bilaterally; however, there is a subtle decrease in brightness of the red reflex compared to what would be expected given her age and refractive error.

Which of the following conditions should be considered as part of this patient's differential diagnosis? 

A. Cataracts
B. Glaucoma
C. Retinitis pigmentosa
D. Macular degeneration
E. Optic neuritis

Correct Answer: A

Question
A 72-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of difficulty seeing clearly out of his left eye that has been worsening over several months despite using artificial tears for dry eyes as recommended by his optometrist. He reports no other ocular or systemic symptoms but does have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring home oxygen therapy.

On examination, visual acuity is reduced to 6/24 in the affected eye compared to 6/9 in the right eye; there is no relative afferent pupillary defect noted on swinging flashlight test bilaterally, but there is an obvious decrease in brightness of the red reflex seen only in the left eye.

Which of the following conditions should be considered as part of this patient's differential diagnosis? 

A. Age-related macular degeneration
B. Central serous chorioretinopathy 
C. Epiretinal membrane 
D. Vitreomacular traction syndrome 
E. Posterior vitreous detachment

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which can cause gradual onset central vision loss and decreased brightness of the red reflex on fundoscopy due to drusen accumulation or neovascularization affecting the macula region of the retina.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the GP with a complaint of loss of smell for the past 6 months. She reports that she has not been able to smell anything, including strong odours like perfume and cooking smells. She denies any history of nasal congestion or allergies. On examination, there is no evidence of nasal polyps or inflammation.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Anosmia due to viral infection
B. Anosmia due to head trauma
C. Anosmia due to allergic rhinitis
D. Anosmia due to Parkinson's disease
E. Idiopathic anosmia

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest idiopathic anosmia, which refers to a loss of sense of smell without an identifiable cause. It can be caused by damage or degeneration of olfactory receptor neurons in the nose, but often the cause is unknown.

Question
A 62-year-old man comes to see you with a complaint of sudden onset loss of smell after being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection 3 weeks ago. He reports that he had mild respiratory symptoms at the time but has since recovered from those symptoms.

What is the best initial management option for this patient?

A. Prescribe oral corticosteroids
B. Refer for urgent MRI scan
C. Recommend regular saline nasal irrigation
D. Advise on lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking and avoiding alcohol consumption
E. Reassure and monitor for spontaneous recovery

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Loss of smell (anosmia) is a common symptom associated with COVID-19 infection and typically resolves spontaneously within a few weeks to months without specific treatment.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents with complaints of recurrent episodes where she experiences complete loss of her sense of smell along with severe headache and dizziness lasting up to several hours before resolving spontaneously over the next few days. She reports that these episodes have been occurring intermittently for the past 6 months.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
B. Migraine with aura
C. Temporal lobe epilepsy
D. Multiple sclerosis
E. Nasal polyps

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of migraine with aura, which can present with transient loss of smell along with other neurological symptoms such as headache and dizziness. Further evaluation may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of recurrent anosmia.

Question
A 65-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a history of syncope and dizziness. She has been experiencing these symptoms for the past few days, along with nausea and vomiting. Her blood pressure is measured in both supine and standing positions.

Supine blood pressure: 110/70 mmHg
Standing blood pressure: 80/50 mmHg

Which of the following conditions could be responsible for her presentation? Provide a detailed explanation of the pathophysiology involved.

A. Addison's disease
B. Pheochromocytoma
C. Multiple system atrophy
D. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy
E. Hypovolemic shock

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of orthostatic hypotension, which can occur due to various causes such as dehydration, medication side effects, or autonomic dysfunction. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system and can lead to orthostatic hypotension as well as other symptoms such as Parkinsonism and cerebellar ataxia. MSA is caused by abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in certain areas of the brain, leading to degeneration of neurons involved in autonomic regulation.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents to his GP complaining of fatigue and lightheadedness on standing up from a seated position. He reports no significant medical history but mentions that he has been trying to lose weight recently through dieting and exercise. On examination, his blood pressure is measured in both supine and standing positions.

Supine blood pressure: 120/80 mmHg
Standing blood pressure: 90/60 mmHg

Which of the following dietary factors could contribute to his low blood pressure? Provide an explanation for how this factor affects blood pressure regulation.

A. High salt intake
B. Low potassium intake
C. Excessive caffeine consumption
D. Vitamin D deficiency
E. Iron overload

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Low potassium intake can lead to hypokalemia, which is a known cause of low blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension. Potassium plays an important role in regulating fluid balance and maintaining the resting membrane potential of cells, including those involved in vascular tone regulation. A deficiency in potassium can impair the ability of smooth muscle cells to contract properly, leading to vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of dizziness and weakness for the past few weeks. She has a history of hypertension that is well-controlled with medication, but reports skipping some doses recently due to forgetfulness. On examination, her blood pressure is measured in both supine and standing positions.

Supine blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg
Standing blood pressure: 100/60 mmHg

Which of the following medications could be responsible for her presentation? Provide an explanation for how this medication affects blood pressure regulation.

A. Beta-blocker
B. Calcium channel blocker
C. ACE inhibitor
D. Diuretic
E. Alpha-2 agonist

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Diuretics are commonly used as antihypertensive agents due to their ability to reduce plasma volume and cardiac output, thereby lowering blood pressure. However, excessive diuresis or dehydration can lead to hypovolemia and orthostatic hypotension, especially in elderly patients or those with pre-existing autonomic dysfunction. In this case, the patient's symptoms may be related to missed doses of her diuretic medication leading to volume depletion and subsequent low blood pressure on standing up from a seated position.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a history of recurrent depressive episodes over the past 10 years. She reports that she has tried various antidepressants in the past, but none have been effective for her symptoms. She also reports feeling anxious and irritable most days, which is affecting her work and relationships. On examination, she appears tearful and agitated, with psychomotor retardation. Her mood is low, and she expresses feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Her score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) is 28, indicating severe depression.
What would be the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Trial of an atypical antipsychotic
B. Referral for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
C. Combination treatment with lithium and an SSRI antidepressant
D. Referral for psychotherapy such as interpersonal therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy
E. Trial of a tricyclic antidepressant

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's severe depression, poor response to previous treatments, and psychomotor retardation suggest that ECT may be the most appropriate next step in management.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of low mood, loss of interest in activities he previously enjoyed, decreased energy levels, difficulty sleeping and concentrating over the last six months since his girlfriend broke up with him. He denies any suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts but admits to occasional alcohol use to help him sleep better at night.
On examination, he appears sad but cooperative; his affect is blunted; there are no abnormal movements noted.
Which one of these interventions should be considered first-line? 

A. Antidepressant medication 
B. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) 
C. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) 
D. Exercise prescription 
E. Supportive psychotherapy 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest mild to moderate depression. Exercise prescription is a first-line intervention for mild to moderate depression, and it has been shown to be as effective as antidepressant medication or CBT.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with complaints of low mood, decreased energy levels, difficulty sleeping and concentrating over the last six months since he retired from his job. He denies any suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts but admits to feeling hopeless about his future.
On examination, he appears sad; his affect is blunted; there are no abnormal movements noted.
Which one of these interventions should be considered? 

A. Antidepressant medication 
B. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) 
C. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) 
D. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
E. Referral for neuropsychological testing

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's age and history suggest that cognitive changes may be contributing to his depressive symptoms. Neuropsychological testing can help identify any underlying cognitive deficits and guide appropriate treatment options such as cognitive rehabilitation or pharmacotherapy targeting cognitive dysfunction in addition to treating depression.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with a lump in the right groin that has been gradually increasing in size over the past year. He reports no pain or discomfort associated with the lump, and there is no history of trauma or injury to the area. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the right inguinal region that measures approximately 5 cm in diameter. The mass is non-tender, firm, and fixed to underlying structures. There are no signs of inflammation or infection.

Which of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate for further evaluation of this patient's condition? 

A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
B. Computed tomography (CT) scan 
C. Ultrasonography 
D. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
E. X-ray

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Ultrasonography is typically used as an initial diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with suspected groin masses due to its high sensitivity and specificity for detecting hernias and other soft tissue abnormalities.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with a painful lump in her left groin that she noticed while lifting heavy boxes at work two days ago. She reports feeling feverish and experiencing nausea since then but denies any vomiting or changes in bowel habits. On examination, there is a tender, erythematous swelling located below the inguinal ligament on the left side that measures approximately 3 cm in diameter.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Inguinal hernia 
B. Femoral hernia 
C. Abscess 
D. Lymphadenitis 
E. Lipoma

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presence of pain, tenderness, redness, and warmth suggests an inflammatory process such as abscess formation rather than a benign mass like a lipoma or lymph node enlargement.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with a large, irreducible lump in his right groin that he has had for several months. He reports no pain or discomfort associated with the mass but is concerned about its size and appearance. On examination, there is a palpable swelling located medial to the pubic tubercle on the right side that measures approximately 8 cm in diameter. The mass is firm, non-tender, and fixed to underlying structures.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Inguinal hernia 
B. Femoral hernia 
C. Lipoma 
D. Sarcoma 
E. Metastatic lymph node

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of an enlarging, firm, and fixed mass in the groin region raises concern for malignancy such as sarcoma rather than a benign condition like a hernia or lipoma. Further imaging studies and biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate management options.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to his GP with a history of fever, night sweats and weight loss for the past six months. On examination, he has multiple enlarged lymph nodes in his neck, axillae and groins. He also has hepatosplenomegaly on palpation. Blood tests reveal an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). A biopsy of one of the lymph nodes shows granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Tuberculosis
B. Sarcoidosis
C. Lymphoma
D. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease
E. Castleman's disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests a systemic illness that could be infectious or non-infectious in origin. However, the presence of granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis on histological examination makes tuberculosis less likely as it usually shows caseating necrosis. Sarcoidosis is characterized by non-caseating granulomas affecting various organs including lungs, skin, eyes and lymph nodes.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents to her GP with a painless swelling in her left breast for two weeks duration which she noticed while performing self-examination at home. She denies any nipple discharge or skin changes overlying the lump but reports occasional mild fever and fatigue for the past few days.
On examination, there is a single firm mobile mass measuring approximately 3cm x 2cm in size located at 11 o'clock position in her left breast with no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy.
Which one of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Mammogram 
B. Ultrasound scan 
C. Fine needle aspiration cytology 
D. Core biopsy 
E. Excision biopsy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of a single palpable breast lump in a young female with no other significant history or clinical findings raises the suspicion of a benign lesion such as fibroadenoma. However, given her recent onset systemic symptoms and absence of axillary lymphadenopathy, malignancy cannot be ruled out completely. Core biopsy is the most appropriate investigation to establish the nature of the mass.

Question
A 50-year-old male presents to his GP with multiple enlarged lymph nodes in his neck for the past six months. He denies any fever, night sweats or weight loss but reports occasional fatigue and mild cough for which he has been taking over-the-counter medications. On examination, there are multiple firm mobile cervical lymph nodes measuring up to 3cm x 2cm in size without any tenderness or erythema.
Blood tests reveal an elevated serum calcium level and alkaline phosphatase level. Chest X-ray shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Sarcoidosis
B. Tuberculosis 
C. Lymphoma 
D. Metastatic carcinoma 
E. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this patient suggests a chronic illness that could be infectious or non-infectious in origin affecting both respiratory and lymphatic systems. However, the presence of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray along with hypercalcemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels makes sarcoidosis more likely than tuberculosis or lymphoma which can also cause similar presentations but do not typically show these laboratory abnormalities.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease presents to the emergency department after experiencing sudden onset abdominal pain and vomiting. On examination, he is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg, tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 bpm, and has cool extremities. Blood tests reveal a haemoglobin level of 70 g/L (normal range: Male - 135-180 g/L; Female - 115-160 g/L), platelet count of 60 x109/L (normal range: 150-400 x109/L) and an INR of 2.5 (normal range: <1). An urgent CT scan shows active extravasation from the left renal artery.

What is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient? 

A. Urgent nephrectomy
B. Endovascular embolisation
C. Massive transfusion protocol
D. Intravenous fluid resuscitation only 
E. Observation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with massive haemorrhage due to ruptured renal artery aneurysm or injury to the renal vasculature secondary to trauma or other underlying pathology such as malignancy or infection. Endovascular embolisation is the first-line treatment option for patients who are haemodynamically unstable as it allows rapid control of bleeding while avoiding major surgery which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the labour ward at term gestation in established labour having had no antenatal care throughout her pregnancy. She reports heavy vaginal bleeding since her waters broke earlier that day, but denies any abdominal pain or contractions until recently when she started experiencing severe cramping pains radiating to her back.

On examination, she appears pale and clammy, with a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination reveals a tender uterus consistent with contractions, and there is fresh vaginal bleeding.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's massive haemorrhage? 

A. Placenta praevia
B. Uterine rupture
C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
D. Abruptio placentae 
E. Cervical incompetence

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of abruptio placentae which is characterised by premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery resulting in significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognised and managed. It can present as vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain or tenderness, uterine hypertonicity, fetal distress or demise, DIC and/or shock.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department after sustaining multiple stab wounds to his chest during an altercation at a local bar. On arrival he has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8/15, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg, tachycardic with a heart rate of 130 bpm, and saturations on room air are 88%.

Question
A 50-year-old man with a history of alcohol dependence presents to his GP surgery requesting treatment for liver disease. He has been experiencing jaundice, abdominal pain, and fatigue for several weeks but refuses hospital admission or referral to specialist services. The patient appears lucid and able to communicate clearly but smells strongly of alcohol.
What factors should be considered when assessing this patient's capacity? What legal framework would apply if he was found to lack capacity? 

A. Age
B. Diagnosis
C. Substance use disorder
D. Ability to understand information relevant to decision-making 
E. Human Rights Act

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: When assessing capacity, it is important to consider whether the individual has an impairment or disturbance in their mind or brain which affects their ability to make decisions about their health and well-being. In this scenario, although the patient has a history of alcohol dependence, this alone does not necessarily mean that he lacks capacity - his current ability to understand information relevant to his decision-making should be assessed before any conclusions are drawn regarding his mental capacity.
If he was found to lack capacity, then an assessment under the Mental Capacity Act would be appropriate before making any decisions on his behalf in relation to his medical care and treatment options.

A definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating acid-fast bacilli in sputum or tissue samples from affected organs using Ziehl-Neelsen staining or culture techniques. However, in this case, bronchoscopy with biopsy is more appropriate given the presence of pulmonary nodules and hemoptysis.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of night sweats, fever, and malaise over the past year despite completing several courses of antibiotics prescribed by her GP for suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs). She also complains of abdominal pain and bloating that worsens after eating certain foods.

On examination, she has mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen but no palpable masses or organomegaly.

What is the most likely underlying cause? 

A. Crohn's disease
B. Diverticulitis
C. Endometriosis
D. Ovarian cancer 
E. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of endometriosis involving the bowel which can mimic other conditions such as UTIs, diverticulitis or ovarian cancer. The diagnosis can be confirmed by laparoscopy with biopsy of the affected tissue.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a history of night sweats, fever, and weight loss over the past month. He also reports coughing up blood and shortness of breath for the past week.

On examination, he is tachypneic with decreased breath sounds on the right side of his chest. His chest X-ray shows a large cavitating lesion in the right upper lobe.

Which one of the following investigations would be most useful to confirm the diagnosis? 

A. Sputum culture
B. Bronchoscopy with biopsy
C. CT-guided lung biopsy
D. PET scan 
E. Bone marrow biopsy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by cavitation which increases the likelihood of transmission and poor treatment outcomes if not detected early. A definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating acid-fast bacilli in sputum or tissue samples from affected organs using Ziehl-Neelsen staining or culture techniques. However, in this case, bronchoscopy with biopsy is more appropriate given the presence of a large cavitating lesion and respiratory symptoms suggestive of airway involvement.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of bilateral nipple discharge that is yellowish in color and occurs spontaneously without any manipulation or pressure on the breasts. She has no significant past medical history, but her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 50. On examination, there are no palpable masses or lymphadenopathy, but both nipples show multiple ductal openings from which the discharge can be expressed. Mammography and breast ultrasound are normal.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Intraductal papilloma
B. Breast abscess
C. Duct ectasia
D. Paget’s disease of the nipple
E. Mammary duct fistula

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with mammary duct fistula, which is a rare condition characterized by an abnormal communication between a lactiferous duct and the skin surface of the nipple or areola. It typically presents as spontaneous unilateral or bilateral nipple discharge that may be bloody, serous, or purulent in nature and can occur intermittently or continuously over several months to years. The diagnosis is usually made based on clinical features and imaging studies such as mammography, breast ultrasound, or MRI.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of left-sided nipple discharge that is milky in color and occurs only when he squeezes his nipple firmly. He denies any other symptoms such as pain, swelling, or fever, but reports feeling anxious about this new symptom because he has never experienced it before. He has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medication except for occasional ibuprofen for headaches.
What is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Referral to breast clinic for urgent assessment
B. Prescribe antibiotics empirically for mastitis 
C. Order prolactin level measurement 
D. Perform breast ultrasound 
E. Advise observation and follow-up in 2-4 weeks 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of galactorrhea, which is defined as the spontaneous flow of milk from the breast unrelated to pregnancy or lactation. Galactorrhea can be caused by a variety of factors including medications (e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants), pituitary adenomas, hypothyroidism, or idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, the most appropriate initial management would be to order serum prolactin level measurement to rule out hyperprolactinemia as the underlying cause.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a 1-month history of right-sided nipple discharge that is bloody in color and occurs spontaneously without any manipulation or pressure on the breast. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of breast cancer in her mother and sister. On examination, there is no palpable mass or lymphadenopathy, but there is an area of skin thickening and erythema around the right nipple.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Intraductal papilloma
B. Breast abscess
C. Duct ectasia
D. Paget’s disease of the nipple
E. Invasive ductal carcinoma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are highly suspicious for Paget's disease of the nipple, which is a rare form of breast cancer that typically presents with eczematous changes involving the nipple and areola such as itching, burning, crusting, oozing, or bleeding along with associated nipple discharge that may be serous or bloody in nature. It usually arises from an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma located within 3 cm of the nipple-areolar complex. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a biopsy of the affected area to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of disease.

Question
A 29-year-old woman presents for her first antenatal visit at 12 weeks’ gestation. She has a history of recurrent miscarriages and is anxious about the outcome of this pregnancy.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: ICP is characterized by pruritus, usually on the palms and soles, without a rash. It is associated with elevated serum bile acids and liver function tests.

Question
A 37-year-old woman presents to her obstetrician at 36 weeks’ gestation complaining of reduced fetal movements over the past two days. She reports that she has not felt any significant movement since yesterday afternoon, despite trying all the usual methods to stimulate fetal activity.
On examination, there are no other significant findings noted apart from a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern on cardiotocography (CTG).
What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Immediate induction of labour
B. Urgent referral for an emergency caesarean section 
C. Observation in hospital with daily CTG monitoring until delivery
D. Administration of steroids for fetal lung maturity followed by elective caesarean section 
E. Fetal blood sampling for acid-base status

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Reduced fetal movements can be a sign of fetal compromise and requires further investigation including CTG monitoring and ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and wellbeing. If there are signs of fetal distress or hypoxia, immediate delivery may be necessary but otherwise observation in hospital with daily CTG monitoring until delivery is appropriate.

A 45-year-old woman presents to the gynaecology clinic with a history of pelvic pain and discomfort for the past six months. She has noticed an increase in her abdominal size and weight gain during this time. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the pelvis that is non-tender and immobile. An ultrasound scan shows a large complex cystic lesion measuring 10 cm x 12 cm on the left ovary.

What is the most appropriate management option for this patient?

A. Laparotomy
B. Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy
C. Ovarian cystectomy
D. Watchful waiting with repeat imaging
E. Chemotherapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of a large complex ovarian mass requires surgical intervention to rule out malignancy or torsion. Laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy is preferred over laparotomy as it offers quicker recovery times, less postoperative pain, and fewer complications.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain and distension for two days associated with nausea and vomiting but no vaginal bleeding or discharge. Her last menstrual period was five years ago, and she has never had any gynaecological surgery before.

On examination, there is diffuse tenderness in the lower abdomen, which is more pronounced on deep palpation around the suprapubic region. There is also rebound tenderness present.

Which of the following investigations should be performed first? 

A) CT scan of abdomen and pelvis 
B) Transvaginal ultrasound 
C) Serum CA-125 levels 
D) Urine pregnancy test 
E) MRI of pelvis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In women presenting with acute onset lower abdominal pain, it's important to rule out ectopic pregnancy as it can cause life-threatening complications if left untreated. A urine pregnancy test is a quick and inexpensive way to confirm or exclude the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy.

Question
A 40-year-old woman presents with a history of irregular periods, pelvic pain, and bloating for six months. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of ovarian cancer in her mother. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the pelvis that is non-tender and mobile.

Which of the following investigations should be performed first? 

A) CA-125 levels 
B) Transvaginal ultrasound 
C) MRI of pelvis 
D) CT scan of abdomen and pelvis 
E) PET scan

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In women presenting with symptoms suggestive of ovarian cancer, transvaginal ultrasound is the initial investigation of choice as it can provide information about the size, location, and characteristics of any masses present in the ovaries. CA-125 levels may also be elevated in ovarian cancer but are not specific enough to make a definitive diagnosis on their own.

Question
A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department with bilateral ankle swelling that has been worsening over the past month. He reports a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient denies any chest pain or shortness of breath but reports feeling more fatigued than usual. Physical examination reveals pitting oedema up to the mid-thigh bilaterally, as well as jugular venous distension and bibasal crackles on lung auscultation. Blood tests reveal elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and low serum albumin levels.
Which of the following is most likely responsible for this presentation? 

A. Idiopathic membranous nephropathy
B. Acute interstitial nephritis
C. Hepatic cirrhosis 
D. Right-sided heart failure 
E. Lymphoma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with right-sided heart failure, which can lead to peripheral oedema due to increased systemic venous pressure causing fluid accumulation in dependent areas such as the ankles and legs. Jugular venous distension and bibasal crackles are also indicative of right ventricular dysfunction leading to backflow into the lungs resulting in pulmonary congestion and oedema formation. Elevated BNP levels indicate cardiac stress while low serum albumin levels suggest hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure.

Question
A 50-year-old female presents with unilateral ankle swelling that has been present for several weeks without improvement despite conservative management measures such as leg elevation and compression stockings use. She reports no significant medical history apart from being overweight with a BMI of 32 kg/m²; she takes no regular medications nor does she smoke or drink alcohol excessively.
On physical examination, there is non-pitting oedema of her left foot extending up to the mid-calf, with erythema and tenderness over the medial malleolus. There is no palpable cord or Homan's sign. 
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cellulitis
B. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
C. Lymphoedema
D. Rheumatoid arthritis 
E. Osteomyelitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation is concerning for DVT, which can present as unilateral ankle swelling that may be accompanied by erythema and tenderness over the affected area. Non-pitting oedema suggests a more solid form of swelling such as that seen in DVT rather than fluid accumulation seen in lymphoedema or heart failure-related peripheral oedema. The absence of palpable cords or Homan's sign does not rule out DVT but it should prompt further investigation with imaging studies.

Question
A 70-year-old male presents to his GP complaining of bilateral ankle swelling that has been worsening over several months despite taking furosemide daily prescribed by his cardiologist for congestive heart failure (CHF). He reports shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue, but denies chest pain or orthopnoea.
On examination, there is pitting oedema up to the mid-thigh bilaterally, jugular venous distension, and bibasal crackles on lung auscultation.
What is the next best step in management? 

A. Increase dose of furosemide
B. Initiate spironolactone therapy
C. Order an echocardiogram 
D. Refer for cardiac catheterization 
E. Start anticoagulation therapy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with CHF exacerbation despite being treated with diuretics such as furosemide. An echocardiogram is the next best step in management to assess for any structural abnormalities or worsening of cardiac function that may require further intervention such as cardiac catheterization or initiation of spironolactone therapy. Anticoagulation therapy is not indicated in this case since there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of thromboembolic disease.

Question
A 45-year-old female patient presents to her primary care physician with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and dry cough for two weeks duration along with mild chest discomfort that worsens during deep breathing or coughing episodes. She has no significant medical history but has been experiencing weight loss recently despite having a good appetite. Physical examination reveals reduced breath sounds at the left base of her lungs along with dullness to percussion in this area suggestive of a possible pleural effusion.

What would be the most appropriate diagnostic test? 

A) CT scan thorax
B) MRI thorax
C) PET-CT scan
D) Bronchoscopy
E) Pleural biopsy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In patients suspected to have malignant pleural effusions based on clinical features like unexplained weight loss or smoking history; imaging studies may not always provide conclusive evidence for the diagnosis. In such cases, pleural biopsy is considered as the gold standard for establishing a definitive diagnosis.

Question
A 55-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset shortness of breath and chest pain that worsens on deep inspiration. On examination, there are decreased breath sounds over the left lung field along with dullness to percussion suggestive of a possible pleural effusion. Chest x-ray confirms the presence of a moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion.

Which of the following findings would suggest an underlying malignancy? 

A) Pleural fluid pH <7.2
B) Pleural fluid glucose >60mg/dL
C) Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio >0.5
D) Presence of malignant cells in pleural fluid cytology 
E) Elevated serum CA-125 levels

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of malignant cells in pleural fluid cytology is highly indicative of an underlying malignancy causing the pleural effusion. Other features like low pH, high glucose or high protein/serum protein ratios may be seen in various other causes including infections and autoimmune disorders but are not specific for malignancy. Serum CA-125 levels may be elevated in ovarian cancer but have limited utility in diagnosing other types of malignancies associated with pleural effusions.

Question
A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with symptoms of acute poisoning after ingesting an unknown substance. He appears agitated and confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10/15. His blood pressure is elevated at 160/90 mmHg, heart rate is 110/min and respiratory rate is 22/min. On examination, he has dilated pupils that are unresponsive to light, dry mucous membranes, and hyperactive bowel sounds.

Which of the following substances could cause these symptoms? 

A. Organophosphate insecticides
B. Benzodiazepines
C. Opioids 
D. Carbon monoxide 
E. Cyanide

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vomiting after consuming mushrooms she picked from her garden earlier that day for dinner with her family. She reports feeling dizzy and disoriented before losing consciousness on arrival at hospital.

On examination, she has a GCS score of 8/15 with pinpoint pupils that react sluggishly to light stimulation; hypotension (80/50 mmHg), bradycardia (45 bpm) and shallow breathing (respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute). Laboratory investigations reveal elevated liver enzymes suggestive of hepatotoxicity.

What is the most likely toxin responsible for this clinical presentation? 

A. Muscarine
B. Psilocybin
C. Ibotenic acid
D. Amanitin 
E. Coprine

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning which can lead to severe hepatotoxicity, acute liver failure and death. Amatoxins are heat-stable cyclic peptides that inhibit RNA polymerase II leading to impaired protein synthesis in hepatocytes.

Question
A 40-year-old man is brought into the emergency department with altered mental status after being found unconscious by his family at home. He has a history of chronic alcoholism and drug abuse but no known medical conditions.

On examination, he is unresponsive with a GCS score of 3/15, hypotension (80/50 mmHg), tachycardia (120 bpm) and shallow breathing (respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute). Pupils are dilated and non-reactive to light stimulation; skin is cool and clammy.

Which of the following substances could cause this clinical presentation? 

A. Ethanol
B. Methanol
C. Isopropyl alcohol
D. Cocaine 
E. Heroin

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests methanol toxicity which can occur through ingestion or inhalation of products containing methanol such as antifreeze, windshield washer fluid or solvents used in industry or photography. Symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, visual disturbances followed by metabolic acidosis due to accumulation of formic acid produced during metabolism of methanol by alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme in the liver leading to optic nerve damage, blindness and death if untreated promptly with ethanol or fomepizole as antidotes along with supportive care including hemodialysis if necessary for severe cases.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of excessive thirst and frequent urination for the past six months. She has no significant medical history, but she is currently taking medications for hypertension. Her blood test results are as follows:

Na+ 140 mmol/L (135 - 145)
K+ 4.0 mmol/L (3.5 - 5.0)
Urea 6.2 mmol/L (2.5 - 7.8)
Creatinine 70 µmol/L (44 - 80)
Glucose 5.8 mmol/L (4-6)

What is the most likely diagnosis? To confirm the diagnosis, which test should be performed? What would be the expected result? How can this condition be managed?

A) Diabetes insipidus
B) Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
C) Psychogenic polydipsia
D) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
E) Hypercalcaemia

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a possible diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which is caused by resistance to antidiuretic hormone in the kidneys resulting in an inability to concentrate urine leading to polyuria and polydipsia. The water deprivation test is used to diagnose this condition, where fluid intake is restricted while monitoring urine output and osmolality over several hours, followed by administration of desmopressin if necessary. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, urine osmolality remains low even after fluid restriction or desmopressin administration due to impaired response to ADH in the kidneys. Treatment involves addressing any underlying causes such as medication-induced or genetic mutations causing X-linked inheritance pattern.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with complaints of increased thirst and frequency of urination for the past year. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus that is poorly controlled despite taking oral hypoglycemic agents. His blood test results are as follows:

Na+ 142 mmol/L (135 - 145)
K+ 4.2 mmol/L (3.5 - 5.0)
Urea 6.8 mmol/L (2.5 - 7.8)
Creatinine 90 µmol/L (44 - 80)
Glucose 18 mmol/L (4-6)

What is the most likely diagnosis? What additional tests should be performed? How can this condition be managed? 

A) Diabetes insipidus
B) Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
C) Psychogenic polydipsia
D) Diabetic ketoacidosis
E) Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a possible diagnosis of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, which is a life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus characterized by severe dehydration, altered mental status, and high serum osmolality (>320 mOsm/kg). Additional tests such as arterial blood gas analysis, electrolyte panel, and imaging studies may be necessary to assess the extent of organ damage and complications associated with this condition such as cerebral edema or thrombosis. Management involves aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy to correct hyperglycemia gradually while monitoring electrolytes closely.

Question
A previously healthy 25-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of excessive thirst and frequent urination for the past month. She denies any significant medical history or medication use but reports recent weight loss despite increased appetite. Her blood test results are as follows:

Na+ 138 mmol/L (135 - 145)
K+ 3.8 mmol/L (3.5 - 5.0)
Urea 4.2 mmol/L (2.5 - 7.8)
Creatinine 60 µmol/L (44 - 80)
Glucose 12 mmol/L (4-6)

What is the most likely diagnosis? What additional tests should be performed? How can this condition be managed? 

A) Diabetes insipidus
B) Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
C) Psychogenic polydipsia
D) Diabetic ketoacidosis
E) Type 1 diabetes mellitus

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a possible diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia resulting in polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and fatigue. Additional tests such as HbA1c, C-peptide levels, and autoantibody testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any associated complications such as diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. Management involves insulin replacement therapy with close monitoring of blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise to prevent long-term complications associated with this condition.

Question
A 60-year-old woman underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic for her booking appointment at 12 weeks gestation. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, both well-controlled on medication prior to pregnancy. Her HbA1c level is 7%, and she has no evidence of microvascular or macrovascular complications.

Which of the following interventions would be most effective in reducing this patient's risk of adverse perinatal outcomes? 

A. Tight glycaemic control during pregnancy 
B. Early delivery at 37 weeks gestation 
C. Low-dose aspirin therapy 
D. Increased frequency of antenatal appointments 
E. Strict blood pressure control throughout pregnancy 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Women with pre-existing diabetes are at increased risk for adverse perinatal outcomes such as macrosomia, stillbirth, and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Tight glycaemic control during pregnancy has been shown to reduce these risks.

Question
A 27-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic for her first appointment at 10 weeks gestation. She has a history of epilepsy and is currently taking lamotrigine monotherapy with good seizure control. Her most recent serum level of lamotrigine is within the therapeutic range.

Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate in managing this patient's risk of teratogenicity? 

A. Switching to carbamazepine 
B. Increasing dose of lamotrigine 
C. Adding folic acid supplementation 
D. Offering prenatal genetic testing 
E. Continuing current medication regimen 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Lamotrigine is considered a relatively safe antiepileptic drug in pregnancy, with a low risk of major congenital malformations compared to other antiepileptic drugs. The patient should continue her current medication regimen unless there are specific concerns about its safety or efficacy in pregnancy.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with premature labour at 32 weeks gestation. She has a history of preterm delivery in her previous pregnancy and is currently experiencing regular contractions every 5 minutes. On examination, her cervix is found to be dilated to 3 cm with bulging membranes. The fetal heart rate is within normal limits.

What would be the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Administer intravenous magnesium sulfate
B. Administer betamethasone
C. Perform an emergency caesarean section
D. Administer oxytocin infusion 
E. Observe and monitor

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Betamethasone is indicated for women who are at risk of preterm delivery between 24-34 weeks gestation as it promotes fetal lung maturation and reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In this case, given that the patient is at high risk of preterm delivery due to her past medical history, administering betamethasone would be the most appropriate course of action.

Question
A neonate born at 30 weeks gestation develops apnoea and bradycardia on day three of life despite being on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support with supplemental oxygen therapy. Blood gas analysis reveals metabolic acidosis with increased lactate levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Patent ductus arteriosus
B. Necrotizing enterocolitis
C. Intraventricular haemorrhage
D. Sepsis 
E. Hypoglycaemia

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Preterm infants are at higher risk of developing sepsis due to their immature immune system and exposure to invasive procedures such as intubation and central line placement in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Apnoea and bradycardia are common clinical features of sepsis in neonates. Metabolic acidosis with increased lactate levels is also a hallmark feature of sepsis.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic at 28 weeks gestation with complaints of decreased fetal movements for the past two days. She has a history of preterm labour in her previous pregnancy which was managed conservatively.

On examination, the fetal heart rate is within normal limits but there is evidence of oligohydramnios on ultrasound scan.

What would be the most appropriate management? 

A. Administer intravenous magnesium sulfate
B. Perform an emergency caesarean section
C. Prescribe oral nifedipine 
D. Administer betamethasone 
E. Observe and monitor

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Oligohydramnios is associated with poor fetal outcomes including preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and stillbirths. In this case, given that the patient has a history of preterm labour and decreased fetal movements along with evidence of oligohydramnios, administering betamethasone would be the most appropriate course of action as it promotes fetal lung maturation and reduces the incidence of RDS in premature infants who are born before 34 weeks gestation.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of a bleeding disorder due to low platelet counts, which can be confirmed by measuring the platelet count on a complete blood count (CBC). Aspirin use can cause mild thrombocytopenia; however, other causes such as immune-mediated destruction or decreased production should also be considered depending on the CBC findings and further workup may be necessary to determine the underlying etiology of thrombocytopenia in this patient.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to the colorectal clinic with a history of rectal prolapse for several years. She reports that she has difficulty controlling her bowel movements and experiences fecal incontinence. On examination, there is evidence of full-thickness rectal prolapse on straining. The patient has tried conservative management with pelvic floor exercises and bulking agents but has had no improvement.

What is the most appropriate surgical intervention for this patient?

A. Abdominal approach with rectopexy
B. Perineal approach with Delorme's procedure
C. Transanal approach with STARR (Stapled Trans-Anal Rectal Resection)
D. Laparoscopic approach with resection rectopexy
E. Sacral nerve stimulation

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In patients who have failed conservative management, surgery may be indicated for symptomatic relief of rectal prolapse and associated symptoms such as fecal incontinence or obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS). Laparoscopic resection rectopexy is considered the gold standard treatment for full-thickness rectal prolapse due to its low recurrence rate and good functional outcomes.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his General Practitioner with a history of recurrent episodes of bright red bleeding per rectum over the past year, which he describes as "drips" after passing stools; however, he denies any pain or change in bowel habit.
On examination, there are no palpable masses or tenderness on abdominal examination. Digital rectal examination reveals an ulcerated lesion at the posterior midline of the anus measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Anal fissure 
B. Haemorrhoids 
C. Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome 
D. Rectocele 
E. Squamous cell carcinoma

Explanation: The clinical presentation is suggestive of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), which is a rare inflammatory skin condition characterized by painful, rapidly progressing ulcers with undermined borders. PG can occur as a primary disease or secondary to an underlying systemic disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or hematological malignancies. The diagnosis of PG is based on clinical features and histopathological examination showing neutrophilic infiltrates without evidence of infection.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with a large, painless lump on his back that has been present for several years. On examination, there is a firm, non-tender mass measuring approximately 15 cm in diameter with irregular borders and areas of ulceration. Imaging studies reveal extensive invasion into the surrounding tissues.

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Liposarcoma 
B. Fibrosarcoma 
C. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 
D. Rhabdomyosarcoma
E. Synovial sarcoma

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with liposarcoma, which is a malignant soft tissue tumor arising from adipose tissue. Liposarcomas typically present as slow-growing masses that may become quite large before causing symptoms due to compression of adjacent structures. They can invade surrounding tissues and have high rates of local recurrence even after complete surgical resection. Histologically, liposarcomas are classified into different subtypes based on their cellular morphology and genetic alterations.

Question
A 75-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with a non-healing ulcer on her left leg. She reports that the ulcer has been present for several months and is gradually increasing in size. On examination, there is a 5cm shallow ulcer with an irregular border and sloping edges located over the lateral aspect of the lower leg. The surrounding skin appears thin and shiny, and there are multiple dilated tortuous superficial veins on both legs. The patient denies any significant past medical history but takes aspirin daily for arthritis pain.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Squamous cell carcinoma
B. Basal cell carcinoma
C. Venous ulcer

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS)
B. Central Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (CSAS)
C. Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)
D. Narcolepsy
E. Insomnia Disorder

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests OSAS since it is characterized by loud snoring, witnessed apneas or hypopneas while sleeping, excessive daytime sleepiness, obesity with increased neck circumference, and gasping for air upon awakening.

Question
A 45-year-old female presents with complaints of difficulty falling asleep at night, waking up frequently during the night, and feeling unrefreshed in the morning despite getting adequate hours of sleep. She reports that she has been experiencing these symptoms for the past six months, which have significantly impacted her daily life. The patient also mentions that she feels anxious and worried about not being able to fall asleep or stay asleep.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management strategy? 

A. Prescribe a benzodiazepine
B. Prescribe a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic
C. Recommend cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
D. Order polysomnography (PSG)
E. Refer to a sleep specialist

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: CBT is considered first-line treatment for insomnia disorder as it addresses underlying psychological factors contributing to sleep difficulties without causing dependence or tolerance issues associated with pharmacological interventions.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the antenatal clinic for her routine check-up at 30 weeks gestation. She has a history of type 1 diabetes and hypertension, both well-controlled with medication. Her previous pregnancy resulted in a macrosomic baby weighing 4.5 kg delivered via caesarean section at term. On examination, her fundal height measures small for gestational age (SGA) and an ultrasound confirms fetal growth restriction with estimated fetal weight below the 10th centile. The Doppler study shows absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery.
What is the most likely cause of SGA in this patient? 

A. Maternal hypertension
B. Maternal smoking
C. Placental insufficiency 
D. Fetal chromosomal abnormality 
E. Maternal malnutrition

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In this case, placental insufficiency is the most likely cause of SGA as it is common in women with pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension which can lead to poor placentation resulting in reduced blood supply to the fetus.

Question
A newborn baby girl is born at 38 weeks gestation via normal vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Her birthweight is above the 90th centile for gestational age and sex, but she appears otherwise healthy on initial assessment by midwives and paediatricians present at delivery suite. However, two hours later, she becomes lethargic and hypoglycaemic with a blood glucose level of 2 mmol/L despite regular feeds since birth.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Large for gestational age (LGA)
B. Neonatal sepsis
C. Transient neonatal hyperinsulinism
D. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
E. Hypothyroidism

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Transient neonatal hyperinsulinism is the most likely diagnosis in this case as it commonly occurs in LGA babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes. The baby's high birth weight and hypoglycaemia are consistent with this condition.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents for her first antenatal visit at 12 weeks gestation. She has a history of bariatric surgery two years ago, which resulted in significant weight loss. Her pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 22 kg/m². An ultrasound scan confirms that she is carrying dichorionic diamniotic twins but one twin measures small for gestational age (SGA) while the other twin measures appropriately for gestational age.
What is the most likely cause of SGA? 

A. Maternal malnutrition
B. Congenital infection
C. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome 
D. Placental insufficiency 
E. Fetal chromosomal abnormality

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In this case, placental insufficiency is the most likely cause of SGA in one twin as bariatric surgery can lead to poor placentation resulting in reduced blood supply to one fetus leading to growth restriction while the other continues to grow normally due to adequate blood supply from its own placenta.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches and loud snoring. He has a BMI of 32 kg/m2 and reports that he wakes up frequently during the night feeling short of breath. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale score is 18/24. On examination, he has tonsillar hypertrophy, a Mallampati class III airway and a neck circumference of 42 cm. The GP suspects obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and refers him for an overnight polysomnography study.
Which one of the following is not a risk factor for OSA? 

A. Obesity
B. Tonsillar hypertrophy
C. Male gender
D. Smoking 
E. Hypothyroidism

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: While obesity, tonsillar hypertrophy, male gender and smoking are all established risk factors for OSA, hypothyroidism does not have a clear association with this condition.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of snoring, witnessed apnoeas and restless sleep over the past year. She has no significant medical history except for hypertension which is well-controlled on medication. Her physical examination is unremarkable except for mild obesity (BMI=30 kg/m2). The GP suspects OSA and orders an overnight home sleep study which confirms moderate-severe disease (apnoea-hypopnea index = 35/hour).
What would be the most appropriate initial treatment option? 

A. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
B. Mandibular advancement device (MAD)
C. Weight loss program
D. Nasal corticosteroids 
E. Oral appliances

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients with mild-to-moderate OSA who are overweight or obese, weight loss through lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes and increased physical activity is recommended as the first-line treatment. CPAP and MADs are reserved for patients with more severe disease or who do not respond to weight loss measures.

Question
A 5-year-old boy presents to his paediatrician with complaints of snoring, restless sleep and daytime fatigue over the past few months. He has no significant medical history except for recurrent tonsillitis which required multiple courses of antibiotics in the past year. On examination, he has enlarged tonsils (grade III) and a normal BMI for age.
What would be the most appropriate management? 

A. Observation
B. Tonsillectomy 
C. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
D. Intranasal corticosteroids 
E. Weight loss program

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Enlarged tonsils are a common cause of snoring and OSA in children, especially those with recurrent tonsillitis. Tonsillectomy is considered the definitive treatment in these cases, with resolution of symptoms reported in up to 80% of cases following surgery. Observation may be appropriate in mild cases or when surgical risks outweigh benefits, but should be avoided if there is evidence of significant disease or associated complications such as growth failure or behavioural problems.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the Emergency Department with a history of sudden onset severe pain in his right shoulder while lifting weights at the gym. He reports no previous history of similar symptoms or trauma to the area. On examination, there is tenderness over the anterior aspect of the shoulder and weakness on abduction and external rotation. The patient's X-ray shows no bony abnormalities. MRI reveals a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon.
Which of the following is true regarding this condition? 

A. Conservative management with physiotherapy alone is sufficient for complete recovery
B. Surgical intervention should be considered only if conservative treatment fails
C. Arthroscopic repair has higher complication rates compared to open surgery
D. Early surgical intervention within 6 weeks of injury results in better outcomes than delayed surgery
E. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated in this condition

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Early surgical intervention within 6 weeks of injury results in better outcomes than delayed surgery.

Question
A 50-year-old female presents with a complaint of chronic lower back pain that radiates down her left leg to her foot, which has been present for several months now and has not responded to conservative measures such as physical therapy and analgesics. She also reports numbness and tingling sensation along her left leg and foot, especially when sitting or standing for prolonged periods.
On examination, there is tenderness over the lumbar spine, positive straight-leg raise test on the left side, decreased reflexes on the same side, and muscle weakness in dorsiflexion.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Lumbar disc herniation 
B. Spinal stenosis 
C. Spondylolisthesis 
D. Osteoporotic vertebral fracture 
E. Ankylosing spondylitis 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Lumbar disc herniation is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents to the clinic with a history of recurrent episodes of swelling, pain, and stiffness in his right knee for several years now. He reports no previous trauma or injury to the area. On examination, there is tenderness over the medial aspect of the knee joint, effusion, crepitus on movement, and limited range of motion.
X-ray shows narrowing of the joint space and osteophyte formation along with subchondral sclerosis.
Which of the following is true regarding this condition? 

A. It is more common in females than males
B. The first line treatment includes intra-articular corticosteroid injections 
C. Surgical intervention should be considered only if conservative measures fail
D. Weight-bearing exercises are recommended as part of rehabilitation 
E. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated in this condition

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Surgical intervention should be considered only if conservative measures fail in cases of knee osteoarthritis.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents with a history of chronic pain and fatigue for the past 5 years. She has been to multiple doctors and undergone numerous investigations, but no organic cause has been found. On examination, she appears anxious and reports tenderness in multiple areas of her body when touched. She also complains of headaches, dizziness, and difficulty sleeping. Which one of the following is most likely to be beneficial in managing this patient?

A. Opioid analgesics
B. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
C. Physiotherapy
D. Antidepressants
E. Antibiotics

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation is suggestive of somatisation disorder or fibromyalgia, which are often associated with depression and anxiety disorders. Therefore, antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may be helpful in managing these patients.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of chest pain that have been investigated extensively over the past year without any organic cause being identified. He describes the pain as sharp and stabbing, radiating to his left arm and jaw, lasting for several minutes at a time, and occurring mostly during times of stress or physical exertion. His ECGs have been normal on each occasion he presented with chest pain, but he remains convinced that he has angina pectoris despite reassurances from his doctors that there is no evidence to support this diagnosis. What is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient? 

A. Coronary angiography 
B. Stress echocardiography 
C. Cognitive behavioural therapy 
D. Beta-blockers 
E. Aspirin 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with medically unexplained chest pain (MUCP), which can be managed with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to address the underlying psychological factors contributing to the symptoms. Coronary angiography and stress echocardiography are not indicated in this case as there is no evidence of coronary artery disease, and beta-blockers or aspirin are unlikely to be effective.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents with a history of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and diarrhoea for the past year. She has undergone multiple investigations including blood tests, stool cultures, colonoscopy, and CT scan of the abdomen without any organic cause being identified. On examination, she appears anxious and reports tenderness on palpation of her abdomen. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Irritable bowel syndrome 
B. Inflammatory bowel disease 
C. Coeliac disease 
D. Diverticulitis 
E. Colon cancer 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterised by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of any organic pathology. IBS is often associated with anxiety and depression, and management involves lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes, stress reduction techniques, and pharmacological interventions such as antispasmodics or antidepressants if necessary.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a sore throat that has been progressively worsening over the last week. He reports difficulty swallowing, hoarseness of voice and feverishness. The patient is a smoker and has a history of heavy alcohol consumption. On examination, there are enlarged cervical lymph nodes on both sides of his neck, bilateral tonsillar enlargement with exudates, and erythema extending into the soft palate. The doctor suspects epiglottitis or peritonsillar abscess as possible diagnoses.

Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be most appropriate in this scenario? 

A. Throat culture
B. Rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus 
C. Blood cultures
D. CT scan of the head and neck 
E. MRI of the head and neck

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Given the severity of symptoms along with physical exam findings suggestive of epiglottitis or peritonsillar abscess, imaging studies should be performed urgently to rule out these conditions before any further management can be initiated. CT scan is preferred over MRI due to its wider availability, shorter acquisition time, lower cost and better sensitivity in detecting airway obstruction.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of sore throat that started suddenly yesterday evening after attending a party where she had shared drinks with friends. She also reports feeling unwell, having chills and body aches since then but denies cough or runny nose. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent episodes of tonsillitis requiring frequent courses of antibiotics.

On examination, her temperature is 38°C and there are tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy and marked erythema involving both tonsils without any exudate present.

Which one of the following organisms is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation? 

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Haemophilus influenzae 
C. Epstein-Barr virus 
D. Group A Streptococcus 
E. Mycoplasma pneumoniae

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The sudden onset of sore throat, fever and lymphadenopathy after attending a social gathering is suggestive of acute infectious mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV pharyngitis typically presents with marked tonsillar erythema without exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly in some cases.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of recurrent episodes of sore throat that have been occurring every month for the last 6 months. He reports experiencing severe pain on swallowing along with difficulty speaking during these episodes which usually resolve within a week even without treatment.

On examination, there are no significant findings except for mild bilateral tonsillar enlargement without any exudates present.

Which one of the following management options would be most appropriate? 

A. Referral to an ENT specialist for tonsillectomy
B. Empiric antibiotics for each episode
C. Throat swab culture and sensitivity testing
D. Symptomatic relief with analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Recurrent episodes of sore throat can be due to various causes including bacterial infections, viral infections or non-infectious etiologies such as allergies or acid reflux disease. In this patient, it is important to identify the causative organism before initiating any further management plan.
Throat swab culture and sensitivity testing should be performed during an active episode to determine if antibiotic therapy is necessary or not based on the results obtained from microbiological analysis.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a history of progressive speech and language problems over the last few months. She has difficulty finding the right words to express herself, often repeats phrases, and struggles to understand complex sentences. On examination, she is found to have mild weakness in her left arm and leg, but no other neurological deficits are noted.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Alzheimer's disease
B. Primary progressive aphasia
C. Frontotemporal dementia
D. Parkinson's disease dementia
E. Huntington's disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest primary progressive aphasia (PPA), which is characterized by gradual loss of language function due to degeneration of brain cells in areas responsible for language processing. Other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia may also present with similar symptoms but would typically have additional cognitive or behavioral changes beyond just language impairment.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents with sudden onset slurred speech and drooping on one side of his face that started earlier today while he was at work. He denies any headache or neck stiffness but reports some numbness on his right hand and foot.

On examination, there is asymmetry of facial features with flattening of the nasolabial fold on the affected side, inability to close his right eye completely, and drooling from the corner of his mouth on that side. His tongue deviates towards the affected side when protruded, and there is mild weakness in his right upper limb compared to the left.

What is the most likely cause of this presentation? 

A. Ischemic stroke 
B. Hemorrhagic stroke 
C. Bell's palsy 
D. Multiple sclerosis 
E. Brain tumor 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest an acute ischemic stroke involving the left middle cerebral artery territory, which can cause weakness of the right face and arm, as well as speech and language problems. Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion when no other neurological deficits are present, while multiple sclerosis or brain tumor would typically have more gradual onset and/or additional symptoms beyond just facial droop and slurred speech.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with difficulty speaking clearly for the past few weeks. She reports that her voice sounds hoarse and strained, especially towards the end of the day or after prolonged talking. She denies any pain or discomfort in her throat but has noticed some occasional choking episodes while eating.

On examination, there is no obvious abnormality on inspection of the oral cavity or neck. However, laryngoscopy reveals bilateral vocal cord paralysis with incomplete adduction during phonation.

What is the most likely cause of this presentation? 

A. Idiopathic vocal cord paralysis 
B. Laryngeal cancer 
C. Myasthenia gravis 
D. Guillain-Barre syndrome 
E. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, which can be caused by damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve due to viral infections, trauma, surgery, or tumors in the chest or neck area. Other causes such as laryngeal cancer or neuromuscular disorders like myasthenia gravis or ALS may also present with similar symptoms but would typically have additional findings on examination or investigation beyond just vocal cord paralysis.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with a history of intermittent diplopia and headaches for the past few months. On examination, you notice that her right eye turns inwards when she looks to the left and outwards when she looks to the right. She has normal visual acuity, but there is an esotropia of 20 prism diopters at distance and near with no suppression or amblyopia.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Accommodative Esotropia
B. Convergence Insufficiency
C. Sixth Nerve Palsy
D. Duane Syndrome Type I
E. Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with double vision that worsens on looking down and to his left side. He also reports difficulty reading small print without holding it close to his face.

On examination, you note that he has a head tilt towards his right shoulder, and his left eye appears elevated in primary gaze position with a hypertropia of 10 prism diopters in upgaze and downgaze positions.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Brown Syndrome
B. Superior Oblique Myokymia
C. Fourth Nerve Palsy
D. Skew Deviation 
E. Trochlear Nerve Schwannoma

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with fourth nerve palsy, which causes vertical diplopia that worsens on looking down and towards the affected side due to weakness of the superior oblique muscle.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with a history of double vision that worsens on looking to her right side. She also reports difficulty reading small print without holding it close to her face.

On examination, you note that she has an exotropia of 15 prism diopters in primary gaze position, which increases to 25 prism diopters on looking towards the right side. There is no evidence of amblyopia or suppression.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Sixth Nerve Palsy
B. Convergence Insufficiency
C. Accommodative Esotropia
D. Duane Syndrome Type III
E. Divergence Excess

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with divergence excess, which causes an intermittent exotropia that increases on looking towards the affected side due to overaction of the lateral rectus muscles.

Question
A 6-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of stridor and difficulty breathing. His parents report that he has had a persistent cough for the past week, but it had been improving until today when he suddenly became very unwell. On examination, the child is in respiratory distress with marked inspiratory stridor and intercostal recession. Oxygen saturation is 88% on room air.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute epiglottitis
B. Foreign body aspiration
C. Retropharyngeal abscess
D. Laryngomalacia
E. Tracheoesophageal fistula

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presentation of sudden onset stridor and respiratory distress in a previously well child raises concern for foreign body aspiration as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 2-month-old infant presents to the paediatric clinic with noisy breathing since birth which has gradually worsened over time, particularly during feeding and when lying flat on their back.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is a common condition in older men. Alpha-blockers such as tamsulosin can improve urinary flow and reduce symptoms by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to his GP with a complaint of blood in his urine for the past week. He reports no pain or other urinary symptoms, but he has a history of smoking and exposure to industrial chemicals. On examination, there is no abdominal tenderness or masses palpated; however, digital rectal examination reveals an enlarged prostate gland without nodules or induration.

What would be the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Refer for cystoscopy 
B. Order CT urogram 
C. Order renal ultrasound 
D. Start antibiotics empirically 
E. Monitor with repeat urinalysis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's age, smoking history, and occupational exposure increase his risk for bladder cancer, which can present with painless hematuria as the only symptom initially. A CT urogram is recommended as it provides better visualization of the upper urinary tract than cystoscopy alone and can help detect any associated abnormalities such as hydronephrosis or ureteric obstruction that may require urgent intervention.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP for a routine check-up. She has no significant medical history and is not on any medications. Her vaccination records reveal that she received the hepatitis B vaccine as a child, but has not had any other vaccinations since then.

After discussing the benefits of vaccination with her GP, she agrees to receive all recommended vaccines for adults. Which of the following vaccines should be administered first?

A. Influenza
B. Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)
C. Varicella
D. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13)
E. Human papillomavirus (HPV)

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) should be administered first in this patient, followed by the influenza vaccine and then MMR and varicella if needed. This is because PCV13 provides protection against serious infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can be life-threatening in older adults or those with certain medical conditions.

This involves exposing the patient's airways to a known irritant or allergen and measuring their response using spirometry before and after exposure.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse presents to the emergency department with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting. His blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, heart rate is 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals the following results:
pH: 7.20
PaCO2: 30 mmHg
HCO3-: 12 mEq/L
What acid-base disturbance does this patient have? What is the most likely underlying cause? Which compensatory mechanism has been activated? What would be the appropriate management for this patient?

A. Metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis
B. Respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation
C. Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis due to renal failure
D. Metabolic alkalosis due to excessive vomiting
E. Respiratory acidosis due to opioid overdose

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient has a metabolic acidosis as evidenced by low pH and HCO3-. The anion gap calculation [(Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + HCO3-)] is elevated at 18 mEq/L indicating an increased concentration of unmeasured anions in the plasma such as lactate or ketones which are commonly seen in alcoholic ketoacidosis. The respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis should result in hypoventilation leading to an increase in PaCO2 but instead there is hyperventilation resulting in a decrease in PaCO2 suggesting that the primary respiratory disorder is not present or may be masked by another process.

Question
A 65-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents with worsening shortness of breath over the past week despite being compliant with her home oxygen therapy regimen. She reports coughing up yellow sputum and has a fever of 38.5°C. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals the following results:
pH: 7.28
PaCO2: 60 mmHg
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
What acid-base disturbance does this patient have? What is the most likely underlying cause? Which compensatory mechanism has been activated? What would be the appropriate management for this patient?

A. Respiratory acidosis due to COPD exacerbation
B. Metabolic alkalosis due to diuretic use
C. Mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis due to sepsis
D. Respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation from anxiety
E. Metabolic acidosis due to renal failure

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient has a respiratory acidosis as evidenced by low pH and high PaCO2 which is consistent with her history of COPD exacerbation leading to hypoventilation resulting in retention of carbon dioxide. There is no evidence of metabolic compensation as HCO3- is within normal range indicating that the kidneys have not had time to compensate yet.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for two days after consuming raw oysters at a local seafood restaurant. He reports feeling weak and dizzy upon standing up and his blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg while lying down but drops further when he stands up to 70/40 mmHg with an increase in heart rate from 80 bpm supine to 120 bpm upright position. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals the following results:
pH: 7.50
PaCO2: 30 mmHg
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
What acid-base disturbance does this patient have? What is the most likely underlying cause? Which compensatory mechanism has been activated? What would be the appropriate management for this patient?

A. Respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation
B. Metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis
C. Mixed metabolic and respiratory alkalosis due to sepsis
D. Metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting
E. Respiratory acidosis due to opioid overdose

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient has a respiratory alkalosis as evidenced by high pH and low PaCO2 which is consistent with hyperventilation likely secondary to dehydration, volume depletion, or autonomic dysfunction from bacterial infection after consuming raw oysters causing gastroenteritis leading to metabolic acidosis but there is no evidence of metabolic compensation as HCO3- is within normal range indicating that the kidneys have not had time to compensate yet. Management should focus on fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of underlying infection if present.

Question
A 65-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with a history of fever, headache, and confusion for the past two weeks. He has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. On examination, he is febrile with a temperature of 39°C, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Neurological examination reveals mild disorientation and weakness in his left upper limb. CT scan shows a ring-enhancing lesion in the right parietal lobe suggestive of brain abscess.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset severe pain in his left eye, associated with nausea and vomiting. On examination, his left eye appears red and hazy cornea is noted. The intraocular pressure (IOP) in the affected eye is elevated at 50 mmHg.

Which of the following is true regarding acute glaucoma? 

A. It occurs more commonly in younger individuals.
B. It is characterized by a gradual increase in IOP over weeks to months.
C. Pilocarpine should be avoided as it can exacerbate symptoms.
D. Acetazolamide should be given intravenously for rapid reduction of IOP.
E. Gonioscopy is not required for diagnosis.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Acute glaucoma typically presents with sudden onset severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated IOP (>21 mmHg). It usually occurs in older individuals and can lead to irreversible vision loss if not treated promptly. Pilocarpine eyedrops are used to constrict the pupil and open up the drainage angle; however, they should be avoided during an acute attack as they can worsen symptoms initially due to increased pressure on the iris-lens diaphragm. Intravenous acetazolamide is recommended for rapid reduction of IOP along with topical beta-blockers and alpha-agonists. Gonioscopy is essential for diagnosing different types of glaucoma.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with complaints of blurred vision in her right eye that has been gradually worsening over several months, accompanied by mild discomfort around her eyes and occasional headaches.

On examination, visual acuity in both eyes was 6/6 but there was a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) present on the right side compared to the left side which had normal pupils bilaterally. Intraocular pressure was 18 mmHg in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed cupping of the optic disc and thinning of the neuroretinal rim in the right eye.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute angle-closure glaucoma
B. Chronic open-angle glaucoma
C. Anterior uveitis 
D. Optic neuritis 
E. Central retinal vein occlusion

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The symptoms described are suggestive of chronic open-angle glaucoma, which is characterized by gradual onset painless loss of peripheral vision with a cup-to-disc ratio greater than 0.6 and thinning of the neuroretinal rim on fundoscopy. RAPD may be present if there is significant asymmetry between the two eyes, but IOP usually remains within normal limits until late stages of the disease. Acute angle-closure glaucoma presents with sudden onset severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated IOP (>21 mmHg). Anterior uveitis typically presents with redness, photophobia, and pain around the eye while optic neuritis presents with visual loss and dyschromatopsia (color vision disturbance). Central retinal vein occlusion presents with sudden onset painless loss of vision associated with a relative afferent pupillary defect.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his optometrist for routine check-up where he was found to have raised intraocular pressure (IOP) in both eyes without any other symptoms or signs.

On further evaluation, it was noted that his father had lost his sight due to glaucoma at an early age.

Which of the following is true regarding primary open-angle glaucoma? 

A. It occurs more commonly in individuals below 40 years.
B. It has no genetic predisposition.
C. Peripheral visual field defects occur before central visual acuity loss.
D. The first-line treatment is laser trabeculoplasty.
E. It presents with sudden onset severe pain and redness of the eye.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy characterized by elevated IOP, cupping of the optic disc, and visual field defects that occur initially in the periphery before affecting central vision. POAG has a strong genetic predisposition with a positive family history being an important risk factor for developing the disease. It occurs more commonly in individuals above 40 years of age. First-line treatment options include topical medications such as prostaglandin analogs or beta-blockers; however, laser trabeculoplasty may be considered if medical therapy fails to control IOP adequately. Sudden onset severe pain and redness of the eye are typical features of acute angle-closure glaucoma rather than POAG.

Question
A 22-year-old woman presents to the Sexual Health Clinic with complaints of vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain for the past week. She reports having unprotected sexual intercourse with a new partner two weeks ago. On examination, her cervix appears erythematous with mucopurulent discharge. A high vaginal swab is taken for microscopy, culture, and sensitivity testing.
Which of the following statements regarding chlamydial infection is true? 

A. Chlamydia trachomatis can cause urethritis in men but not women
B. The gold standard test for diagnosing chlamydial infection is PCR
C. Azithromycin should be avoided in pregnant women due to its teratogenic effects
D. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) caused by chlamydia can lead to infertility if left untreated
E. Doxycycline is contraindicated in patients under 18 years of age

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted infections worldwide and can cause urethritis in both men and women. While PCR is highly sensitive and specific for detecting chlamydial infection, it may not be available or affordable in all settings; therefore, other tests such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are also used for diagnosis. Azithromycin is considered safe during pregnancy and is often used to treat chlamydial infections in pregnant women due to its long half-life and single-dose regimen; however, tetracyclines like doxycycline are contraindicated in pregnancy due to their potential teratogenic effects on fetal bone development.

Question
A 26-year-old man presents to his GP with dysuria and urethral discharge that started three days ago after having unprotected sexual intercourse with a casual partner he met at a bar. On examination, his urethral meatus is erythematous with purulent discharge. A Gram stain of the discharge reveals gram-negative diplococci.
Which of the following statements regarding gonorrhoea and chlamydial infections is true? 

A. Chlamydia trachomatis can cause epididymitis in men but not women
B. The treatment for gonorrhoea includes a single dose of azithromycin
C. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) caused by gonorrhoea is less likely to lead to infertility than PID caused by chlamydia
D. Gonorrhoea can be diagnosed using PCR or NAATs from a urine sample in both men and women
E. Doxycycline is the preferred treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhoea

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: While both gonorrhoea and chlamydial infections are sexually transmitted bacterial infections that can cause dysuria and urethral discharge, they have different clinical features and complications. Chlamydia trachomatis can cause epididymitis in men as well as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, which if left untreated, can lead to infertility due to scarring of the fallopian tubes. The recommended treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhoea includes ceftriaxone plus either azithromycin or doxycycline; however, azithromycin alone may not be effective against all strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae due to increasing antibiotic resistance.

Question
A 30-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding after having unprotected sexual intercourse with her new partner two weeks ago. She reports no history of sexually transmitted infections or previous pregnancies.
On examination, she has cervical motion tenderness and bilateral adnexal tenderness on bimanual examination. A transvaginal ultrasound shows a complex adnexal mass and free fluid in the pelvis.
Which of the following statements regarding pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is true? 

A. PID can be caused by bacterial vaginosis
B. The most common cause of PID in the UK is Neisseria gonorrhoeae
C. Chlamydia trachomatis is not associated with tubo-ovarian abscesses in patients with PID
D. Treatment for mild-to-moderate PID includes oral doxycycline plus metronidazole
E. Patients with severe or complicated PID may require hospital admission and intravenous antibiotics

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper female genital tract that can lead to serious complications such as infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy if left untreated. It is usually caused by sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea; however, other organisms such as Mycoplasma genitalium and anaerobes may also be involved. Bacterial vaginosis is not considered a cause of PID but may increase the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections that can lead to PID. While both chlamydial infection and gonorrhoea are common causes of PID, chlamydia is more commonly associated with tubo-ovarian abscesses due to its ability to invade fallopian tube epithelium and form microcolonies within the tissue. Treatment for mild-to-moderate PID typically involves oral antibiotics such as doxycycline plus metronidazole; however, patients with severe or complicated cases may require hospital admission and intravenous antibiotics for optimal management.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of persistent worry and anxiety for the past year.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Prescribe benzodiazepines
B. Refer for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
C. Order a brain MRI
D. Start on high-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
E. Recommend herbal supplements

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Referral for CBT is recommended as first-line treatment for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) by NICE guidelines due to its effectiveness in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life without causing significant side effects. Benzodiazepines are not recommended as first-line treatment due to their potential for dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Brain imaging studies are not indicated unless there are specific neurological signs or symptoms present. High-dose SSRIs may cause adverse effects without providing additional benefit compared to standard doses. Herbal supplements lack sufficient evidence for efficacy and safety in treating GAD.

Question
A 25-year-old female patient presents with symptoms of coeliac disease, including abdominal pain and bloating, diarrhea, and weight loss. She has a family history of the condition. Blood tests reveal elevated levels of tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-IgA). However, her small intestinal biopsy is negative for villous atrophy or crypt hyperplasia. What could be the reason for this discrepancy? 

A. The patient may have early-stage coeliac disease that has not yet caused significant damage to the intestinal lining.
B. The blood test results may be false positive due to other autoimmune conditions.
C. The biopsy sample may not have been taken from an affected area of the intestine.
D. The patient may have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity instead of coeliac disease.
E. The patient's symptoms may be due to another underlying condition.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In some cases, patients with coeliac disease may have normal or only mildly abnormal small intestinal biopsies despite having elevated tTG-IgA levels and clinical symptoms consistent with the condition. This can occur in early-stage or mild forms of the disease where there is minimal damage to the intestinal lining.

Question
A 35-year-old male patient was diagnosed with coeliac disease several years ago and has been following a strict gluten-free diet ever since. He now presents with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea despite adhering to his dietary restrictions. His blood tests show persistently high levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-IgA). What could be causing his ongoing symptoms? 

A. Cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods
B. Development of refractory coeliac disease
C. Non-compliance with medication regimen
D. Co-existing inflammatory bowel disease
E. Psychological factors such as stress or anxiety

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Refractory coeliac disease is a rare complication of coeliac disease where patients continue to experience symptoms and have elevated tTG-IgA levels despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. This can occur due to the development of abnormal T-cell populations in the intestinal lining that are resistant to treatment.

Question
A 42-year-old female patient presents with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and iron-deficiency anemia. She has a family history of coeliac disease but her blood tests for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-IgA) are negative. However, her small intestinal biopsy reveals villous atrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis consistent with coeliac disease. What could be causing the negative blood test results? 

A. The patient may have IgA deficiency
B. The patient may have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity instead of coeliac disease
C. The patient's sample may have been mishandled or contaminated during testing
D. The patient may not have consumed enough gluten prior to testing for accurate results
E. The patient's immune system may not produce detectable levels of tTG-IgA antibodies

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Some individuals with coeliac disease also have selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency, which can cause false-negative results on tTG-IgA blood tests as these rely on the presence of IgA antibodies for accuracy. In such cases, alternative testing methods such as IgG-based assays or genetic testing may be used for diagnosis.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with palpitations and chest pain that started suddenly while he was at rest. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. On examination, his blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, heart rate is 180 bpm irregularly irregular, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Electrocardiography shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute coronary syndrome
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
D. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy 
E. Ventricular tachycardia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to the sudden onset of chest pain at rest, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and electrocardiographic changes showing ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4. Although atrial fibrillation can be associated with ACS as well as other conditions such as pulmonary embolism or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the presence of ST-segment elevation suggests an ischemic cause.

Question
A 62-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of intermittent episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness over the past few weeks. She denies any chest pain or shortness of breath but reports occasional palpitations during these episodes.

Question
A 75-year-old man with a history of peripheral arterial disease presents to the clinic with an ulcer on his right foot that has been present for several weeks. He reports intermittent claudication and numbness in both feet, which he attributes to his diabetes. On examination, there is a deep ulcer located over the lateral aspect of the foot, measuring approximately 4cm in diameter. The surrounding skin appears shiny and taut, with absent hair growth and cool temperature. There is no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse on the affected side.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Venous ulceration
B. Neuropathic ulceration
C. Pyoderma gangrenosum
D. Warfarin necrosis
E. Arterial ulceration

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with an arterial ulcer, which typically occurs due to ischemia resulting from reduced blood flow to the affected area. This can be caused by conditions such as peripheral arterial disease or diabetes mellitus, which are associated with microvascular damage and impaired wound healing. The presence of absent pulses, cool skin temperature, and shiny taut skin are all indicative of arterial insufficiency.

Question
A 68-year-old woman presents to her GP practice complaining of pain in her left leg that has been progressively worsening over the last few months. She reports experiencing cramping pain in her calf when walking short distances, which resolves after resting for a few minutes. She also notes that her toes have become increasingly cold and discoloured over time.
On examination, there is evidence of pallor in the left foot compared to the right foot at rest; however, this improves slightly on elevation of the limb above heart level (dependent rubor).

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents to the GP with a complaint of vaginal dryness and painful intercourse for the past year. She has been postmenopausal for 10 years and has not used any hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She also reports some urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and occasional incontinence. On examination, there is marked atrophy of the vulva and vagina with loss of rugae. The pH of the vaginal discharge is elevated (>5) and there is no evidence of infection or malignancy on speculum examination. Which one of the following options would be most appropriate first-line management? 

A. Topical oestrogen
B. Systemic HRT
C. Vaginal moisturisers
D. Antibiotics 
E. Pelvic floor exercises

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Atrophic vaginitis is a common condition that occurs due to decreased levels of estrogen after menopause leading to thinning, drying, and inflammation of the vaginal walls which can cause pain during sex (dyspareunia), itching, burning sensation, recurrent UTIs, and urinary incontinence. Topical estrogen therapy is considered first-line treatment for women with symptomatic atrophic vaginitis who are not candidates for systemic hormone therapy.

Question
A 58-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of persistent vaginal bleeding despite being postmenopausal for six years. She denies any history of pelvic pain or dyspareunia but reports having hot flushes occasionally over the last few months along with fatigue and weight gain around her abdomen area.
On examination, she appears well but slightly overweight (BMI = 29 kg/m²). Speculum examination reveals an enlarged uterus with thickened endometrium visible through the cervical os.
Which one of the following investigations should be performed next? 

A. Endometrial biopsy
B. Transvaginal ultrasound
C. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
D. MRI of the pelvis 
E. Hysteroscopy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Postmenopausal bleeding is an alarming symptom that requires prompt evaluation to rule out endometrial cancer, which is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries. Endometrial biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing endometrial cancer or its precursors in women with postmenopausal bleeding.

Question
A 70-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of vaginal discharge and itching for several months. She has a history of recurrent UTIs and was treated recently with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI). She also reports some mild stress urinary incontinence but denies any pelvic pain or dyspareunia.
On examination, there is marked atrophy of the vulva and vagina with loss of rugae. The pH of the vaginal discharge is elevated (>5) and there are no signs of infection or malignancy on speculum examination.
Which one of the following options would be most appropriate first-line management? 

A. Topical oestrogen
B. Systemic HRT
C. Vaginal moisturisers
D. Antibiotics 
E. Pelvic floor exercises

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Recurrent UTIs are common in postmenopausal women due to decreased estrogen levels leading to changes in vaginal flora and increased susceptibility to uropathogens such as E.coli. Vaginal moisturizers can help relieve symptoms associated with atrophic vaginitis by providing lubrication and hydration to the vaginal tissues without containing hormones or antimicrobial agents which can disrupt normal vaginal flora, making them suitable for women who have had recent antibiotic treatment for UTI's or other infections that may cause secondary vaginitis-like symptoms such as candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis.

Question
A 62-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling in her fingers, toes, and knees over the past year. She reports that each episode lasts for several days and is associated with severe pain, redness, and warmth around the affected joints. The patient has a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both well controlled on medication. Physical examination reveals tender, swollen joints in the hands and feet bilaterally.
Which of the following statements regarding crystal arthropathy is true?

A. Pseudogout is caused by deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints
B. Gout typically affects multiple small joints in a symmetrical pattern
C. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals are positively birefringent under polarized light microscopy
D. Septic arthritis can be differentiated from crystal arthropathies based on synovial fluid analysis alone
E. Treatment options for acute gout include colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or steroids

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling suggest a possible diagnosis of crystal arthropathy such as gout or pseudogout. In this case, given the age and presentation with involvement of larger joints such as knees, pseudogout may be more likely than gout. CPPD crystals are weakly positively birefringent under polarized light microscopy while urate crystals are negatively birefringent. Synovial fluid analysis can help differentiate between septic arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis but clinical correlation is necessary.

Question
A 48-year-old man presents to his GP with an acutely painful left ankle which he describes as being "red hot" to touch over the past day after twisting it during football practice earlier that week. He has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications. Examination reveals a swollen, erythematous ankle with tenderness on palpation over the lateral malleolus.
Which of the following statements regarding crystal arthropathy is true?

A. Gout can present acutely as monoarticular arthritis
B. Pseudogout typically affects weight-bearing joints such as hips or knees
C. Allopurinol is first-line treatment for acute pseudogout attacks
D. Calcium hydroxyapatite crystals are negatively birefringent under polarized light microscopy
E. Rheumatoid arthritis commonly presents as an acute inflammatory monoarthritis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Acute onset of joint pain and swelling after trauma raises suspicion for crystal arthropathies such as gout or pseudogout. While both conditions can affect any joint, gout more commonly presents acutely as monoarticular arthritis in smaller joints such as ankles or toes while pseudogout tends to affect larger joints such as knees or hips. Treatment options for acute gout include colchicine, NSAIDs, or steroids depending on comorbidities.

Question
A 58-year-old man presents to his GP with recurrent episodes of painful swelling in his right wrist over the past year which have been increasing in frequency and severity despite taking ibuprofen as needed for pain relief. He has a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both well controlled on medication. Physical examination reveals a tender, swollen right wrist with limited range of motion.
Which of the following statements regarding crystal arthropathy is true? 

A. CPPD deposition disease may be associated with other metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism or hemochromatosis
B. Gouty tophi are most commonly found in subcutaneous tissue around large joints
C. Septic arthritis should always be considered in patients with a history of joint pain and swelling
D. Pseudogout is caused by deposition of urate crystals in the joints
E. Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents as an acute inflammatory monoarthritis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Recurrent episodes of painful swelling in a single joint raises suspicion for crystal arthropathy such as gout or pseudogout, but other forms of inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis should also be considered. CPPD deposition disease may be associated with metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism or hemochromatosis, and can present similarly to gout or pseudogout. Gouty tophi are most commonly found in subcutaneous tissue around smaller joints such as fingers or toes rather than larger joints like knees or hips. Septic arthritis requires prompt diagnosis and treatment given its potential for rapid joint destruction if left untreated.

Question
A 16-year-old boy is brought to the GP by his mother due to concerns about his behaviour and academic performance. The parent explains that her son has always been easily distracted, impulsive, and forgetful. He often interrupts others during conversations and struggles to follow instructions.

Which of the following should be included in the initial assessment? 

A. A full blood count
B. An electroencephalogram (EEG)
C. A hearing test
D. A vision test 
E. A developmental assessment

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The child's behaviour suggests possible ADHD, which requires a comprehensive developmental assessment that includes cognitive, social-emotional, and behavioural domains to rule out other conditions such as learning disabilities or anxiety disorders that may present with similar symptoms.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of weight gain, easy bruising, and muscle weakness for the past year. She also reports having irregular menstrual cycles and excessive hair growth on her face and body. On examination, she has central obesity, moon facies, and purple striae over her abdomen. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated cortisol levels in the morning but fail to suppress after overnight dexamethasone suppression test.

Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation? 

A. Ectopic ACTH syndrome
B. Adrenal adenoma
C. Pituitary adenoma
D. Carcinoid tumor
E. Pheochromocytoma

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical features described suggest Cushing's syndrome which can be caused by either exogenous glucocorticoids or endogenous hypercortisolism due to adrenal or pituitary gland pathology. In this case, laboratory findings indicate that cortisol secretion is not suppressed by dexamethasone administration suggesting an ACTH-dependent source such as a pituitary adenoma.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight gain over the last six months despite no changes in his diet or exercise routine. He reports feeling depressed and anxious lately and has noticed increased thirst and urination frequency recently along with decreased libido. On physical examination, he has truncal obesity with thin extremities, buffalo hump, moon facies, acne on his chest and back along with multiple bruises on his arms.

What is the most appropriate initial investigation? 

A) Serum cortisol level 
B) Dexamethasone suppression test 
C) Urinary free cortisol measurement 
D) Plasma ACTH level 
E) MRI brain scan

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical picture suggests Cushing’s syndrome, which is characterized by hypercortisolism. The initial investigation for Cushing’s syndrome is a dexamethasone suppression test to differentiate between ACTH-dependent and independent causes of the disease.

Question
A 38-year-old woman presents with symptoms of weight gain, easy bruising, muscle weakness, and menstrual irregularities over the past year. She also reports having recurrent infections and poor wound healing despite no underlying medical conditions. On examination, she has central obesity with thin extremities, moon facies, and multiple purple striae on her abdomen along with proximal muscle weakness.

Which one of the following tests would be most appropriate? 

A) Serum cortisol level 
B) Dexamethasone suppression test 
C) Urinary free cortisol measurement 
D) Plasma ACTH level 
E) CRH stimulation test

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features suggest Cushing's syndrome due to endogenous glucocorticoid excess. In this case, it is important to determine whether the source of hypercortisolism is pituitary or ectopic in origin. A CRH stimulation test can help distinguish between these two sources as patients with pituitary adenomas will have an exaggerated response to CRH while those with ectopic ACTH secretion will not respond at all.

Question
A 5-year-old boy is brought to the GP by his parents with concerns about his behaviour. They report that he has difficulty making eye contact, does not respond when called by name and prefers to play alone rather than with other children. He also engages in repetitive behaviours such as flapping his hands and spinning around in circles. The parents have noticed that their son seems to be very sensitive to certain sounds, textures and smells which can cause him distress. On further questioning, the parents reveal that they have a family history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
B. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
C. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
D. Oppositional defiant disorder
E. Conduct disorder

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The child's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of ASD, particularly given the family history of the condition.

Question
A 14-year-old girl is referred for assessment due to concerns about her social communication skills at school. She struggles to understand sarcasm or jokes made by her peers and often takes language literally, leading to misunderstandings in conversations.

Which one of the following conditions is most likely? 

A. Social anxiety disorder
B. Generalized anxiety disorder
C. Autism spectrum disorder 
D. Specific phobia 
E. Panic disorder 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms suggest difficulties with social communication and interaction, along with restrictive/repetitive behaviours - all core features of ASD.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of persistent feelings of loneliness despite having a job and living independently. He reports that he has always struggled to form close relationships with others, finding it difficult to understand social cues and engage in small talk. He also finds it challenging to maintain eye contact during conversations. The patient's medical history is unremarkable, but his mother reports that he was diagnosed with ASD as a child.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Major depressive disorder
B. Generalized anxiety disorder 
C. Autism spectrum disorder 
D. Schizoid personality disorder 
E. Avoidant personality disorder

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's difficulties with forming close relationships, along with his preference for solitary activities and lack of interest in social interaction suggest schizoid personality disorder as a possible diagnosis, which can co-occur with ASD.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to the dermatology clinic with a 6-month history of a pruritic, erythematous rash on his trunk and extremities. The rash has not responded to topical steroids or antifungal creams. On examination, there are multiple annular plaques with central clearing and raised borders.

What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient? 

A. Topical clotrimazole
B. Oral terbinafine
C. Intravenous amphotericin B
D. Systemic corticosteroids 
E. Phototherapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Tinea corporis is a cutaneous fungal infection caused by dermatophytes that commonly affects the trunk and extremities. Treatment options include topical or oral antifungal agents depending on the severity and extent of the disease. In this case, due to the widespread nature of the lesions, oral terbinafine would be the most appropriate treatment option.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents to her GP with a 2-week history of an itchy rash on her groin area that has not improved despite using over-the-counter antifungal cream for one week.
On examination, there are well-demarcated erythematous patches with peripheral scaling involving both inguinal folds extending onto her upper thighs bilaterally.
Which of the following is NOT a risk factor for developing tinea cruris? 

A. Obesity 
B. Diabetes mellitus 
C. Hot and humid climate
D. Tight-fitting clothing 
E. Use of public swimming pools

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Tinea cruris is a common cutaneous fungal infection affecting the groin area caused by dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum or Epidermophyton floccosum. Risk factors include obesity, diabetes mellitus, hot and humid climate, tight-fitting clothing, poor hygiene, and immunosuppression. Use of public swimming pools is not a known risk factor for tinea cruris.

Nail clippings sent for microbiological testing confirm the presence of dermatophytes.
What is the most appropriate treatment option? 

A. Topical amorolfine 5% nail lacquer
B. Oral terbinafine 
C. Oral itraconazole 
D. Laser therapy 
E. Surgical removal of affected nails

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Onychomycosis is a common fungal infection affecting the nails caused by dermatophytes or yeasts such as Candida albicans or non-dermatophyte molds. Treatment options include topical antifungal agents such as amorolfine or ciclopirox nail lacquers, oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine or itraconazole, laser therapy, or surgical removal of affected nails depending on the severity and extent of disease. In this case, due to the moderate-severe nature of the infection involving multiple nails bilaterally, oral terbinafine would be the most appropriate treatment option.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a history of recurrent vaginal discharge for the past six months. She reports that her symptoms worsen after sexual intercourse and during menstruation. On examination, there is no erythema or swelling in the vulva or vagina. The pH of the vaginal discharge is greater than 4.5, and microscopy reveals clue cells and a decreased number of lactobacilli.
Which one of the following is not a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis? 

A. Multiple sexual partners
B. Smoking
C. Use of intrauterine devices (IUDs)
D. Antibiotic use
E. Oral contraceptive pill

E. Oral acitretin

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Topical salicylic acid is an effective treatment option for common warts like those seen in this patient, especially when used in combination with cryotherapy or other physical modalities such as curettage or electrocautery if needed. Intralesional bleomycin injection therapy and podophyllin resin application are generally reserved for more resistant or extensive lesions, while oral acitretin is typically used only in severe cases of psoriasis or other hyperkeratotic disorders.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of a slowly growing lesion on her nose for the past year. On examination, there is a pearly papule with rolled edges and telangiectasia in the center. The patient has no significant medical history and takes no regular medications. The GP suspects basal cell carcinoma and requests a biopsy which confirms the diagnosis.

Which one of the following statements regarding basal cell carcinoma is correct?

A. It commonly metastasizes to regional lymph nodes
B. It is associated with high levels of UV radiation exposure
C. It typically presents as an erythematous plaque with scaling
D. Mohs micrographic surgery is not recommended for its treatment
E. Systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 80% of all non-melanoma skin cancers. It arises from basal cells in the epidermis and usually occurs on sun-exposed areas such as the face, scalp, neck, and upper trunk. Risk factors include fair skin, chronic sun exposure, older age, male gender, immunosuppression, and genetic predisposition (e.g., Gorlin syndrome). BCC rarely metastasizes but can invade locally if left untreated or inadequately treated. Treatment options include surgical excision, cryotherapy, curettage and electrodessication (C&E), radiotherapy, topical therapy (e.g., imiquimod), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and Mohs micrographic surgery.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his dermatologist with multiple nodular lesions on his forehead that have been present for several years but have recently increased in size and number. He reports occasional bleeding from some of them when he shaves or scratches them accidentally. On examination, there are several pearly papules with telangiectasia and central ulceration. The dermatologist suspects basal cell carcinoma and orders a biopsy which confirms the diagnosis.

Which one of the following subtypes of basal cell carcinoma is most likely to be present in this patient?

A. Nodular
B. Superficial
C. Infiltrative
D. Morpheaform (sclerosing)
E. Pigmented

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) can present in various clinical forms including nodular, superficial, infiltrative, morpheaform (sclerosing), and pigmented variants. Nodular BCC is the most common subtype, accounting for approximately 60-80% of all cases. It typically presents as a pearly or translucent papule with rolled edges and telangiectasia in the center. Ulceration may occur if the lesion becomes traumatized or neglected. Superficial BCC accounts for approximately 10-15% of cases and usually presents as an erythematous scaly plaque that spreads centrifugally over weeks to months. Infiltrative BCC accounts for approximately 5-10% of cases and tends to invade deeply into surrounding tissues without well-defined borders. Morpheaform (sclerosing) BCC accounts for less than 5% of cases and appears as a flat or indurated plaque with ill-defined margins that mimic scar tissue or benign skin conditions such as psoriasis or eczema. Pigmented BCC accounts for less than 1% of cases and resembles melanoma clinically but has distinct histological features.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of a slowly growing lesion on her cheek for the past year. She reports occasional itching but no pain or bleeding from the lesion. On examination, there is a 1 cm-diameter pinkish plaque with fine scales and irregular borders. The GP suspects basal cell carcinoma and refers the patient to a dermatologist for further evaluation.

Which one of the following diagnostic modalities is most appropriate for confirming the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma in this patient?

A. Dermoscopy
B. High-frequency ultrasound
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
D. Computed tomography (CT) scan
E. Biopsy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) can be diagnosed clinically by its characteristic appearance on physical examination, but histopathological confirmation is necessary before definitive treatment can be planned. Biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing BCC and involves obtaining a tissue sample from the lesion under local anesthesia using a punch or shave technique. Histopathological analysis allows accurate classification of the tumor subtype, assessment of its depth and margins, and identification of any associated features such as perineural invasion or lymphovascular invasion that may affect prognosis and management decisions. Other diagnostic modalities such as dermoscopy, high-frequency ultrasound, MRI, and CT scan may be useful in selected cases where there is uncertainty about the diagnosis or suspicion of deeper invasion or metastasis, but they are not routinely recommended for initial evaluation or follow-up of BCC.

Question
A 30-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis presents to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and vomiting. She has a history of multiple hospital admissions for pulmonary exacerbations, but this is her first presentation with gastrointestinal symptoms. On examination, she has diffuse abdominal tenderness and guarding, and laboratory investigations reveal elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein levels.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

A. Pancreatitis
B. Intestinal obstruction
C. Appendicitis
D. Cholecystitis
E. Mesenteric ischemia

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Patients with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk of developing mesenteric ischemia due to chronic dehydration, hypovolemia, and hypercoagulability associated with the disease. The presenting symptoms can be nonspecific and mimic other causes of acute abdomen such as appendicitis or cholecystitis.

Question
A 25-year-old man with cystic fibrosis presents to his GP complaining of increasing shortness of breath over the past few weeks despite compliance with his respiratory medications. He reports coughing up thick sputum that is difficult to clear from his airways.

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Increase dose of inhaled corticosteroids
B. Prescribe oral antibiotics
C. Perform spirometry testing
D. Refer for lung transplant evaluation
E. Initiate non-invasive ventilation therapy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Spirometry testing should be performed to assess lung function and determine if there has been any decline since previous measurements were taken. This will help guide further management decisions such as adjusting medication doses or referring for specialist care.

Question
A 40-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis presents for routine follow-up with her gastroenterologist after undergoing a liver transplant two years ago due to cirrhosis secondary to cystic fibrosis-related liver disease. She reports feeling well overall but has noticed increasing fatigue and abdominal discomfort over the past few weeks.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

A. Acute rejection of liver transplant
B. Recurrence of cystic fibrosis-related liver disease
C. Hepatitis B virus reactivation
D. Portal vein thrombosis
E. Cholangiocarcinoma

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Portal vein thrombosis is a known complication after liver transplantation, particularly in patients with underlying cirrhosis or hypercoagulable states such as cystic fibrosis. It can present with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue and abdominal discomfort, and requires urgent evaluation to prevent further complications such as portal hypertension or hepatic decompensation.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of left-sided facial weakness and drooping of his mouth. He reports that he had a cold sore on his lip a few days ago, but it has since resolved. On examination, there is no vesicular rash or sensory loss, but there is complete paralysis of the left side of his face including inability to close his eye and difficulty speaking. The patient is diagnosed with Bell's palsy.

Which one of the following statements regarding Bell's palsy is true? 

A. It is caused by reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 2.
B. It can be treated with acyclovir within the first 72 hours of onset.
C. Electromyography (EMG) should be performed in all cases to confirm diagnosis.
D. Patients with Bell's palsy are at increased risk for stroke.
E. Treatment involves corticosteroids alone without antiviral therapy.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The exact cause of Bell’s palsy remains unknown, although it has been associated with viral infections such as herpes simplex virus type 1 and varicella-zoster virus. Acyclovir does not improve outcomes in patients with Bell’s palsy and should not be used routinely unless there is evidence of an active herpes infection. EMG may help distinguish between Bell’s palsy and other causes of facial nerve paralysis but is not necessary for diagnosis in most cases. There is no association between Bell’s palsy and stroke, although some symptoms may overlap initially due to involvement of cranial nerves.

Question
A 52-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of right-sided facial weakness that started two weeks ago after she experienced a severe headache on the same side followed by ear pain and hearing loss on that side as well. She denies any history of recent viral illness or trauma to her head or face. On examination, there is complete paralysis of the right side of her face including inability to close her eye and drooping of her mouth. There is also decreased sensation over the right ear.

Which one of the following conditions should be suspected? 

A. Ramsay Hunt syndrome
B. Lyme disease
C. Multiple sclerosis
D. Myasthenia gravis
E. Guillain-Barré syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient’s history and physical exam are consistent with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion leading to facial nerve palsy along with ipsilateral ear pain and vesicular rash in or around the ear canal (herpes zoster oticus). Other symptoms may include hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and taste disturbances. Lyme disease can cause facial nerve palsy but typically presents with other systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, joint pain, and erythema migrans rash. Multiple sclerosis usually presents with a relapsing-remitting pattern of neurological deficits affecting multiple sites in the central nervous system rather than isolated cranial neuropathies like Bell's palsy or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Myasthenia gravis causes muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest due to autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions while Guillain-Barré syndrome typically involves ascending motor weakness starting from lower extremities.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of left-sided facial weakness that started suddenly this morning after he woke up from sleep feeling unwell for two days prior with mild fever and headache without any respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. He denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts or animals.

Which one of the following investigations would be most appropriate? 

A. Lumbar puncture
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and internal auditory canals
C. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck
D. Blood tests for autoimmune and infectious causes
E. Referral to ophthalmology for eye examination

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient’s history is suggestive of a viral infection such as herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus causing Bell's palsy, but other possible etiologies should be considered including Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, HIV infection, syphilis, tuberculosis, leukemia, lymphoma, and metastatic cancer. Blood tests may include complete blood count with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level, glucose level, liver function tests, renal function tests, electrolytes panel, antinuclear antibodies titer, rheumatoid factor assay, anti-dsDNA antibody test if lupus is suspected based on clinical features or family history. Lumbar puncture may be indicated if there are signs of meningitis or encephalitis such as headache, fever, altered mental status or seizures. MRI with gadolinium contrast is more sensitive than CT in detecting abnormalities involving cranial nerves especially when there is no obvious cause on physical exam or laboratory testing. Ophthalmology referral may be needed if corneal exposure due to incomplete eyelid closure leads to dryness or ulceration that could affect vision.

Question
A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath, chest pain and swelling in his left leg. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking. On examination, he is tachycardic, hypotensive and has crepitations on lung auscultation. An urgent CT pulmonary angiogram confirms bilateral pulmonary emboli and a DVT in his left leg. The patient is started on therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH). However, after 24 hours of treatment, the patient's platelet count drops from baseline by more than 50%. What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Switch to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)
B. Discontinue UFH and switch to warfarin
C. Continue UFH but monitor platelet counts daily
D. Perform an immediate platelet transfusion
E. Initiate thrombolytic therapy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare complication of heparin therapy that can occur within days to weeks after initiation of treatment. It occurs due to antibodies against complexes formed between heparin and platelet factor 4 which leads to platelet activation and consumption resulting in thrombocytopenia and increased risk of thrombosis. In patients suspected of developing HIT while on UFH therapy, switching to LMWH is recommended as it has a lower risk of cross-reactivity with HIT antibodies.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis despite being compliant with long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin or LMWH over several years. She also reports multiple miscarriages in her past medical history but no other significant medical conditions or family history of thrombotic events. A thorough investigation reveals that she has a deficiency in protein S, an anticoagulant protein. What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Increase the dose of warfarin or LMWH
B. Switch to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
C. Add aspirin to her current regimen
D. Initiate lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin or LMWH
E. Refer for genetic counselling and testing

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Protein S deficiency is an inherited disorder that increases the risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients with recurrent unprovoked VTE and known protein S deficiency should be considered for long-term anticoagulation therapy with either warfarin or LMWH as they have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence by up to 90%. Aspirin alone is not recommended as it does not provide adequate protection against recurrent VTE.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with a swollen left leg and shortness of breath. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia but no previous history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). On examination, he has bilateral crepitations on lung auscultation and swelling in his left leg along with tenderness over the calf muscle. An urgent CT pulmonary angiogram confirms bilateral PE and a DVT in his left leg extending into the iliac vein. The patient is started on therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH but develops worsening respiratory distress despite supportive measures including oxygen supplementation and bronchodilators. What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Continue LMWH therapy and monitor closely
B. Switch to unfractionated heparin (UFH)
C. Initiate thrombolytic therapy
D. Perform an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement
E. Refer for surgical embolectomy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients with massive or submassive PE and hemodynamic instability, thrombolytic therapy is the preferred treatment option as it has been shown to reduce mortality and improve hemodynamics. Thrombolysis should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis and after careful consideration of the patient's bleeding risk. UFH or LMWH can be continued during thrombolysis but should be stopped if there is evidence of active bleeding.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to your clinic with a complaint of recurrent eyelid swelling and redness for the past year. She has been treated with topical antibiotics and steroids in the past, but her symptoms have not resolved completely. On examination, you notice that she has bilateral erythematous eyelids with crusting at the base of her lashes. There is also mild ptosis on the right side. The rest of the ocular exam is unremarkable.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Sebaceous gland carcinoma
B. Basal cell carcinoma
C. Rosacea keratitis
D. Atopic dermatitis
E. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP), an autoimmune disorder that affects mucous membranes including those of the eyes and mouth. It typically presents as chronic conjunctivitis or blepharitis, which can lead to scarring and destruction of tissue if left untreated.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to your clinic with a complaint of persistent itching and scaling around his eyelids for several months now. He reports using over-the-counter creams and ointments without any relief from his symptoms. On examination, there are fine scales along his upper and lower eyelid margins bilaterally, along with some crusting at the base of his lashes.

What would be your initial management plan for this patient? 

A. Topical corticosteroids 
B. Oral tetracyclines 
C. Artificial tears 
D. Warm compresses 
E. Referral to an ophthalmologist 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with anterior blepharitis, which can be caused by bacterial colonization or seborrheic dermatitis. The initial management plan for this condition is warm compresses to the affected area, followed by gentle cleansing of the eyelids with a mild soap or baby shampoo.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to your clinic with a complaint of recurrent episodes of redness and swelling around her right eye for the past year. She reports that these episodes are associated with pain and tenderness in the affected area. On examination, there is erythema and edema involving the upper and lower eyelids on the right side, along with some crusting at the base of her lashes.

What would be your next step in managing this patient? 

A. Referral to an ophthalmologist 
B. Topical antibiotics 
C. Oral antibiotics 
D. Biopsy of lesion 
E. Topical corticosteroids 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's presentation is concerning for orbital cellulitis, which can lead to serious complications if left untreated. Therefore, she should be referred urgently to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management including imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI, blood cultures, intravenous antibiotics and possible surgical intervention depending upon severity of disease process involved.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a history of vomiting and diarrhea for the past two days. He reports that he has not been able to keep any fluids down and feels extremely thirsty. On examination, he appears dehydrated with dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor. His blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate is 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and temperature is 38°C.

What type of dehydration does this patient most likely have? What are the clinical features? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Hypertonic dehydration
B. Isotonic dehydration
C. Hypotonic dehydration
D. Hypernatremic dehydration
E. Hyponatremic dehydration

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient most likely has hypernatremic (hypertonic) dehydration due to excessive fluid loss from vomiting and diarrhea leading to an increase in serum sodium levels above normal range (>145 mEq/L). Clinical features include thirst, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, sunken eyes, low urine output, dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing up, confusion or lethargy in severe cases. Management involves correcting fluid deficits by administering isotonic saline followed by hypotonic solutions such as 5% dextrose in water until serum sodium levels return to normal.

Question
A 50-year-old female presents with complaints of fatigue, headache and muscle cramps for the past few days after running a half marathon race without adequate hydration measures during the event. She reports drinking only small amounts of water throughout the run despite feeling thirsty.

What type of electrolyte imbalance could she be experiencing? What are the potential complications? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Hyponatremia
B. Hyperkalemia
C. Hypocalcemia
D. Hypernatremia
E. Hypokalemia

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient is most likely experiencing hypokalemia due to excessive sweating and inadequate fluid intake leading to a decrease in serum potassium levels below normal range (<3.5 mEq/L). Potential complications include muscle weakness, cramps, arrhythmias, respiratory failure or paralysis in severe cases. Management involves correcting the underlying cause by administering oral or intravenous potassium supplements along with adequate hydration measures.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents with complaints of thirst, dry mouth and fatigue for the past few days after working outdoors in hot weather without taking any breaks for water intake. On examination, he appears dehydrated with decreased skin turgor and dry mucous membranes.

What type of dehydration does this patient most likely have? What are the clinical features? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Isotonic dehydration
B. Hypertonic dehydration
C. Hypotonic dehydration
D. Hyperkalemic dehydration
E. Hyponatremic dehydration

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient most likely has isotonic (extracellular volume depletion) dehydration due to excessive fluid loss from sweating leading to an equal loss of electrolytes and water from the body resulting in no change in serum sodium levels but a decrease in extracellular fluid volume causing decreased tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if left untreated. Clinical features include thirst, dry mouth, decreased urine output, dizziness upon standing up, confusion or lethargy in severe cases. Management involves correcting fluid deficits by administering isotonic saline followed by monitoring electrolyte levels and addressing any underlying causes such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of recurrent episodes of vertigo and dizziness over the past few months. She reports that these symptoms are triggered by changes in head position, especially when she turns her head or looks up. The patient also complains of nausea and vomiting during these attacks.

On examination, the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre is performed, which elicits rotatory nystagmus with a latency period of less than 5 seconds. The doctor suspects benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) but wants to confirm the diagnosis using additional tests.

Which of the following tests would be most appropriate for confirming BPPV in this patient? 

A. Head impulse test
B. Caloric testing
C. Video-nystagmography 
D. Supine roll test
E. Dynamic visual acuity test

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: While the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre can help diagnose BPPV, it may not always be reliable in some cases. Additional tests such as video-nystagmography (VNG) can provide more accurate information about eye movements during positional changes and help identify specific types of BPPV affecting different semicircular canals.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of dizziness and unsteadiness while walking over the past few weeks. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus, all well-controlled on medications.

On examination, there is no evidence of any neurological deficits or hearing loss. However, he experiences vertigo upon performing the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre on both sides.

What is the most likely cause of his symptoms? 

A. Vestibular neuritis
B. Meniere's disease
C. Labyrinthitis 
D. Acoustic neuroma 
E. Bilateral benign paroxysmal positional vertigo

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: While BPPV is typically unilateral, bilateral involvement can occur in some cases. This may be more common in older patients or those with other comorbidities such as diabetes. The Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre can help diagnose this condition and differentiate it from other causes of dizziness.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of recurrent episodes of vertigo over the past few months. She reports that these symptoms are triggered by sudden head movements or changes in position, especially when she lies down or gets up from bed.

On examination, there is no evidence of any neurological deficits or hearing loss. However, the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre elicits rotatory nystagmus on both sides with a latency period of less than 10 seconds.

What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient? 

A. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy
B. Canalith repositioning manoeuvres 
C. Betahistine hydrochloride 
D. Intratympanic gentamicin injection 
E. Surgical intervention

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Canalith repositioning manoeuvres (CRM) such as the Epley manoeuvre or Semont-Liberatory technique are highly effective treatments for BPPV and involve moving displaced otoliths back into their normal position within the semicircular canals using specific head movements. These techniques have been shown to provide rapid relief of symptoms and prevent recurrences in most patients with BPPV.

Question
A 72-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. She has been on antibiotics for two days and her fever has resolved. However, she appears more confused than usual and is agitated at times. Her oxygen saturation levels are stable but she complains of shortness of breath when walking to the bathroom. On examination, you note that she has dry mucous membranes and her urine output is low despite adequate fluid intake.
Which one of the following electrolyte imbalances could be contributing to this patient's delirium? 

A. Hypernatremia
B. Hypokalemia
C. Hypermagnesemia
D. Hypocalcemia
E. Hypercalcemia

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Hypokalemia can cause confusion, agitation, and weakness in patients with COPD who are receiving diuretics or have poor oral intake due to dyspnea from pneumonia.

Question
An 80-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute onset confusion and disorientation after falling down the stairs at home. He was previously independent in his activities of daily living but now requires assistance with basic tasks such as dressing himself and using the toilet. His family reports that he has been experiencing memory loss for several months prior to this incident but had not sought medical attention until now.
Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most helpful in identifying any structural abnormalities that may be causing this patient's delirium? 

A. Computed tomography (CT) scan
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
C. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
D. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan
E. X-ray

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: MRI is superior to CT in detecting subtle changes in brain structure and is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating cognitive impairment in older adults.

Question
A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression presents to her primary care physician with complaints of forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating over the past few weeks. She denies any recent illnesses or changes in medication regimen. On examination, she appears alert but has difficulty recalling three unrelated words after five minutes despite repeated attempts.
Which one of the following medications should be avoided in this patient due to its potential to cause delirium? 

A. Citalopram
B. Escitalopram
C. Fluoxetine
D. Sertraline
E. Venlafaxine

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Venlafaxine can cause confusion, agitation, and hallucinations in elderly patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment or dementia due to its serotonergic effects on the central nervous system.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his GP with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He has a history of hypertension and is currently taking multiple medications for it. His International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is calculated, and he scores 20 points. The GP decides to start him on alpha-blockers as the first-line treatment.
Which one of the following alpha-blockers should be used? Consider the patient's comorbidities.

A. Doxazosin
B. Tamsulosin
C. Alfuzosin
D. Terazosin
E. Silodosin

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In patients with BPH who have concomitant hypertension, terazosin may be preferred over other alpha-blockers due to its antihypertensive properties.

Question
A 75-year-old man presents with acute urinary retention secondary to BPH and requires catheterisation in hospital. After initial management, he is scheduled for transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). However, preoperative assessment reveals that he has an elevated serum creatinine level and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
What would be the most appropriate course of action? 

A. Proceed with TURP as planned
B. Delay surgery until renal function improves
C. Perform open prostatectomy instead of TURP 
D. Start medical therapy for BPH 
E. Refer the patient for dialysis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Surgery should be delayed until renal function improves or stabilises to minimise postoperative complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance.

Question
A 68-year-old man presents with LUTS suggestive of BPH but also reports erectile dysfunction (ED). He denies any history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. He is currently taking no medications.
What would be the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Start tadalafil
B. Start sildenafil 
C. Refer for penile prosthesis surgery 
D. Perform urodynamic studies
E. Offer watchful waiting

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE-5i), can improve both LUTS and ED in patients with BPH without significant cardiovascular side effects compared to other PDE-5is such as sildenafil.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In cases of chronic blepharitis where other underlying causes have been ruled out, meibography may be useful in identifying structural abnormalities within the meibomian glands that contribute to MGD and ocular surface disease. This non-invasive imaging technique can help guide treatment decisions and monitor response to therapy over time.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of excessive thirst and frequent urination for the past few months. She has no significant medical history, but she is currently taking lithium for bipolar disorder. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for mild dehydration. Laboratory investigations reveal low urine osmolality and high serum sodium levels. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Cranial diabetes insipidus
B. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
C. Primary polydipsia
D. Drug-induced diuresis 
E. Diabetes mellitus

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with diabetes insipidus (DI), which can be caused by either deficient secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or resistance to its action in the kidneys. Lithium is a known cause of nephrogenic DI, which results from impaired responsiveness of the renal tubules to ADH due to medication-induced downregulation of aquaporin channels. Other causes of nephrogenic DI include genetic mutations, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypercalcemia or hypokalemia.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to his endocrinologist with a history of recurrent episodes of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and confusion over the past year. He reports that these episodes usually occur after strenuous exercise or exposure to hot weather and resolve spontaneously within a few hours without any specific treatment. His physical examination is normal except for mild dehydration and tachycardia during an episode. Laboratory tests show low urine osmolality and high serum sodium levels during an episode but are otherwise normal.

Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be most helpful in establishing the underlying cause? 

A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain
B. Water deprivation test 
C. Serum vasopressin level measurement 
D. Genetic testing for aquaporin-2 mutations
E. Urine electrolyte analysis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest that he may have syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is characterized by excessive release of ADH from the pituitary gland in the absence of physiological stimuli such as dehydration or hypovolemia. SIADH can be caused by a variety of conditions, including malignancies, pulmonary disorders, medications, and central nervous system disorders such as head trauma or infections. Measurement of serum vasopressin levels during an episode can help differentiate between SIADH and other causes of hyponatremia.

Question
A 6-year-old boy presents to his paediatrician with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and bedwetting since infancy. His parents report that he drinks large amounts of water throughout the day and night but still complains of thirst. He has no significant medical history except for mild developmental delay and constipation. Physical examination reveals normal growth parameters, blood pressure, and neurological function but no signs of dehydration or edema.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing the diagnosis? 

A. Renal ultrasound scan
B. Water deprivation test 
C. Serum creatinine level measurement 
D. Genetic testing for arginine vasopressin receptor mutations
E. Urine culture and sensitivity testing

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with nephrogenic DI, which results from impaired responsiveness of the renal tubules to ADH due to genetic mutations affecting either the V2 receptor or aquaporin channels in the collecting ducts. Nephrogenic DI can present with recurrent urinary tract infections, enuresis, failure to thrive, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypernatremia or hypokalemia. Genetic testing can help identify the underlying mutation and guide management, which may include thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or high-dose desmopressin in selected cases.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient has early-stage diabetic nephropathy characterized by microalbuminuria, which is associated with increased risk of progressive kidney disease and cardiovascular events even in the absence of overt hypertension or declining eGFR. Blood pressure control with renin-angiotensin system blockade (e.g., ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers) has been shown to reduce albumin excretion rate and delay onset of end-stage renal disease in patients with diabetes. Tight glycemic control is also important for preventing microvascular complications, but may not be as effective in reducing albuminuria once it has developed.

Question
A 65-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the clinic with complaints of numbness and tingling in his feet for the past year. He reports difficulty walking due to balance issues and occasional falls. On examination, you note decreased sensation to light touch, vibration, and temperature in a stocking distribution up to mid-calf level bilaterally. You also observe muscle wasting in the feet and ankles.

Which of the following is most likely responsible for these findings?

A. Diabetic neuropathy
B. Multiple sclerosis
C. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
D. Guillain-Barre syndrome
E. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with diabetic neuropathy, which commonly affects sensory nerves first leading to numbness and tingling sensations in a stocking distribution pattern that progresses proximally over time. However, the presence of muscle wasting suggests chronic denervation and reinnervation indicating an underlying hereditary peripheral neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

Question
A 52-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus presents with severe burning pain in both feet that worsens at night interfering with her sleep for several months now despite adequate glycemic control on insulin therapy. She has tried various analgesics but none have provided relief from her symptoms.

What is the best next step in management? 

A. Refer for nerve conduction studies 
B. Prescribe gabapentin 
C. Prescribe amitriptyline 
D. Prescribe tramadol 
E. Refer for spinal cord stimulation 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), which can be managed by pharmacological agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin as first-line treatments according to NICE guidelines.

Question
A 60-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe pain and weakness in his right leg that started while walking. He reports no history of trauma or previous similar episodes. On examination, you note absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses on the right side compared to normal pulses on the left side.

Which of the following is most likely responsible for these findings? 

A. Diabetic neuropathy 
B. Acute arterial occlusion 
C. Chronic venous insufficiency 
D. Deep vein thrombosis 
E. Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of acute limb ischemia due to an embolus or thrombus blocking blood flow to the lower extremity resulting in sudden onset pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesias, paralysis, and poikilothermia (coolness). Absent peripheral pulses indicate significant vascular compromise requiring urgent intervention such as embolectomy or thrombectomy to restore perfusion and prevent irreversible tissue damage.

Question
A new screening test for a rare genetic disease is being developed. The prevalence of the disease in the general population is 1 in 10,000. The sensitivity and specificity of the screening test are both 95%. If the screening test is positive, what is the probability that the individual actually has the disease? 

A. 0.0095
B. 0.0475
C. 0.3322
D. 0.9524
E. 0.9999

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem:
P(Disease|Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) x P(Disease) / [P(Positive|Disease) x P(Disease) + P(Positive|No Disease) x P(No Disease)]
= (0.95 x 0.0001) / [(0.95 x 0.0001) + (0.05 x 0.9999)] 
= 0.3322.

Question

C.Conduct door-to-door screenings for hypertension 
D.Train local healthcare workers to conduct screenings 
E.Establish referral pathways for those diagnosed with hypertension 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Offering educational sessions on healthy lifestyle choices would be most appropriate as an initial step because it will help raise awareness about hypertension and its risk factors while also promoting prevention through lifestyle modifications such as exercise and diet changes.

Question
A national breast cancer screening program uses mammography to detect early-stage breast cancer in women aged between 50-70 years old.
Which one of the following is a potential harm associated with mammography? 

A. False-negative results
B. Increased anxiety and stress for patients 
C. Overdiagnosis of non-life-threatening cancers 
D. Radiation exposure leading to cancer 
E. Invasive procedures required for diagnosis

A. Intravenous fluids only
B. Oral antibiotics
C. Sigmoidoscopy 
D. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
E. Laparoscopic sigmoid resection

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with complicated diverticulitis, which requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications such as perforation or abscess formation. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is recommended as it can help identify the extent of inflammation, presence of abscesses or free air indicating perforation.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to his GP with recurrent episodes of constipation alternating with diarrhoea over several months, along with mild abdominal discomfort and bloating after meals. He denies any rectal bleeding or weight loss but reports feeling fatigued lately.
Which investigation would be most useful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Colonoscopy 
B. Stool culture for pathogens 
C. Abdominal X-ray 
D. Fecal occult blood test 
E. Barium enema

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits without evidence of organic disease on routine diagnostic tests such as colonoscopy.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of intermittent crampy abdominal pain mainly in the lower left quadrant, bloating and flatulence. He has a history of diverticular disease diagnosed on colonoscopy two years ago but has not had any episodes of diverticulitis.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: A high-fiber diet is recommended in patients with diverticular disease to prevent complications such as diverticulitis or bleeding by promoting regular bowel movements and reducing intraluminal pressure within the colon.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her obstetrician for antenatal care at 12 weeks gestation. She has a family history of Down's syndrome, with her sister having the condition. The patient is concerned about the risk of her baby developing Down's syndrome and requests further testing. Which of the following tests would be most appropriate in this situation? 

A. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) 
B. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
C. Amniocentesis
D. Fetal ultrasound
E. Maternal serum screening

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Given the patient's age and family history, she is at increased risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome. While NIPT and maternal serum screening are less invasive options, they may not provide as accurate results as CVS or amniocentesis. Fetal ultrasound can detect some physical markers associated with Down's syndrome but cannot confirm a diagnosis definitively.

Question
A 2-month-old male infant presents to his pediatrician for a routine check-up. His mother reports that he was born at term without any complications during pregnancy or delivery, but expresses concern about his development compared to her other children who did not have Down's syndrome. On examination, the infant has hypotonia and poor head control, as well as flattened facial features and upward slanting eyes consistent with Down's syndrome.
Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Referral to early intervention services 
B. Genetic counseling for parents 
C. Hearing evaluation 
D. Ophthalmology consultation 
E. Speech therapy assessment

Correct Answer: A

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient presents with severe respiratory depression due to benzodiazepine overdose, which requires immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration of her condition. The most appropriate management would be intubation to secure airway patency and provide mechanical ventilation until drug effects have worn off. Administration of flumazenil may precipitate seizures or arrhythmias and should not be used routinely in patients with benzodiazepine overdose unless there are specific indications such as coma or respiratory failure that cannot be managed by other means.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to her GP with concerns about her eating habits. She reports that she has been restricting her food intake for the past year, and has lost a significant amount of weight as a result. She denies any binge-eating or purging behaviours, but admits to feeling guilty when she eats more than what she considers to be an acceptable amount of food. On examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but she has a BMI of 16.5 kg/m2. The GP notes that the patient appears emaciated and has lanugo hair on her face and arms.
Which of the following is not a typical feature of anorexia nervosa? 

A. Amenorrhoea
B. Hypotension
C. Bradycardia
D. Osteoporosis
E. Hypercholesterolemia

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Anorexia nervosa is characterized by severe restriction of food intake leading to significantly low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, and disturbance in one's perception of their own body shape or size. Typical features include amenorrhoea (in females), hypotension, bradycardia, osteoporosis, and hypercholesterolemia.

Question
A 20-year-old male presents to his GP with concerns about his eating habits over the past few months. He reports that he frequently consumes large amounts of food in short periods of time, followed by self-induced vomiting or laxative use to prevent weight gain. He also admits to engaging in excessive exercise routines to burn off calories consumed during binges. On examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits and he has a BMI of 23 kg/m2.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Anorexia nervosa 
B. Bulimia nervosa 
C. Binge eating disorder 
D. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
E. Pica

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviours, such as self-induced vomiting or laxative use, to prevent weight gain. Patients with bulimia nervosa typically have a normal body weight and may engage in excessive exercise routines to burn off calories consumed during binges.

Question
A 16-year-old female presents to her GP with concerns about her recent weight loss. She reports that she has been restricting her food intake for the past few months, and has lost a significant amount of weight as a result. She denies any binge-eating or purging behaviours, but admits to feeling guilty when she eats more than what she considers to be an acceptable amount of food. On examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but she has a BMI of 15 kg/m2.
Which of the following is not a typical feature of anorexia nervosa? 

A. Lanugo hair on face and arms
B. Amenorrhoea (in females)
C. Hypotension
D. Hyperkalemia
E. Bradycardia

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Anorexia nervosa is characterized by severe restriction of food intake leading to significantly low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, and disturbance in one's perception of their own body shape or size. Typical features include lanugo hair on face and arms, amenorrhoea (in females), hypotension, hyperkalemia, and bradycardia.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She reports a history of infertility and underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, resulting in a positive pregnancy test two weeks ago. On examination, she appears pale and tachycardic, with diffuse abdominal tenderness on palpation. An ultrasound scan reveals an ectopic pregnancy located in the interstitial portion of the left fallopian tube. 

Which of the following is true regarding interstitial ectopic pregnancies? 

A. They are more likely to rupture than other types of ectopic pregnancies.
B. They have a higher risk of causing tubal damage compared to other types of ectopic pregnancies.
C. They can be safely managed with medical therapy alone.
D. They are associated with a lower incidence of heterotopic pregnancy compared to other types of ectopic pregnancies.
E. They are commonly diagnosed at an earlier gestational age compared to other types of ectopic pregnancies.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Interstitial ectopic pregnancies occur when implantation occurs within the proximal segment of the fallopian tube that traverses through the uterine musculature before opening into the endometrial cavity. This type of ectopic pregnancy has a higher risk for tubal rupture due to its location within thick myometrium leading to delayed diagnosis and increased morbidity rates if not detected early enough or treated promptly by surgical intervention such as cornual resection or salpingectomy.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of persistent pelvic pain and irregular vaginal bleeding over several weeks duration since her last menstrual period which was approximately six weeks ago. She also reports feeling dizzy and lightheaded recently but denies any fever or vomiting episodes. Her urine pregnancy test is positive, and serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level is 3,500 IU/L. An ultrasound scan reveals a complex adnexal mass with fluid in the cul-de-sac and no intrauterine gestational sac.

Which of the following is true regarding heterotopic pregnancies? 

A. They are more common in women who have undergone fertility treatments such as IVF.
B. They always present with symptoms of acute abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding.
C. The incidence rate is similar to that of ectopic pregnancies alone.
D. Diagnosis can be made solely based on clinical examination findings without imaging studies.
E. Management typically involves expectant management or medical therapy alone.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Heterotopic pregnancy refers to the coexistence of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) and an ectopic pregnancy (EP). It occurs more commonly in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), particularly after IVF treatment where multiple embryos may be transferred into the uterus increasing the likelihood of implantation at different sites including fallopian tubes leading to higher rates of EPs compared to spontaneous conceptions which account for only 1-2% of all cases.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe right-sided abdominal pain radiating to her shoulder, nausea, and vomiting episodes over several hours duration. She reports missing her last menstrual period approximately six weeks ago but denies any history of infertility or previous pelvic surgeries. On examination, she appears pale and tachycardic, with rebound tenderness on palpation over the right iliac fossa region. An ultrasound scan reveals free fluid within the pelvis and a ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy located in the fimbrial end of the right fallopian tube.

Which of the following is true regarding laparoscopic salpingectomy? 

A. It is contraindicated in patients with unstable vital signs due to active bleeding from ruptured ectopic pregnancy.
B. It is associated with a higher risk of tubal damage compared to laparoscopic salpingostomy.
C. It is the preferred surgical approach in patients who desire future fertility preservation.
D. It has a lower success rate in achieving complete removal of ectopic pregnancy tissue compared to medical therapy alone.
E. It requires general anesthesia and longer hospital stay compared to other treatment options.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Laparoscopic salpingectomy involves the complete removal of the affected fallopian tube containing the ectopic pregnancy, while laparoscopic salpingostomy involves making an incision into the fallopian tube to remove the gestational sac and preserve tubal function for future fertility potential. The choice between these two procedures depends on several factors including patient age, presence of bilateral tubal disease or previous pelvic surgeries, size and location of ectopic pregnancy, and patient preference regarding future childbearing plans.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a fever, headache, and confusion for the past 3 days. He has no significant medical history but recently returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. On examination, he is disoriented and has neck stiffness.

MRI of the brain shows bilateral temporal lobe involvement with hemorrhagic lesions.

What is the most likely cause of encephalitis in this patient? 

A. Herpes simplex virus
B. Japanese encephalitis virus
C. West Nile virus
D. Varicella-zoster virus
E. Epstein-Barr virus

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation, travel history, laboratory findings, and imaging suggest Japanese encephalitis as the most likely cause of encephalitis in this patient.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a headache, fever, and altered mental status for the past week. She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus but is otherwise healthy. On examination, she is lethargic and confused with nuchal rigidity but no focal neurological deficits are noted. CT scan of the head shows diffuse cerebral edema without any evidence of intracranial bleeding or mass effect.

What is the next best step in management? 

A. Administer acyclovir 
B. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics 
C. Start corticosteroids 
D. Perform lumbar puncture 
E. Transfer to intensive care unit for supportive care

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of nuchal rigidity suggests meningeal irritation; therefore, lumbar puncture should be performed to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and culture.

Question
A 40-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a seizure, fever, and headache for the past day. He has no significant medical history but reports recent travel to Africa. On examination, he is febrile with neck stiffness but no focal neurological deficits are noted. CT scan of the head shows diffuse cerebral edema without any evidence of intracranial bleeding or mass effect. Lumbar puncture reveals elevated protein levels and lymphocytic pleocytosis.

What is the most likely cause of encephalitis in this patient? 

A. Herpes simplex virus 
B. Listeria monocytogenes 
C. Plasmodium falciparum 
D. Mycobacterium tuberculosis
E. Cryptococcus neoformans

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation, travel history, laboratory findings, and imaging suggest cerebral malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum as the most likely cause of encephalitis in this patient.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents with postmenopausal bleeding and is diagnosed with endometrial cancer. She undergoes a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. During follow-up visits, she complains of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Which of the following options would be most appropriate for managing her symptoms? 

A. Topical estrogen cream
B. Vaginal dilators
C. Systemic hormone replacement therapy
D. Pelvic floor muscle exercises
E. Cognitive-behavioral therapy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Topical estrogen creams are effective in treating vaginal dryness and dyspareunia in women who have undergone surgical menopause or have low levels of circulating estrogen due to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with abnormal uterine bleeding and an ultrasound shows thickening of the endometrium. She undergoes a Pipelle biopsy which reveals atypical hyperplasia without evidence of invasion on histology examination. What is the recommended management? 

A. Observation only
B. Progestin therapy
C. Hysterectomy
D. Radiation therapy
E. Chemotherapy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Atypical hyperplasia carries a significant risk (up to 30%) of progression to endometrial carcinoma, therefore hysterectomy is recommended as definitive treatment.

Question
A 70-year-old woman presents with advanced-stage endometrial cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and liver.She has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoporosis.She expresses concerns about quality-of-life issues during treatment.Which one of the following treatments would be most appropriate? 

A.Chemotherapy 
B.Radiation Therapy 
C.Palliative care 
D.Surgery 
E.Hormone therapy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Palliative care is the most appropriate treatment option in this case, as it focuses on improving quality of life and managing symptoms rather than attempting to cure the cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be considered for palliation of symptoms, but are unlikely to provide a significant survival benefit. Surgery is not recommended due to the advanced stage of disease and multiple comorbidities. Hormone therapy is not effective in treating metastatic endometrial cancer.

Question
A 36-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, and dyspareunia. She has been trying to conceive for the past year without success. Her menstrual cycle is regular, lasting for five days with moderate flow. On examination, there is tenderness on palpation of the posterior vaginal fornix and a fixed retroverted uterus.

Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis? 

A. Transvaginal ultrasound
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
C. Hysterosalpingography
D. Computed tomography (CT) scan
E. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: MRI is considered the gold standard in diagnosing endometriosis due to its high sensitivity and specificity in detecting deep infiltrating lesions and extrapelvic disease involvement.

Question
A 29-year-old nulliparous woman presents with severe dysmenorrhea that has not responded to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). She also reports heavy menstrual bleeding, intermenstrual spotting, and dyspareunia during menstruation.

On examination, there are no palpable masses or nodules but there is diffuse tenderness on bimanual examination.

What would be the next best step in management? 

A. Referral for laparoscopy 
B. Prescribe hormonal contraceptives 
C. Offer reassurance and analgesics 
D. Order transvaginal ultrasound 
E. Perform hysteroscopy 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Transvaginal ultrasound can help identify ovarian endometriomas as well as other gynecologic pathology such as adenomyosis or fibroids which may present similarly to endometriosis.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents with acute onset of severe lower abdominal pain and vomiting. She has a history of endometriosis and is currently on the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP). On examination, there is diffuse tenderness in the lower abdomen with rebound tenderness.

Which one of the following complications should be suspected? 

A. Ovarian torsion 
B. Appendicitis
C. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
D. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy 
E. Bowel obstruction

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Ovarian torsion can occur in women with ovarian endometriomas due to adhesions or fibrosis that cause twisting of the ovary leading to ischemia and infarction. It presents as acute onset of severe pelvic pain, nausea, and vomiting which may mimic other surgical emergencies such as appendicitis or PID.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his left testicle that has been worsening over the past two days. He reports a history of unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the last month. On examination, there is tenderness and swelling of the left epididymis and testis, which are also warm to touch. The patient's temperature is 38°C, and he appears unwell.

Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? 

A. Treponema pallidum
B. Haemophilus influenzae
C. Streptococcus pyogenes
D. Neisseria meningitidis
E. Escherichia coli

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation of acute epididymitis or orchitis includes sudden onset of scrotal pain, swelling, erythema, and warmth accompanied by fever and malaise. In sexually active men under 35 years old, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causative agents; however, in older men or those who have had urinary tract instrumentation or catheterization, Escherichia coli is more commonly implicated.

Question
A 22-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of right-sided scrotal pain that started suddenly while playing football earlier today. The pain has become progressively worse since then despite analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. There is no history of trauma or previous episodes of similar pain.

On examination, there is significant tenderness on palpation of the right testis compared to the left side but no swelling or erythema noted in either testis or epididymis.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Epididymo-orchitis 
B. Testicular torsion 
C. Testicular cancer 
D. Epididymitis 
E. Varicocele 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation of testicular torsion includes sudden onset of severe unilateral scrotal pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. There may be a history of previous episodes of intermittent testicular pain or swelling, but this is not always present. On examination, the affected testis will be tender to palpation and higher in the scrotum than the unaffected side.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a two-day history of left-sided scrotal pain that has been gradually worsening. He reports no dysuria or urethral discharge but has had occasional urinary frequency over the past few weeks. He denies any recent sexual activity or travel history.

On examination, there is tenderness and swelling noted on the left epididymis compared to the right side; however, there is no significant tenderness or swelling noted in either testis.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Epididymo-orchitis
B. Testicular torsion 
C. Epididymitis 
D. Testicular cancer 
E. Hydrocele 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Epididymitis refers to inflammation of the epididymis, which can occur due to infection (most commonly caused by bacteria such as Escherichia coli) or non-infectious causes such as trauma or autoimmune disorders. It typically presents with gradual onset of unilateral scrotal pain and swelling localized to the epididymis rather than involving both testes equally as seen in orchitis or epididymo-orchitis.

Question
A 6-year-old boy presents to the Emergency Department with a high fever, drooling and difficulty swallowing. On examination, he has stridor and appears toxic. The medical team suspects acute epiglottitis. What is the most appropriate initial management? Should the patient be intubated immediately? What are the potential complications of intubation in this case? 

A. Intubate immediately
B. Administer intravenous antibiotics and corticosteroids
C. Perform an emergency tracheostomy 
D. Obtain imaging studies before deciding on further management 
E. Start nebulized adrenaline therapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The initial management for suspected acute epiglottitis should include administering intravenous antibiotics (such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) and corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone). Intubation should only be considered if there is evidence of respiratory distress or impending airway obstruction, but it carries a risk of inducing complete airway obstruction due to laryngospasm or swelling of the upper airway structures during instrumentation. Emergency tracheostomy may be necessary if intubation fails or is contraindicated, but it also carries risks such as bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, and damage to adjacent structures.

Question
A 4-year-old girl presents to her GP with a history of sore throat, fever and dysphagia for two days. She has no significant past medical history and is fully vaccinated according to schedule.
On examination she appears unwell with a temperature of 38°C and inspiratory stridor at rest without any signs of respiratory distress.
What investigations would you perform? What other differential diagnoses would you consider? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Perform blood cultures and chest X-ray; consider foreign body aspiration or retropharyngeal abscess; refer to ENT specialist for direct laryngoscopy and biopsy 
B. Perform throat swab and rapid antigen test for group A streptococcus; consider croup or bronchiolitis; prescribe oral antibiotics and supportive care at home
C. Perform nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viruses; consider epiglottitis or peritonsillar abscess; admit to hospital for intravenous antibiotics, corticosteroids, and airway monitoring
D. Perform ultrasound of the neck and chest CT scan with contrast; consider angioedema or anaphylaxis; administer adrenaline, antihistamines, and steroids immediately 
E. Perform MRI of the brainstem and spinal cord; consider Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis; consult neurologist for further management 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The most appropriate investigations in this case would be a nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viruses (such as influenza or parainfluenza), blood cultures, and lateral neck X-ray (to look for signs of soft tissue swelling). Other differential diagnoses that should be considered include croup, retropharyngeal abscess, peritonsillar abscess, foreign body aspiration, angioedema, anaphylaxis, and bacterial tracheitis. Management should involve admitting the patient to hospital for close observation, intravenous antibiotics (such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) and corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone), humidified oxygen therapy if needed, and airway monitoring.

Question
An 8-year-old boy presents to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of high fever (39°C), severe sore throat, drooling and difficulty breathing. On examination he has stridor at rest without any signs of respiratory distress.
What is the most likely diagnosis? What are the potential complications of this condition? How would you manage this patient? 

A. Acute epiglottitis; airway obstruction, sepsis, meningitis; administer intravenous antibiotics and corticosteroids, consider intubation or tracheostomy if necessary 
B. Croup; dehydration, hypoxia, respiratory failure; administer nebulized adrenaline and steroids, provide supportive care at home 
C. Peritonsillar abscess; airway obstruction, sepsis, mediastinitis; perform incision and drainage under general anesthesia, prescribe oral antibiotics 
D. Bacterial tracheitis; airway obstruction, sepsis, pneumonia; administer intravenous antibiotics and humidified oxygen therapy with close monitoring in ICU
E. Retropharyngeal abscess; airway obstruction, sepsis, spinal cord compression; perform surgical drainage under general anesthesia with antibiotic coverage

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in this case is acute epiglottitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) or other bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus. Potential complications of this condition include complete airway obstruction due to rapid progression of edema or inflammation of the epiglottis and surrounding structures (such as arytenoids), septicemia leading to shock or multiorgan failure, meningitis or brain abscess due to hematogenous spread of bacteria from the upper respiratory tract.
Management should involve administering intravenous antibiotics (such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) and corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone) immediately after obtaining blood cultures and securing the airway if needed (intubation or tracheostomy). Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation is crucial, and the patient should be admitted to ICU for further management.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to his General Practitioner (GP) with a history of hypertension for the past 10 years, which has been difficult to control despite multiple medications. He also reports experiencing headaches and visual disturbances over the past few months. On examination, he is found to have papilloedema and an enlarged left kidney on palpation. Blood tests reveal elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels. An abdominal CT scan shows a large mass in the left adrenal gland.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Renal artery stenosis
B. Phaeochromocytoma
C. Cushing's syndrome
D. Primary hyperaldosteronism
E. Coarctation of the aorta

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with phaeochromocytoma, which can cause severe hypertension that is often resistant to treatment with multiple medications. Headaches and visual disturbances may be due to increased intracranial pressure from malignant hypertension or cerebral haemorrhage caused by uncontrolled blood pressure elevation. Papilloedema may also indicate raised intracranial pressure secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy or cerebral oedema.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a history of poorly controlled hypertension for several years despite taking multiple antihypertensive medications including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. She has no significant medical history except for osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium tablets once weekly for five years.
On examination, her blood pressure is 170/100 mmHg in both arms, but there are no other abnormal findings.
Which medication could be contributing to her refractory hypertension? 

A. Alendronate sodium tablets 
B. Aspirin 
C. Simvastatin 
D. Metformin 
E. Paracetamol 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Alendronate sodium tablets are a type of bisphosphonate used to treat osteoporosis by inhibiting bone resorption. However, they can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as oesophageal irritation and ulceration, which may lead to poor absorption of antihypertensive medications taken orally. This can result in refractory hypertension despite treatment with multiple drugs.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with a history of hypertension for the past five years that has been difficult to control despite taking several antihypertensive medications including angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. He also reports experiencing episodes of palpitations, sweating, and headaches over the past few months.
On examination, his blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg in both arms, but there are no other abnormal findings.
Which investigation would be most appropriate? 

A. Adrenal venous sampling
B. MRI pituitary
C. MR angiography of the renal arteries
D. Overnight dexamethasone suppression test
E. Short Synacthen test

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests secondary hypertension due to renovascular disease or renal artery stenosis (RAS). MR angiography of the renal arteries is a non-invasive imaging modality that can detect RAS accurately and guide further management options such as percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) or surgical revascularisation if indicated. Other investigations such as adrenal venous sampling or hormonal assays may be considered if primary hyperaldosteronism or phaeochromocytoma is suspected based on clinical features and biochemical abnormalities.

Question
A 42-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain and pressure symptoms. She reports that her periods have become increasingly heavy over the past year, and she has noticed an increase in abdominal girth despite no significant weight gain. On examination, there is a palpable mass extending above the umbilicus. Pelvic ultrasound reveals multiple uterine fibroids measuring up to 10 cm in diameter. The patient wishes to preserve her fertility but is concerned about the size of the fibroids and their impact on her quality of life.

Which one of the following treatments would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Hysterectomy
B. Myomectomy
C. Uterine artery embolisation
D. GnRH agonist therapy
E. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In this case, given the large size and number of fibroids, uterine artery embolisation may be considered as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery. This procedure involves blocking blood flow to the fibroids via catheterization of the uterine arteries, leading to subsequent shrinkage and symptom relief.

Question
A 30-year-old nulliparous woman presents with a history of infertility and dysmenorrhoea for several years. She has undergone previous investigations including hysteroscopy which revealed a submucosal fibroid measuring 2 cm in diameter within the endometrial cavity.

This involves surgical resection of the fibroids while preserving the uterus via laparoscopy or open surgery under general anaesthesia.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of widespread pain, fatigue and sleep disturbances for the past 6 months. She reports that she has been experiencing headaches, irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and bladder problems as well. Physical examination reveals multiple tender points in all four quadrants of the body. Blood tests including FBC, ESR, CRP, TFTs, LFTs, ANA, RF and HIV antibodies are normal. The patient is diagnosed with fibromyalgia.
Which of the following medications would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Gabapentin
B. Amitriptyline
C. Pregabalin
D. Duloxetine 
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Although all options may be used in treating fibromyalgia, duloxetine is recommended as first-line therapy due to its dual action on both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to his GP with a complaint of chronic pain in his muscles and joints along with fatigue and poor concentration for the last two years which have affected his daily activities significantly. He also complains of frequent headaches and difficulty sleeping at night despite feeling exhausted during daytime hours.
Physical examination is unremarkable except for diffuse tenderness over several muscle groups upon palpation.
Which one of the following diagnostic criteria should be met to diagnose fibromyalgia? 

A. Tender point count >11 out of 18
B. Pain duration >3 months
C. Widespread pain index (WPI) score ≥7 AND symptom severity scale (SSS) score ≥5 OR WPI score between 3-6 AND SSS score ≥9 
D. Presence of trigger points on physical examination 
E. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as ESR or CRP

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The 2016 revised diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia require the presence of both WPI and SSS scores. A diagnosis can be made if either the WPI score is ≥7 and the SSS score is ≥5, or the WPI score is between 3-6 and the SSS score is ≥9.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents to her GP with a history of chronic pain in multiple sites along with fatigue, sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties for several years. She reports that she has tried various medications including NSAIDs, opioids and antidepressants but none have provided significant relief.

A multimodal approach involving a combination of these therapies may be more effective than any single intervention alone.

Question
A 60-year-old male patient presented with a history of progressive dyspnoea and dry cough for the past year. He had a history of working in an asbestos factory for over 20 years. On examination, he had bilateral fine inspiratory crackles throughout both lungs. His chest X-ray showed reticular opacities predominantly in the lower zones, and his high-resolution CT scan confirmed interstitial thickening with honeycombing in the lower lobes.

Which one of the following is true regarding this patient's condition? 

A. The most likely diagnosis is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
B. This patient has asbestosis-induced lung disease 
C. The presence of honeycombing on HRCT rules out other possible diagnoses
D. Lung biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis in this case
E. Treatment options are limited and mainly supportive

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation, occupational history, radiological findings and exposure to asbestos suggest that this patient has asbestosis-induced lung disease rather than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or any other cause of interstitial lung disease (ILD). Honeycombing on HRCT is suggestive but not diagnostic of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which can be seen in both IPF and asbestosis-related ILD. However, surgical lung biopsy may be required to differentiate between these two conditions if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis.

Question
A 45-year-old female non-smoker presented with exertional dyspnoea and dry cough for six months duration. She also reported fatigue, weight loss, joint pains and skin rash on her face and hands for several weeks before onset of respiratory symptoms. Her physical examination was significant for bibasilar fine inspiratory crackles without wheeze or clubbing. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates predominantly involving mid-lower zones while high resolution CT scan showed ground glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening. Pulmonary function tests revealed a restrictive pattern with decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Serological testing was positive for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA).

Which one of the following is true regarding this patient's condition? 

A. The most likely diagnosis is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
B. This patient has hypersensitivity pneumonitis 
C. The presence of ANA and dsDNA rules out other possible diagnoses
D. Lung biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis in this case
E. Treatment options are limited and mainly supportive

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation, radiological findings, and serological markers suggest that this patient has an autoimmune disease-associated ILD rather than IPF or any other cause of ILD. The presence of ANA and dsDNA suggests systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can present with respiratory symptoms due to various lung manifestations including interstitial lung disease, pleurisy, pulmonary hypertension etc., although it is less common than rheumatoid arthritis as a cause of autoimmune-related ILD. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis given the history of joint pains, skin rash, weight loss along with exposure to potential environmental triggers such as mold or bird droppings.

Question
A 65-year-old male ex-smoker presented with progressive dyspnoea on exertion for several years duration. He had no significant past medical history except for hypertension controlled by medication. His physical examination was unremarkable except for bibasilar fine inspiratory crackles without wheeze or clubbing. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates predominantly involving mid-lower zones while high resolution CT scan showed honeycombing predominantly in lower lobes with traction bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function tests revealed a restrictive pattern with decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis was negative for any infectious or malignant etiology.

Which one of the following is true regarding this patient's condition? 

A. The most likely diagnosis is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
B. This patient has hypersensitivity pneumonitis 
C. The presence of honeycombing on HRCT confirms the diagnosis of UIP
D. Lung biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis in this case
E. Treatment options are limited and mainly supportive

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation, radiological findings, and absence of other identifiable causes suggest that this patient has IPF as the most likely diagnosis rather than any other cause of ILD such as autoimmune disease-associated ILD or environmental exposures like hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Honeycombing predominantly in lower lobes with traction bronchiectasis seen on HRCT is highly suggestive but not diagnostic of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which is considered pathognomonic for IPF if present along with peripheral subpleural distribution and absence of features suggesting alternative diagnoses such as organizing pneumonia, sarcoidosis etc., although surgical lung biopsy may still be required to confirm the diagnosis in some cases where there is uncertainty about the radiological pattern or atypical clinical features.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents with a history of recurrent painful nodules in his groin and buttocks for the past few years. The nodules are often associated with pus discharge, malodour and scarring. He has tried various antibiotics but there is no significant improvement. On examination, multiple erythematous tender nodules with central pus points are noted in the inguinal region, perianal area and buttocks. There is also evidence of sinus tracts connecting these lesions.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Acne vulgaris
B. Erythema nodosum
C. Pilonidal cyst
D. Folliculitis decalvans
E. Hidradenitis suppurativa

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation described above is typical of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), which is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting apocrine gland-bearing skin regions such as the axillae, groin and perianal areas. It typically presents with painful nodules that can progress to abscesses or fistulas leading to extensive scarring and disfigurement.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents with an itchy rash on her legs for the past week associated with fever and chills. She has been treated previously for folliculitis but this time she noticed small red bumps that have spread rapidly over both lower legs within days despite using topical antibiotics prescribed by her GP.

On examination, there are numerous erythematous papules coalescing into plaques on both shins sparing feet and toes bilaterally.

Which one of the following diagnoses should be considered? 

A) Cellulitis 
B) Contact dermatitis 
C) Erysipelas 
D) Granuloma annulare

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with HUS, which typically presents acutely with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment manifesting as acute kidney injury or oliguria/anuria, gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, fever, and neurological symptoms like seizures or altered mental status in severe cases. HSP can also present similarly but would not typically cause such severe renal involvement or require urgent intervention like HUS. TTP can present similarly but would require additional diagnostic criteria beyond those presented here, such as fever or neurological symptoms. SLE and polyarteritis nodosa are less likely given the lack of systemic features like rash or joint pain in this case.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of fatigue, anorexia and abdominal discomfort for the past few weeks. He denies any recent travel or sexual contact. On examination, he is found to have mild jaundice and hepatomegaly. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and positive serology for hepatitis B virus (HBV). Further investigations show evidence of chronic HBV infection with high viral load and HBeAg positivity. The patient is started on antiviral therapy.
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management strategy in this patient?

B. Non-operative management with immobilization in a cast is sufficient for all cases 
C. Surgical fixation should be delayed for at least 4-6 weeks to allow soft tissue healing 
D. Ankle arthroscopy can be used to assess and treat intra-articular pathology 
E. Weight-bearing can be allowed immediately after surgical fixation 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Oblique fractures through the distal fibula that extend into the ankle joint are known as Weber B fractures and are often associated with intra-articular pathology such as ligamentous injuries or osteochondral defects. Ankle arthroscopy can be used both diagnostically and therapeutically in these cases to visualize and address any concomitant injuries within the joint space.

Question
A 28-year-old marathon runner presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his left lower leg after completing a race. On examination, there is tenderness and swelling over the medial aspect of his leg, and he complains of altered sensation over the sole of his foot. Dorsiflexion of the foot and extension of the toes are painful and limited. There is no palpable pulse in his posterior tibial artery or dorsalis pedis artery. MRI reveals a complete rupture of the flexor hallucis longus tendon.

Which one of the following is correct? 

A. Ruptured Achilles tendon
B. Thrombosis of the popliteal artery
C. Deep venous thrombosis
D. Torn muscle bellies of gastronemius and soleus
E. Complete rupture of flexor hallucis longus tendon

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The presentation suggests an injury to the deep posterior compartment which contains muscles that plantarflex and invert the foot as well as flexing toes 2-5, along with neurovascular structures including posterior tibial nerve and vessels supplying this area. The absence of pulses indicates vascular compromise while sensory changes suggest nerve involvement. An MRI confirms a complete rupture of Flexor Hallucis Longus (FHL) tendon which passes through this compartment.

Question
A 32-year-old man presents to Accident & Emergency department with acute onset right calf pain after playing football on uneven ground for several hours without proper warm-up exercises beforehand. He reports feeling a 'pop' at the back of his calf followed by sudden pain, forcing him to stop playing immediately.

On examination, there is significant bruising over the gastrocnemius muscle belly, but no obvious deformity or skin laceration noted on inspection or palpation.

Which one of the following is correct? 

A. Ruptured Achilles tendon
B. Thrombosis of the popliteal artery
C. Deep venous thrombosis
D. Torn muscle bellies of gastrocnemius and soleus
E. Compartment syndrome

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The history is suggestive of an acute injury to the calf muscles, with a 'pop' sensation followed by immediate pain and inability to continue playing. There is no obvious deformity or skin laceration on inspection or palpation, which rules out fractures or open injuries. However, significant bruising over the gastrocnemius muscle belly suggests internal bleeding within the muscle tissue itself, which can occur in cases of ruptured Achilles tendon.

Question
A 40-year-old woman presents to Accident & Emergency department with severe pain in her left ankle after twisting it while walking down stairs at home. On examination, there is swelling and tenderness over the lateral aspect of her ankle joint along with limited range of motion due to pain.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Repeat surgery 
B. Palliative chemotherapy 
C. Radiation therapy 
D. Immunotherapy 
E. Targeted therapy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient has recurrent NSCLC with metastasis, immunotherapy would be an appropriate treatment option for this patient as it has shown to improve survival rates in patients with advanced NSCLC.

Question
A 28-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with a history of fever, headache, and myalgia for the past two weeks. He reports having gone on a camping trip in rural Scotland three weeks ago where he remembers being bitten by an insect but did not notice any rash or symptoms at that time. On examination, there is a circular erythematous rash on his leg consistent with erythema migrans.

What is the most appropriate management?

A. Prescribe amoxicillin for 14 days
B. Prescribe doxycycline for 21 days
C. Refer to an infectious diseases specialist
D. Conduct further tests before starting antibiotics
E. Reassure the patient and provide safety netting advice

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of erythema migrans is diagnostic of Lyme disease and treatment should be initiated immediately without waiting for test results. Doxycycline is the first-line antibiotic recommended by NICE guidelines for adults with early localized or disseminated Lyme disease.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with a history of recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling over the past year along with fatigue and malaise. She has been treated multiple times with antibiotics for suspected Lyme disease as she recalls being bitten by ticks while hiking in Wales several years ago.

On examination, there are no signs of inflammation or synovitis, however, there are tender nodules present on both shins.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Borrelia burgdorferi antibody testing 
B. Synovial fluid analysis 
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
D. Complete blood count (CBC) 
E. Rheumatoid factor (RF)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presentation suggests possible late-stage Lyme arthritis which can be diagnosed with MRI scans of the affected joints. Synovial fluid analysis may also show elevated white blood cell count and protein levels but is not as sensitive as MRI.

Question
A 48-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with a history of progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and difficulty concentrating for the past year. He reports having been bitten by ticks multiple times over the years while working as a park ranger in rural Scotland.

On examination, there are no focal neurological deficits or signs of meningism.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Lyme disease serology 
B. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
C. Lumbar puncture 
D. Electroencephalogram (EEG)
E. Neuropsychological testing

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presentation suggests possible neuroborreliosis which can be diagnosed with brain MRI scans showing characteristic abnormalities such as periventricular hyperintensities and cortical atrophy. Lyme disease serology may support the diagnosis but is not specific enough on its own. Lumbar puncture may show lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein levels but is not always necessary if MRI findings are conclusive. EEG and neuropsychological testing may help assess cognitive function but are not diagnostic of Lyme disease itself.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with a history of night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue for the past six months. On examination, she has multiple enlarged lymph nodes in her neck and axilla. A biopsy reveals diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). She is started on R-CHOP chemotherapy but develops neutropenic sepsis after the second cycle.

Which one of the following antibiotics would be most appropriate to cover gram-negative organisms? 

A. Amoxicillin
B. Ceftriaxone
C. Clindamycin 
D. Metronidazole 
E. Vancomycin

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Neutropenic sepsis is a common complication of chemotherapy in patients with DLBCL. The most common causative organisms are gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover these organisms should be used empirically until culture results are available. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that covers both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and is commonly used for this indication.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with fever, cough, and shortness of breath for two weeks. He has a history of follicular lymphoma treated with rituximab three years ago but has been in remission since then.
On examination, he has bilateral crackles on lung auscultation.
A chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.
What is the most likely cause of his pneumonia? 

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Mycoplasma pneumoniae
C. Legionella pneumophila 
D. Pneumocystis jirovecii 
E. Aspergillus fumigatus

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Patients with follicular lymphoma treated with rituximab are at increased risk of developing Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) due to the prolonged depletion of B-cells. The presentation is similar to other causes of pneumonia, but it can be severe and life-threatening in immunocompromised patients. Treatment involves high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with a large mass in his right groin that has been growing for the past six months. He also complains of abdominal pain and bloating.
A CT scan shows multiple enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and a biopsy confirms diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
Which one of the following factors is associated with a better prognosis? 

A. Age > 60 years
B. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
C. Stage IV disease
D. Involvement of more than one extranodal site 
E. Germinal center B-cell subtype

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, accounting for about 30% of cases. Several prognostic factors have been identified, including age, stage, LDH level, extranodal involvement, and cell-of-origin subtype based on gene expression profiling. The germinal center B-cell subtype is associated with a better prognosis compared to the activated B-cell subtype.

Question
A 72-year-old woman presents to the ophthalmology clinic with a complaint of blurred vision in her left eye for the past few months. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are well-controlled on medications. On examination, visual acuity is 20/30 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye. Fundus examination reveals drusen deposits and pigmentary changes in both eyes, with subretinal fluid and hemorrhage present in the macula of the left eye. Fluorescein angiography confirms choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the left eye.

Which one of the following treatment options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Observation
B. Photodynamic therapy
C. Laser photocoagulation 
D. Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents
E. Submacular surgery

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of CNV indicates wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which can lead to severe vision loss if not treated promptly. Anti-VEGF agents such as ranibizumab or aflibercept have been shown to effectively reduce CNV activity and improve visual outcomes in patients with wet AMD.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to his optometrist with a complaint of difficulty reading small print even with glasses on for several months now. He also reports that straight lines appear wavy or distorted when he looks at them directly, especially when looking at an Amsler grid test card provided by his optometrist.
On fundoscopic examination, yellow-white deposits called drusen are noted bilaterally without any signs of exudation or bleeding.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Wet age-related macular degeneration
B. Dry age-related macular degeneration
C. Diabetic macular edema 
D. Central serous chorioretinopathy 
E. Retinal vein occlusion

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of drusen deposits and distortion of straight lines on an Amsler grid are characteristic features of dry AMD, which is the most common form of AMD accounting for 90% of cases. Dry AMD usually progresses slowly and may not cause severe vision loss until advanced stages.

Question
A 78-year-old woman presents to the ophthalmology clinic with a complaint of sudden onset painless loss of central vision in her left eye over the past few days. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. On examination, visual acuity is 20/25 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye. Fundus examination reveals subretinal hemorrhage and fluid accumulation at the macula in the left eye.

Which one of the following treatment options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Observation
B. Photodynamic therapy
C. Laser photocoagulation 
D. Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents
E. Submacular surgery

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presence of subretinal hemorrhage and fluid accumulation at the macula indicates wet AMD, which can lead to rapid vision loss if not treated promptly with anti-VEGF agents such as ranibizumab or aflibercept to reduce CNV activity and prevent further bleeding or fluid accumulation at the macula.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents with chronic diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. She has a history of Crohn's disease but is currently in remission on mesalazine therapy. Stool examination revealed steatorrhoea and blood tests showed low levels of vitamin D, calcium and albumin. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed which showed scalloping of the duodenal mucosa and biopsies confirmed villous atrophy.
What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? 

A. Coeliac disease
B. Short bowel syndrome
C. Whipple's disease
D. Tropical sprue
E. Giardiasis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests malabsorption, with evidence of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (vitamin D) and protein-losing enteropathy (low albumin). The presence of steatorrhoea indicates pancreatic or small intestinal pathology, while the duodenal biopsy findings are consistent with coeliac disease.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with recurrent episodes of abdominal bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea over several months duration. He has no significant medical history except for hypertension that is well controlled on medication. Blood tests show normal haemoglobin level but low serum iron concentration, elevated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), low ferritin level and raised transferrin saturation.
What is the most likely cause for his symptoms? 

A. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency 
B. Lactose intolerance 
C. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth 
D. Inflammatory bowel disease 
E. Chronic liver disease

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical features suggest malabsorption due to small intestinal pathology such as bacterial overgrowth or inflammatory changes leading to lactase deficiency or maldigestion/malabsorption of carbohydrates/fats/iron. The raised TIBC and low ferritin level indicate iron deficiency anaemia, which is commonly seen in malabsorption syndromes.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with chronic diarrhoea, weight loss and abdominal pain for several months duration. She has a history of alcohol abuse but stopped drinking six months ago. Blood tests show macrocytic anaemia, elevated liver enzymes and low vitamin B12 levels.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Coeliac disease 
B. Chronic pancreatitis 
C. Tropical sprue
D. Autoimmune hepatitis
E. Alcoholic liver disease

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features suggest malabsorption due to small intestinal pathology or pancreatic insufficiency leading to maldigestion/malabsorption of nutrients such as vitamin B12/fats/carbohydrates/proteins, resulting in macrocytic anaemia and weight loss. However, the presence of elevated liver enzymes suggests underlying hepatic pathology such as alcoholic liver disease, which can cause secondary malabsorption due to impaired bile acid secretion and fat digestion/absorption in the small intestine.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a fever of 39°C, chills, and headache. He recently returned from a trip to sub-Saharan Africa where he spent most of his time in rural areas without access to mosquito nets or insect repellent. On examination, he has splenomegaly and mild jaundice. Blood tests reveal thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and anaemia.
A rapid diagnostic test for malaria is negative, but Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films demonstrate Plasmodium falciparum malaria with a parasitaemia of 1%. The patient is started on artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), but after two days of treatment, his symptoms worsen. Repeat blood tests show worsening anaemia and thrombocytopenia.
What is the most likely explanation for this patient's clinical deterioration? 

A. Drug resistance
B. Severe malarial anaemia
C. Cerebral malaria
D. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
E. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Severe malarial anaemia occurs when P.falciparum-infected red blood cells are destroyed by the spleen leading to haemolysis and reduced erythropoiesis resulting in severe anaemia.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with fever, headache and myalgia following her return from a trip to West Africa where she was working as a volunteer in a remote village without access to prophylaxis against malaria. She reports that she took chloroquine prophylaxis prior to travel but stopped taking it due to gastrointestinal side effects.
On examination, she appears pale with no other significant findings except for an enlarged spleen palpable below the left costal margin.
Blood tests reveal a haemoglobin level of 8.5g/dL, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes.
A rapid diagnostic test for malaria is negative, but Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films demonstrate Plasmodium falciparum malaria with a parasitaemia of 0.5%. 
What is the most appropriate management strategy? 

A. Repeat the rapid diagnostic test
B. Start artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
C. Start doxycycline
D. Perform PCR testing for malaria
E. Re-start chloroquine prophylaxis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Despite a negative rapid diagnostic test, if there is strong clinical suspicion of malaria in a patient who has recently travelled to an endemic area, treatment should be initiated based on microscopy results.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with fever, headache and myalgia following his return from a trip to East Africa where he was working as a volunteer in refugee camps without access to prophylaxis against malaria.
On examination, he appears pale with no other significant findings except for an enlarged spleen palpable below the left costal margin.
Blood tests reveal normocytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes.
A rapid diagnostic test for malaria is negative, but Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films demonstrate Plasmodium ovale malaria with a parasitaemia of 0.2%.
Which antimalarial drug would be most effective? 

A. Chloroquine
B. Mefloquine
C. Artemether-lumefantrine
D. Primaquine
E. Atovaquone-proguanil

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: P.ovale can form hypnozoites which are not cleared by standard antimalarial drugs like chloroquine, mefloquine or artemisinin-based combination therapy. Primaquine is the drug of choice for radical cure of P.ovale malaria as it can eliminate hypnozoites from the liver.

Question
A 65-year-old patient presents to the dermatology clinic with a pigmented lesion on their back that has been present for several years. The lesion is asymmetrical, has irregular borders, and varies in color from dark brown to black. On examination, the lesion measures 2 cm in diameter and has recently started to itch. The clinician suspects malignant melanoma and orders a biopsy of the lesion.

What are the histopathological features that would confirm the diagnosis? 

A. Presence of atypical melanocytes within the epidermis
B. Absence of mitotic figures within the dermis
C. Normal architecture of collagen fibers within the dermis
D. Presence of lymphocytic infiltration around blood vessels
E. Increased number of Langerhans cells within the epidermis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Malignant melanoma is diagnosed based on histopathological examination of a skin biopsy sample. The presence of atypical melanocytes within the epidermis confirms the diagnosis.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents with a suspicious mole on her leg that has been gradually increasing in size over several months. She reports no other symptoms but is concerned about skin cancer due to her family history of melanoma.
On examination, there is an asymmetrically shaped mole measuring 8 mm x 6 mm with variegated coloration and irregular borders.
The clinician performs a shave biopsy which reveals superficial spreading malignant melanoma (SSMM). What is SSMM? 

A. An aggressive form of basal cell carcinoma 
B. A subtype of squamous cell carcinoma 
C. A type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
D. The most common type of malignant melanoma 
E. A rare variant characterized by rapid growth and early metastasis 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Superficial spreading malignant melanoma (SSMM) is the most common type of malignant melanoma, accounting for approximately 70% of all cases. It is characterized by a slow horizontal growth phase before vertical invasion and metastasis.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the dermatology clinic with a suspicious mole on his back that has been present for several years but has recently started to itch and bleed. On examination, there is an asymmetrically shaped mole measuring 1 cm x 1 cm with variegated coloration and irregular borders.
The clinician performs an excision biopsy which reveals nodular malignant melanoma (NMM). What is NMM? 

A. A subtype of basal cell carcinoma 
B. A rare variant characterized by early lymphatic spread 
C. The second most common type of malignant melanoma 
D. A type of lentigo maligna melanoma 
E. An aggressive form characterized by rapid vertical growth and early metastasis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Nodular malignant melanoma (NMM) is an aggressive subtype characterized by rapid vertical growth and early metastasis. It accounts for approximately 15-20% of all cases of malignant melanoma and has a poorer prognosis than other subtypes due to its tendency to rapidly invade surrounding tissues and organs.

Question
A 70-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath and fatigue. On examination, he appears cachectic and malnourished. His laboratory results reveal low albumin levels, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and decreased prealbumin levels.

Which of the following is the most appropriate tool to assess this patient's nutritional status? 

A. Subjective Global Assessment
B. Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool
C. Mini Nutritional Assessment
D. Nutrition Risk Screening 2002
E. Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) is a validated tool used to assess nutritional status in hospitalized patients or those at risk for malnutrition due to underlying medical conditions such as COPD. It takes into account both subjective and objective factors including weight loss, dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, functional capacity, physical examination findings, and laboratory values.

Question
A 60-year-old woman with advanced pancreatic cancer has been experiencing significant weight loss over the past few months despite receiving chemotherapy treatment. She reports feeling full after only a few bites of food and experiences nausea frequently throughout the day.

Which of the following interventions would be most appropriate for managing her symptoms? 

A. Enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube 
B. Total parenteral nutrition via central venous catheter 
C. Oral nutritional supplements 
D. Appetite stimulants 
E. Antiemetic medications 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with anorexia-cachexia syndrome commonly seen in advanced cancer patients which can lead to severe malnutrition if not properly managed. Antiemetic medications such as ondansetron or metoclopramide can help alleviate nausea and improve appetite allowing for better oral intake.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse presents to the clinic with symptoms of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome including confusion, ataxia, and memory impairment. He reports not eating much over the past few weeks due to his symptoms and has lost significant weight.

Which of the following laboratory findings would be consistent with malnutrition? 

A. Elevated serum albumin levels 
B. Decreased serum transferrin levels 
C. Elevated serum prealbumin levels 
D. Increased total lymphocyte count 
E. Normal creatinine kinase levels

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Transferrin is an iron-binding protein that reflects visceral protein stores in the body and decreases during periods of malnutrition or inflammation. In contrast, albumin and prealbumin are acute phase reactants that may increase during inflammatory states leading to false reassurance of adequate nutritional status. Total lymphocyte count can also be affected by other factors such as infection or medication use making it less specific for assessing malnutrition in this patient population.

Question
A 6-year-old child presents to the emergency department with a high-grade fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis. The child's parents report that they have not vaccinated their child against measles due to religious beliefs. On examination, the child has a maculopapular rash on the face and trunk. The clinician suspects measles infection and orders investigations including a full blood count, liver function tests and serology for measles.

Which of the following is true regarding the management of this patient? 

A. Administering antibiotics will help in treating measles.
B. Isolation precautions are unnecessary as measles is not highly infectious.
C. Vitamin A supplementation should be given to prevent complications.
D. Measles vaccination can be administered during an acute illness.
E. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) should be given within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: IVIG administration within 24 hours of symptom onset has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe or complicated measles infections who are unable to mount an adequate immune response.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with a history of fever, headache and malaise for four days followed by development of a rash on her face which then spread down her body over three days. She reports no recent travel history but mentions having had contact with someone who was diagnosed with measles two weeks ago.

On examination, she has bilateral conjunctival injection without exudate, Koplik spots on her buccal mucosa and a diffuse maculopapular rash that started from her head and progressed downwards sparing palms and soles.

What is the most appropriate course of action? 

A. Prescribe antiviral medication
B. Start oral steroids immediately
C. Admit patient for intravenous fluids
D. Order serological testing only if there is doubt about diagnosis
E. Administer measles vaccine

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Clinical features are highly suggestive of measles, and serological testing should be ordered only if there is doubt about the diagnosis as it can lead to false-negative results in early stages.

Question
A 10-year-old boy presents with a history of fever, cough and rash for three days. He has no significant past medical history and his parents report that he is up-to-date with all vaccinations including MMR (measles, mumps, rubella). On examination, he has a maculopapular rash on his face which then spreads down his body over two days. There are no other clinical findings.

What is the most likely cause? 

A. Measles infection despite vaccination
B. Rubella infection despite vaccination
C. Parvovirus B19 infection
D. Scarlet fever
E. Kawasaki disease

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Although rare, breakthrough infections can occur after MMR vaccination but they tend to have milder symptoms than unvaccinated individuals and complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis are less common.

Question

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Vestibular neuritis 
B. Meniere’s disease
C. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo 
D. Acoustic neuroma 
E.Central vertigo 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The acute onset of symptoms along with persistent horizontal nystagmus indicates central vertigo as a possible cause requiring further investigation to rule out any underlying pathology in the brainstem or cerebellum.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of fever, headache, and neck stiffness. He has no past medical history but reports recent travel to an area endemic for meningitis. On examination, he is alert and oriented but complains of photophobia and severe neck pain. His vital signs are within normal limits. Blood tests reveal leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. CT scan of the head is unremarkable.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Start empiric antibiotics
B. Perform a lumbar puncture 
C. Administer antiviral medication 
D. Order a brain MRI 
E. Initiate corticosteroid therapy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with meningitis, which requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications such as seizures or cerebral edema. Lumbar puncture remains the gold standard diagnostic test for meningitis, allowing for analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) including cell count, protein level, glucose level, and culture.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of fever, headache, nausea/vomiting, and confusion over the last few days.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents with abdominal pain and weight loss over several months duration; he also reports having blood in his stool occasionally but does not seek medical attention until now due to fear of COVID-19 exposure at hospitals during the pandemic period.He undergoes colonoscopy which shows an obstructing mass in the sigmoid colon that biopsy confirms adenocarcinoma.The CT scan reveals extensive liver metastases.What should be your next step? 

A. Refer for surgical resection of the primary tumor
B. Initiate systemic chemotherapy 
C. Perform radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases 
D. Start immunotherapy with pembrolizumab 
E. Observe and monitor

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, first-line treatment typically involves systemic chemotherapy, which has been shown to improve survival in this patient population. Surgical resection may be considered in select cases where the primary tumor is obstructing or causing other complications, but it would not be appropriate as a first-line therapy for extensive liver metastases. Radiofrequency ablation may also be an option for some patients with limited liver metastases, but it would not be appropriate in this case given the extent of disease. Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab is currently only approved for certain types of advanced solid tumors that have specific genetic mutations or biomarkers; it is not yet approved for use in metastatic colorectal cancer without these markers. Observation and monitoring alone would not be appropriate management for this patient's condition.

Question
A 62-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with a history of fever, cough, and shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He has a medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. On examination, he is found to have bilateral crepitations in his lungs and an elevated temperature. His laboratory investigations reveal leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. The patient is started on antibiotics and supportive care but continues to deteriorate over the next few days with worsening respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation. Which of the following statements regarding multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in this patient is true? 

A. MODS occurs due to a single organ failure.
B. MODS can only occur as a result of sepsis.
C. The presence of thrombocytopenia excludes the diagnosis of MODS.
D. Acute kidney injury is not considered part of MODS criteria.
E. Treatment should focus on addressing the underlying cause and providing supportive care.

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) refers to progressive dysfunction or failure of two or more organs resulting from an uncontrolled inflammatory response triggered by various insults such as infection, trauma, burns or surgery among others. It is characterized by widespread tissue hypoxia leading to cellular damage and organ dysfunction/failure that may be reversible or irreversible depending on severity and duration of insult(s). In this case, the patient's presentation suggests severe pneumonia complicated by sepsis-induced MODS involving multiple organs including lungs (respiratory system), liver (hepatobiliary system), kidneys (renal system), and bone marrow (hematopoietic system). Management involves prompt identification/treatment of underlying causes along with aggressive supportive measures aimed at maintaining adequate oxygenation, perfusion, and organ function.

Her laboratory investigations reveal leukocytosis with left shift, elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis. Abdominal ultrasound shows evidence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) along with ascites and hepatomegaly. CT scan confirms the diagnosis of PVT extending into the superior mesenteric vein causing bowel ischemia. The patient is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy and supportive care but continues to deteriorate over the next few hours requiring ICU admission. Which of the following statements regarding MODS in this patient is true? 

A. MODS can only occur as a result of bacterial infections.
B. Acute pancreatitis is not considered part of MODS criteria.
C. The presence of coagulopathy excludes the diagnosis of MODS.
D. Bowel ischemia due to PVT can lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulting in MODS.
E. Treatment should focus on addressing sepsis-induced shock without considering underlying causes.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In this case, the patient's presentation suggests severe sepsis secondary to bowel ischemia caused by PVT complicating chronic hepatitis C infection among other risk factors such as intravenous drug use or hypercoagulable state that may contribute to clot formation within hepatic vasculature leading to multiple organ dysfunction/failure including respiratory distress (lungs), altered mental status (brain), jaundice/ascites (liver), oliguria/anuria (kidneys) and coagulopathy (hematopoietic system). Bowel ischemia can trigger SIRS characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to MODS. Management involves prompt identification/treatment of underlying causes along with aggressive supportive measures aimed at maintaining adequate oxygenation, perfusion, and organ function.

Question

He has a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction. On examination, he is found to be hypotensive with tachycardia and elevated jugular venous pressure. His laboratory investigations reveal elevated cardiac enzymes consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) along with metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4 suggestive of anterior wall MI. The patient is started on antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation therapy, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and supportive care but continues to deteriorate over the next few days requiring mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Which of the following statements regarding MODS in this patient is true? 

A. MODS occurs only as a result of sepsis.
B. Acute kidney injury is not considered part of MODS criteria.
C. Elevated jugular venous pressure excludes the diagnosis of MODS.
D. ACS-induced cardiogenic shock can lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulting in MODS.
E. Treatment should focus on addressing cardiovascular instability without considering other organ systems.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In this case, the patient's presentation suggests severe ACS complicated by cardiogenic shock leading to multiple organ dysfunction/failure including respiratory distress (lungs), altered mental status (brain), oliguria/anuria (kidneys), and metabolic acidosis (hematopoietic system). Cardiogenic shock can trigger SIRS characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to MODS. Management involves prompt identification/treatment of underlying causes along with aggressive supportive measures aimed at maintaining adequate oxygenation, perfusion, and organ function.

Question
A 60-year-old male presents to the hospital with severe bone pain and fatigue. Upon examination, he is found to have multiple osteolytic lesions in his spine and ribs. Blood tests reveal mild anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcaemia, and a raised creatinine level. Further investigations show that the patient has monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). What is MGUS? Which diagnostic criteria are used to diagnose it? How does it differ from multiple myeloma? What are the risk factors for progression of MGUS? 

A. Increased serum protein levels
B. Presence of M-protein in blood or urine
C. Bone marrow biopsy showing clonal plasma cells <10%
D. All of the above
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant disorder characterized by an abnormal proliferation of plasma cells producing monoclonal immunoglobulin without any clinical symptoms or organ damage associated with multiple myeloma (MM). The diagnosis requires all three criteria - increased serum protein levels, presence of M-protein in blood or urine, and bone marrow biopsy showing clonal plasma cells <10%. Although most patients with MGUS remain stable throughout their lives, some may progress to MM or other lymphoproliferative disorders over time. Risk factors for progression include older age (>70 years), higher levels of M-protein (>15 g/L), and abnormal free light chain ratio.

Question
A 55-year-old female was diagnosed with multiple myeloma two years ago and underwent chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). She now presents with new-onset back pain and worsening fatigue despite being on maintenance therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Imaging studies reveal spinal cord compression due to a large extramedullary plasmacytoma. What is an extramedullary plasmacytoma? How does it differ from solitary bone plasmacytoma? What are the treatment options for extramedullary plasmacytoma? 

A. Radiation therapy
B. Chemotherapy
C. Surgery
D. All of the above
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Extramedullary plasmacytomas (EMPs) are rare plasma cell neoplasms that arise outside the bone marrow and lack systemic manifestations of multiple myeloma (MM). They can occur in any soft tissue or organ, but most commonly involve the upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, or lymph nodes. EMPs may present as a primary lesion or as part of MM progression, and their prognosis depends on various factors such as location, size, histology, and treatment response. Treatment options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery depending on the site and extent of disease.

Question
A 70-year-old male with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma presents to his oncologist for initial management.

B. Lenalidomide + dexamethasone
C. Cyclophosphamide + thalidomide + dexamethasone 
D. Daratumumab + bortezomib + dexamethasone 
E. Carfilzomib + lenalidomide + dexamethasone

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Induction therapy is the initial treatment given to patients with multiple myeloma to achieve disease control and improve survival outcomes. The choice of regimen depends on various factors such as patient age, comorbidities, disease stage, and treatment goals. Lenalidomide + dexamethasone (Rd) is a commonly used induction regimen for newly diagnosed MM patients who are not eligible for ASCT or have high-risk cytogenetics. It consists of lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent that enhances T-cell function and inhibits angiogenesis, and dexamethasone, a corticosteroid that has anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic effects. Rd is usually given in cycles of 28 days for up to six months or until maximal response is achieved. Common adverse effects associated with this regimen include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and venous thromboembolism.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents with a history of fluctuating weakness in his limbs, which is more pronounced towards the end of the day and improves after rest. He also complains of difficulty swallowing liquids and solids. On examination, he has bilateral ptosis that worsens on sustained upward gaze and fatigues with repeated testing. His limb strength is reduced but improves after rest.

Further investigations reveal positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies, decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation, and thymic hyperplasia on CT scan.

Which of the following treatments would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. High-dose oral corticosteroids
B. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)
C. Plasmapheresis
D. Rituximab
E. Azathioprine

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient has classic features of myasthenia gravis (MG) including fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability, bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia, and positive serological markers for MG (acetylcholine receptor antibodies). Thymic abnormalities are commonly associated with MG.

Plasmapheresis is an effective treatment option for patients with severe or refractory MG by removing circulating autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors from the blood plasma.

High-dose oral corticosteroids can be used to induce remission in MG; however, they have significant side effects and long-term use should be avoided if possible.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is another treatment option for acute exacerbations of MG; it works by blocking the binding of autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions.

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets B cells; it may be useful in refractory cases of MG where other treatments have failed.

Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent that can be used to maintain remission in MG; however, it has a slow onset of action and may take several months before clinical improvement is seen. 

Question
A 42-year-old female presents with progressive muscle weakness over the past few weeks. She reports difficulty climbing stairs and getting up from a seated position. On examination, she has bilateral ptosis, fatigable limb weakness, and dysarthria. Her deep tendon reflexes are intact.

Which of the following investigations would be most helpful in diagnosing this patient? 

A. Electromyography (EMG)
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain
C. Lumbar puncture
D. Muscle biopsy
E. Serum creatine kinase levels

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's symptoms are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG), which is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability that worsens with sustained activity.

Electromyography (EMG) is a useful diagnostic tool for MG as it can detect decremental responses on repetitive nerve stimulation and abnormal jitter on single-fiber EMG.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain may be indicated if there are other neurological signs or symptoms suggestive of central nervous system involvement.

Lumbar puncture may be performed to rule out infectious or inflammatory causes of her symptoms but is not specific for MG.

Muscle biopsy may show evidence of denervation atrophy but is not necessary for diagnosis in typical cases of MG.

Serum creatine kinase levels may be elevated in some forms of muscular dystrophy but are typically normal in patients with MG.


Question
A 58-year-old male presents with worsening fatigue and muscle weakness over the past few months. He also complains of double vision when looking upwards and difficulty swallowing solid foods. On examination, he has bilateral ptosis, fatigable limb weakness, and dysphagia.

Which of the following antibodies is most likely to be elevated in this patient? 

A. Anti-AChR (acetylcholine receptor) antibodies
B. Anti-MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) antibodies
C. Anti-LRP4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4) antibodies
D. Anti-GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65) antibodies
E. Anti-VGKC (voltage-gated potassium channel) antibodies

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's symptoms are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG), which is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability that worsens with sustained activity.

Anti-MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) antibodies are found in approximately 30% of patients with MG who are negative for anti-AChR (acetylcholine receptor) antibodies. These patients tend to have more severe bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia and respiratory muscle weakness.

Anti-LRP4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4) antibodies are also associated with a subset of MG patients but are less common than anti-MuSK or anti-AChR antibodies.

Anti-GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65) antibodies are typically associated with autoimmune neurological disorders such as stiff-person syndrome or cerebellar ataxia.

Anti-VGKC (voltage-gated potassium channel) antibodies may be seen in some cases of limbic encephalitis or neuromyotonia but are not specific for MG.

Question
A 35-year-old female patient presents to the emergency department with a history of progressive swelling in her legs and abdomen for the past two weeks. She also complains of shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue. Her medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. On examination, she has bilateral pitting edema up to mid-thighs, ascites, and pleural effusion. Blood tests reveal hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria.

Which one of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation? 

A. Minimal change disease
B. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
C. Membranous nephropathy
D. IgA nephropathy
E. Amyloidosis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical picture described above is consistent with nephrotic syndrome which can be caused by various underlying renal pathologies such as minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy (MN), IgA nephropathy or amyloidosis among others. However, given that the patient has preexisting hypertension and diabetes mellitus along with heavy proteinuria (>3g/day) and hypoalbuminemia (<30 g/L), MN should be considered as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 48-year-old male patient was diagnosed with idiopathic membranous nephropathy five years ago after presenting with generalized edema, frothy urine, and weight gain over several months duration. He was started on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and diuretics but his condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment optimization over time.

What would be the next best step in managing this patient? 

A. Initiate corticosteroid therapy 
B. Start immunosuppressive agents 
C. Perform a kidney biopsy 
D. Refer for renal transplant evaluation 
E. Continue current management and monitor closely

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and it can be idiopathic or secondary to an underlying disease such as malignancy, infections, or autoimmune disorders. The diagnosis of MN requires kidney biopsy which shows thickening of the glomerular basement membrane with subepithelial immune complex deposits on electron microscopy. Treatment options depend on the severity of proteinuria, degree of hypoalbuminemia, and risk factors for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In this case, given that the patient has not responded to initial therapy with ACEIs and diuretics over five years duration, a repeat kidney biopsy should be performed to evaluate for any changes in histology and guide further management.

Question
A 62-year-old male patient presents with acute onset lower limb edema and frothy urine for two days duration. He reports no significant past medical history except for hypertension controlled by medication. On examination, he has bilateral pitting edema up to mid-calfs but no other remarkable findings.

Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing the diagnosis? 

A. Serum creatinine level
B. Urine dipstick test
C. Renal ultrasound scan
D. Anti-streptolysin O titer
E. Chest X-ray

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation described above is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome which is characterized by heavy proteinuria (>3g/day), hypoalbuminemia (<30 g/L), hyperlipidemia, and edema formation due to increased capillary permeability caused by glomerular damage. The first step in evaluating patients suspected of having nephrotic syndrome is performing a urine dipstick test which detects albuminuria/proteinuria. If positive, a 24-hour urine collection should be performed to quantify the amount of protein excreted per day and assess the severity of disease. Other investigations such as serum creatinine level, renal ultrasound scan, anti-streptolysin O titer or chest X-ray may be useful in identifying underlying causes or complications of nephrotic syndrome but are not diagnostic.

Question
A 6-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department by his parents with a history of vomiting and lethargy for the past two days. On examination, he appears dehydrated and has multiple bruises on his body in various stages of healing. The parents deny any history of trauma or injury.

A 70-year-old man presents with dysphagia and weight loss over several months. An OGD reveals a tumour in the proximal third of his oesophagus that extends into the hypopharynx. Biopsy results confirm squamous cell carcinoma.

Which one of the following statements about hypopharyngeal extension is true? 

A. It is more common in adenocarcinomas than squamous cell carcinomas 
B. Surgery alone can achieve complete remission in most cases 
C. Chemotherapy has no role in the management of these patients 
D. The prognosis is worse compared to those without hypopharyngeal involvement 
E. Radiation therapy alone can cure most cases

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Hypopharyngeal extension is associated with a worse prognosis due to increased risk of local recurrence, distant metastasis, and poor response to treatment.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with sudden onset of blurred vision in her left eye, associated with pain on eye movement and a central scotoma. She has no significant past medical history but reports having had a recent upper respiratory tract infection. On examination, there is a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye and fundoscopy reveals optic disc swelling. MRI scan of the brain shows periventricular white matter lesions typical for multiple sclerosis (MS). The patient is started on high-dose intravenous steroids for presumed MS-related optic neuritis. However, despite treatment, she continues to experience worsening visual acuity over the next few days.
Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Repeat MRI scan of the brain
B. Lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands
C. Visual evoked potentials testing 
D. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) to rule out cerebral venous thrombosis
E. Refer to neuro-ophthalmologist for further evaluation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In this case, given that the patient's symptoms have not improved with steroid therapy as expected, it would be important to perform lumbar puncture to assess CSF oligoclonal bands which are present in up to 90% of patients with MS-related optic neuritis and can help confirm the diagnosis.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents with acute loss of vision in his right eye that occurred suddenly upon waking up from sleep one morning without any preceding symptoms or trauma. He reports seeing only light perception when he covers his left eye but can count fingers at close range if he looks directly at them using his affected right eye alone. Examination reveals an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye and pale swollen optic disc consistent with optic neuritis. MRI scan of the brain and orbits is unremarkable, and there are no other neurological deficits.
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)
B. Multiple sclerosis (MS)-related optic neuritis
C. Ischemic optic neuropathy 
D. Optic nerve compression by a tumor or aneurysm
E. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation with sudden onset of painless vision loss in one eye, pale swollen optic disc, and absence of any other neurological findings suggests ischemic optic neuropathy as the most likely diagnosis.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of blurred vision affecting both eyes over the past year, which typically last for several weeks before resolving spontaneously without treatment. She reports that her symptoms are worse when she is stressed or fatigued but improve with rest. On examination, there are no visual field defects or relative afferent pupillary defect, and fundoscopy shows normal optic discs bilaterally.
Which one of the following investigations would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis? 

A. Visual evoked potentials testing 
B. Lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and orbits 
D. Serum anti-aquaporin-4 antibody testing
E. Serum vitamin B12 level measurement

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In this case, given the history of recurrent episodes of transient bilateral visual disturbances without evidence of optic disc swelling or inflammation on examination, visual evoked potentials testing can help establish whether there is subclinical demyelination affecting the optic nerves consistent with multiple sclerosis-related optic neuritis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).

Question
A 65-year-old male patient presents to his GP with complaints of pain in both knees and hips for the past year. He describes that he has difficulty walking, climbing stairs, and getting up from a chair due to the pain. The patient reports no history of trauma or injury to the affected joints. On examination, there is tenderness on palpation over both knee joints and hips. There is crepitus on movement of the joints, reduced range of motion, and joint effusion. An X-ray shows osteophytes formation, subchondral sclerosis, joint space narrowing, and cyst formation.

What are the risk factors associated with this condition? 

A. Age >50 years
B. Female gender
C. Obesity
D. Previous joint injury
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is more common in older age groups (>50 years). Women are more commonly affected than men due to hormonal differences between genders which affect bone density and cartilage health. Obesity is another significant risk factor as it increases mechanical stress on weight-bearing joints such as knees and hips leading to accelerated wear-and-tear damage to articular cartilage resulting in OA development or progression. Previous joint injuries can also lead to post-traumatic OA due to altered biomechanics within the joint.

Question
A 70-year-old female patient presents with chronic pain in her left hip for several months which has worsened recently despite taking analgesics regularly without relief. She has a history of hypertension managed by medication but otherwise no other medical problems or surgeries previously except for a hysterectomy at age 55 years old due to uterine fibroids.
On examination, there is limited range of motion on internal rotation of her left hip with tenderness overlying greater trochanter. An X-ray shows joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Rheumatoid arthritis
B. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head
C. Osteoarthritis
D. Femoral neck fracture
E. Trochanteric bursitis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest trochanteric bursitis which is a common cause of hip pain in older adults due to inflammation of the bursa overlying greater trochanter caused by repetitive microtrauma or degenerative changes in adjacent tendons or muscles leading to frictional irritation of the bursa during movement. Radiographic features such as joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation are typical findings seen in OA but not specific for this condition alone.

Question
A 60-year-old male patient presents with chronic pain in his right knee for several months that has worsened recently despite taking analgesics regularly without relief. He reports no history of trauma or injury to the affected joint previously.
On examination, there is tenderness on palpation over medial aspect of his right knee with crepitus on movement and reduced range of motion.
An X-ray shows joint space narrowing, subchondral cysts, and marginal osteophytes.

What is the most appropriate treatment option? 

A. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection
B. Oral diclofenac with omeprazole
C. Topical capsaicin cream
D. Weight loss program 
E. Knee arthroplasty

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Non-pharmacological interventions such as weight loss programs can be effective in reducing mechanical stress on weight-bearing joints like knees which can slow down disease progression and improve symptoms in patients with OA. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections can provide short-term pain relief but are associated with potential adverse effects such as joint infection, cartilage damage, and osteoporosis if used frequently. Oral NSAIDs like diclofenac or topical capsaicin cream can also be used to manage pain in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms but may not be suitable for long-term use due to their side effect profile. Knee arthroplasty is a surgical option reserved for end-stage disease when conservative measures have failed.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with complaints of bone pain and muscle weakness for the last six months. She has a history of gastric bypass surgery two years ago, after which she lost significant weight. Her diet is poor, and she does not take any vitamin supplements regularly. On examination, there is tenderness over the ribs and sternum, and proximal muscle weakness in both upper and lower limbs.

Which of the following laboratory findings would be most consistent with a diagnosis of osteomalacia?

A. High calcium levels
B. Low phosphate levels
C. High parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels
D. Elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
E. Normal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by defective mineralization of newly formed bone matrix due to inadequate amounts or impaired metabolism of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. The most common cause of osteomalacia is vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption leading to low serum phosphate levels, resulting in decreased hydroxyapatite formation in bones leading to softening and bending deformities such as bowing of legs or kyphosis.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of chronic back pain that has been worsening over the past year despite taking analgesics regularly. He also reports difficulty walking long distances due to fatigue and muscle weakness in his legs.

On examination, he has tenderness over his spine and pelvis with no neurological deficits noted on motor or sensory testing.

What imaging modality would be best suited for evaluating this patient's condition? 

A. X-ray lumbar spine 
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lumbar spine 
C. Computed tomography (CT) scan lumbar spine 
D. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan 
E. Bone scintigraphy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Osteomalacia can present with chronic bone pain and muscle weakness, which may be misdiagnosed as other conditions such as osteoporosis or fibromyalgia. MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting early changes of osteomalacia in bones, including diffuse low signal intensity on T1-weighted images due to increased unmineralized matrix content.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of generalized aches and pains, particularly in her hips and lower back. She has been feeling more fatigued than usual lately and reports difficulty climbing stairs or standing up from a seated position.

On examination, there is tenderness over both hips and proximal muscles of both legs. Blood tests reveal low serum calcium levels but normal phosphate levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Osteitis fibrosa cystica
B. Osteomalacia
C. Hypoparathyroidism
D. Renal tubular acidosis
E. Vitamin D toxicity

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presentation of this patient suggests a diagnosis of osteomalacia, which is characterized by defective mineralization of newly formed bone matrix due to inadequate amounts or impaired metabolism of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. Low serum calcium levels are often seen in patients with osteomalacia due to decreased hydroxyapatite formation in bones leading to softening and bending deformities such as bowing of legs or kyphosis. Normal phosphate levels suggest that hypophosphatemia is not the cause of this patient's condition; however, further investigations are needed to determine the underlying etiology of her vitamin D deficiency.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a fever, chills, and severe pain in his left leg. He has a history of intravenous drug use and was recently treated for cellulitis in the same area. On examination, there is erythema, warmth, and tenderness over the medial aspect of his left tibia. Laboratory investigations show an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. An X-ray shows periosteal elevation and cortical thickening consistent with osteomyelitis. What are the most common causative organisms in this patient? 

A. Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae
B. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica 
D. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Nocardia spp.
E. Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with a history of intravenous drug use, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of osteomyelitis followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Question
A 55-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus presents with a non-healing ulcer on her right foot that has been present for several weeks despite treatment with antibiotics and wound care measures. She reports increasing pain in her foot over the past few days along with fevers, chills, and malaise. On examination, there is erythema, warmth, swelling, crepitus overlying the plantar surface of her right forefoot extending into the midfoot region without any obvious bony deformity or instability noted on weight-bearing radiographs? What is the next best step? 

A. MRI scan
B. CT scan
C. Bone biopsy
D. Ultrasound
E. PET scan

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In diabetic patients with non-healing ulcers and clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, bone biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a fever, chills, and severe pain in his left arm. He has a history of intravenous drug use and was recently treated for cellulitis in the same area. On examination, there is erythema, warmth, and tenderness over the medial aspect of his left humerus. Laboratory investigations show an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. An X-ray shows periosteal elevation and cortical thickening consistent with osteomyelitis? What are the most common complications associated with this condition? 

A. Septicemia and septic shock
B. Fracture non-union and malunion 
C. Joint destruction and contractures 
D. Growth disturbance in children 
E. Chronic pain syndrome 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Osteomyelitis can lead to systemic infection resulting in septicemia or sepsis if not treated promptly which can be life-threatening especially in immunocompromised individuals such as those with diabetes mellitus or HIV/AIDS

Question
A 65-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with a history of multiple vertebral fractures and chronic back pain. She has been on long-term glucocorticoid therapy for her rheumatoid arthritis. Her DEXA scan shows a T-score of -3.5 at the lumbar spine and -2.8 at the femoral neck, indicating severe osteoporosis. The patient is concerned about the risk of future fractures and wants to know what treatment options are available.

Which of the following medications would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Teriparatide
B. Denosumab
C. Raloxifene
D. Calcitonin
E. Alendronate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Given the patient's high fracture risk, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits bone resorption by binding to RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand), would be an appropriate choice as it has been shown to reduce vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fractures in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with a recent wrist fracture after falling from standing height onto his outstretched hand. He reports no previous fractures but is concerned about his bone health as his mother had osteoporosis and he has lost several inches in height over the years.

Which of the following investigations would be most useful in assessing this patient? 

A. Serum calcium levels 
B. Serum vitamin D levels 
C. Thyroid function tests 
D. Parathyroid hormone levels 
E. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: A DEXA scan is recommended for all men aged 70 or older who have risk factors for osteoporosis, including a parental history of hip fracture. This test can measure bone mineral density and assess the patient's risk of future fractures.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent kidney stones and chronic back pain. She has been taking high doses of vitamin D supplements for several years on the advice of her naturopathic practitioner. Her DEXA scan shows a T-score of -2.6 at the lumbar spine and -1.8 at the femoral neck, indicating osteopenia.

Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's bone loss? 

A. Primary hyperparathyroidism
B. Chronic renal failure
C. Vitamin D toxicity 
D. Cushing's syndrome 
E. Anorexia nervosa

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Excessive intake of vitamin D supplements can lead to hypercalcemia, which in turn can cause bone resorption and increase the risk of fractures. Patients should be advised to avoid high-dose vitamin D supplementation unless prescribed by a healthcare professional for a specific medical condition such as osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe ear pain and discharge from his left ear. He reports a history of swimming in a lake 2 days ago, after which he developed itching and redness in his ear canal that progressively worsened. On examination, there is erythema and edema of the external auditory canal with purulent discharge. The tympanic membrane is not visible due to swelling of the canal. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Acute otitis media
B. Otitis externa
C. Mastoiditis
D. Cholesteatoma
E. Temporomandibular joint disorder

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with acute otitis externa (AOE), also known as "swimmer's ear." It typically occurs following exposure to water, leading to maceration of the skin lining the external auditory canal, followed by bacterial infection causing inflammation and pain.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with persistent otorrhea for several weeks despite multiple courses of antibiotics prescribed by her primary care physician for presumed otitis externa refractory to treatment. She reports hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and facial weakness on the affected side over the past few days since she noticed blood-tinged drainage from her ear canal along with increased pain and feverishness; however, these symptoms have now resolved spontaneously without any intervention or medication use at home before presenting to your clinic today.
On physical exam, you note granulation tissue protruding through a small perforation in the posterior superior quadrant of her right tympanic membrane associated with an inflamed external auditory meatus filled with debris.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Chronic suppurative otitis media
B. Acute otitis media
C. Otitis externa
D. Cholesteatoma
E. Mastoiditis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's history and physical exam findings are consistent with cholesteatoma, a benign but locally invasive growth of keratinizing squamous epithelium within the middle ear cleft that can lead to progressive hearing loss, vertigo, facial nerve paralysis, and intracranial complications if left untreated.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents with severe pain in his right ear for the past few days after swimming in a public pool during his vacation abroad. He reports itching and discharge from the same ear canal along with mild feverishness and headache; however, these symptoms have now resolved spontaneously without any intervention or medication use at home before presenting to your clinic today.
On examination, you note erythema and edema of the external auditory canal with purulent discharge. There is no tenderness over the mastoid process or lymphadenopathy noted on palpation.
What is the most appropriate initial treatment? 

A. Topical acetic acid drops
B. Oral amoxicillin-clavulanate
C. Intravenous vancomycin
D. Topical corticosteroids
E. Systemic antifungal therapy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with acute otitis externa (AOE), also known as "swimmer's ear." It typically occurs following exposure to water, leading to maceration of the skin lining the external auditory canal, followed by bacterial infection causing inflammation and pain. Initial management involves topical antimicrobial agents such as acetic acid drops to reduce inflammation and control infection while avoiding systemic antibiotics unless there are signs of systemic involvement or immunocompromise present due to potential adverse effects including antibiotic resistance development or superinfection risk associated with their use in AOE.

Question
A 6-year-old boy presents to the GP with a history of recurrent otitis media. He has had multiple episodes in the past year, and his parents are concerned about his hearing. On examination, there is bilateral erythema of the tympanic membranes with effusion present on both sides. The GP suspects that the child may have chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). Which of the following organisms is most commonly associated with CSOM? 

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Haemophilus influenzae 
C. Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
D. Staphylococcus aureus 
E. Moraxella catarrhalis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a persistent inflammation of the middle ear cavity characterized by discharge through a perforated eardrum for more than six weeks. It can be caused by various microorganisms; however, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common pathogens responsible for this condition.

Question
A 2-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with symptoms suggestive of acute otitis media (AOM). She has been irritable and pulling at her left ear for two days, accompanied by fever and decreased appetite. On examination, there is bulging of the left tympanic membrane with loss of landmarks and purulent fluid behind it.

Which of the following antibiotics would be considered first-line treatment for uncomplicated AOM? 

A. Amoxicillin-clavulanate
B. Azithromycin
C. Ceftriaxone
D. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
E. Doxycycline

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended as first-line therapy for uncomplicated AOM in children due to its efficacy against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Azithromycin is an alternative option in penicillin-allergic patients or those who cannot tolerate oral medications.

Question
A 4-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a severe headache and vomiting. His parents report that he has had a history of recurrent otitis media and was recently treated with antibiotics for another episode. On examination, there is tenderness over the mastoid process on the right side, and his neck is stiff.

Which of the following complications of otitis media should be suspected? 

A. Mastoiditis
B. Meningitis 
C. Labyrinthitis 
D. Petrositis 
E. Intracranial abscess

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presentation of this child suggests meningitis as a complication of otitis media, which can occur due to direct extension of infection from the middle ear to the meninges through bony defects or vascular channels. Other potential complications include mastoiditis (infection of the mastoid bone), labyrinthitis (inflammation of the inner ear), petrositis (infection of the temporal bone), and intracranial abscess (collection of pus within brain tissue).

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with abdominal pain and bloating, which she has been experiencing for the past few months. She also reports feeling full quickly when eating and needing to urinate frequently. On examination, there is a palpable mass in her lower abdomen. An ultrasound scan shows a complex ovarian cyst with solid components and irregular borders. The patient undergoes surgery, during which it is discovered that the cyst is malignant and has spread beyond the ovary.
What is the most likely stage of this woman's ovarian cancer? 

A. Stage I
B. Stage II
C. Stage III
D. Stage IV
E. Cannot be determined from the information given

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presence of solid components and irregular borders on imaging suggests an increased risk of malignancy in an ovarian cyst (known as a complex ovarian cyst). Additionally, the fact that the cancer has spread beyond the ovary indicates at least stage III disease.

Question
A 50-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with vague abdominal discomfort and bloating for several weeks. Her CA125 level is elevated, and an ultrasound reveals bilateral adnexal masses suspicious for ovarian cancer. CT scans show no evidence of metastasis or lymphadenopathy elsewhere in the body.
What would be the next step in management? 

A. Immediate surgical intervention
B. Chemotherapy followed by surgery
C. Hormone therapy followed by surgery
D. Radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy 
E. Observation only

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Surgical excision of both ovaries along with any other involved structures should be performed as soon as possible after diagnosis to achieve optimal debulking.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents with fatigue, weight loss, abdominal distension, constipation and urinary frequency over several months duration.She was diagnosed with stage IV serous epithelial carcinoma of the ovary. She underwent debulking surgery and received chemotherapy, but her disease has now progressed. Her CA125 level is elevated, and a CT scan shows multiple liver metastases.
What would be the most appropriate treatment? 

A. Surgery to remove liver metastases
B. Chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
C. Hormone therapy with letrozole
D. Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab
E. Palliative care only

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have relapsed after initial treatment, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care for those who are fit enough to receive it.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue for the past six months. On examination, he has a palpable mass in his abdomen. CT scan reveals a pancreatic head mass with liver metastasis. Biopsy confirms adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
Which of the following is true regarding this patient's prognosis? 

A. The median survival rate for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer is less than six months
B. Patients who undergo surgical resection have a five-year survival rate of more than 50%
C. Chemotherapy is not recommended as it does not improve overall survival rates
D. Radiation therapy alone can cure pancreatic cancer if detected early
E. Palliative care should be initiated immediately

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis, especially when diagnosed at an advanced stage like this patient's case. Surgical resection offers the best chance for long-term survival; however, only about 20% of patients are candidates for surgery due to late diagnosis or metastases at presentation. The median survival rate for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer is approximately six to eight months without treatment and up to one year with chemotherapy and radiation therapy combined.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of persistent upper abdominal pain radiating to her back that worsens after eating fatty foods and alcohol consumption over several weeks. She also reports nausea and vomiting episodes but no significant weight loss or jaundice.
What would be the most appropriate initial investigation? 

A. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
C. Abdominal ultrasound 
D. Computed tomography (CT) scan 
E. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Abdominal ultrasound is the most appropriate initial investigation for suspected pancreatic disease. It can detect gallstones, dilated bile ducts, and pancreatic masses. MRI with MRCP or CT scan may be required if ultrasound findings are inconclusive.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss over several months. On examination, he has a palpable mass in his abdomen. CT scan reveals a pancreatic head mass with liver metastasis. Biopsy confirms adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
What would be the most appropriate treatment? 

A. Surgical resection
B. Chemotherapy alone 
C. Radiation therapy alone 
D. Palliative care only 
E. Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The most appropriate treatment for this patient would be combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy as surgical resection is not possible due to liver metastasis at presentation. Chemotherapy alone or radiation therapy alone have limited efficacy in improving survival rates; however, combining both modalities can improve overall survival rates and provide symptom relief in advanced cases like this one.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a three-month history of fatigue, shortness of breath and easy bruising. She has no significant past medical history but is currently taking oral contraceptives. On examination, she appears pale and there is mild splenomegaly noted on palpation.

A full blood count reveals pancytopenia with the following results:
Hb 8.5 g/dL
Platelets 50 x10^9/L
WCC 1.6 x10^9/L

Further investigations reveal a positive direct Coombs test and elevated LDH levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Myelodysplastic syndrome 
B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria 
C. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
D. Sickle cell anemia 
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is characterized by complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis leading to pancytopenia, thrombosis, and bone marrow failure. The presence of a positive direct Coombs test and elevated LDH levels support this diagnosis.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with a two-month history of night sweats, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. Clinical examination reveals hepatosplenomegaly without any other significant findings.

A full blood count shows pancytopenia with the following results:
Hb 7 g/dL
Platelets 30 x10^9/L
WCC 1 x10^9/L

Bone marrow biopsy reveals hypocellular marrow with fibrosis.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Myelodysplastic syndrome 
B. Aplastic anemia 
C. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
D. Primary myelofibrosis 
E. Acute myeloid leukemia 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with primary myelofibrosis, which is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis leading to pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly. Hypocellular marrow on biopsy supports this diagnosis.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to her GP with a one-month history of fatigue, shortness of breath, and easy bruising. She has no significant past medical history but recently completed chemotherapy for breast cancer.

A full blood count reveals pancytopenia with the following results:
Hb 9 g/dL
Platelets 40 x10^9/L
WCC 1 x10^9/L

Further investigations reveal a positive direct Coombs test and low haptoglobin levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Myelodysplastic syndrome 
B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria 
C. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
D. Chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression 
E. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia 

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), which can be drug-induced or idiopathic and leads to immune-mediated destruction of red blood cells resulting in pancytopenia. The presence of a positive direct Coombs test and low haptoglobin levels support this diagnosis, while recent chemotherapy may have triggered AIHA in this case.

Question
A 70-year-old male patient presents to the neurology clinic with a history of tremors, stiffness, and difficulty in initiating movements for the past two years. He also reports experiencing constipation and loss of smell sensation. On examination, he has bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, and resting tremor. His cognitive function is intact, but he has mild depression. The patient's MRI scan shows no abnormalities.
Which of the following medications would be most appropriate as an initial treatment for this patient? 

A. Levodopa
B. Pramipexole
C. Selegiline
D. Amantadine 
E. Rasagiline

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This question tests the candidate's knowledge on the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). In early PD patients without significant motor complications or dementia, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors such as rasagiline are recommended as first-line therapy along with non-pharmacological interventions like exercise and physiotherapy.

Question
A 60-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of tremors in her right hand that have been progressively worsening over six months. She also reports feeling fatigued and having difficulty sleeping at night due to frequent muscle cramps in both legs. Her medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she takes lisinopril and simvastatin respectively.
On examination, she has a resting tremor in her right hand that disappears during movement; there is no rigidity or bradykinesia noted on clinical assessment.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Essential tremor 
B. Drug-induced parkinsonism 
C. Multiple system atrophy 
D. Corticobasal degeneration 
E. Progressive supranuclear palsy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This question assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between essential tremor and parkinsonism. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder characterized by postural or kinetic tremors that are usually bilateral, symmetrical, and involve the upper limbs. Unlike Parkinson's disease, there is no rigidity or bradykinesia in essential tremor.

Question
A 72-year-old male patient with a history of Parkinson's disease presents to the emergency department with complaints of fever, cough, and shortness of breath for three days. He has been taking levodopa-carbidopa therapy for the past five years.
On examination, he appears lethargic and disoriented with a temperature of 38.5°C. His oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pneumonia 
B. Pulmonary embolism 
C. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
D. Aspiration pneumonitis
E. Levodopa-induced dyskinesia

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This question tests the candidate's knowledge on the management of infections in patients with PD who are on dopaminergic medications such as levodopa-carbidopa therapy. Patients with PD are at increased risk of developing pneumonia due to impaired swallowing function and reduced respiratory muscle strength; hence it should be considered as a potential cause of acute worsening in their clinical condition when they present with respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath along with fever.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe pain in his right hip after a minor fall at home. He has a history of prostate cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. On examination, there is tenderness over the right hip joint, and an X-ray shows a displaced fracture of the femoral neck.

A. Administer unfractionated heparin
B. Administer enoxaparin
C. Withhold warfarin and administer dabigatran
D. Continue warfarin at current dose 
E. Administer aspirin only

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In patients with acute MI and AF who are already taking oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, initial treatment should include parenteral anticoagulation such as unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins until the INR falls below 2.0-2.5 to prevent further thrombus formation in the coronary arteries.

Question
A 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and previous myocardial infarction presents to the emergency department with chest pain radiating to his left arm. An ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads and he is diagnosed with an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI). He undergoes primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stenting of the right coronary artery. He is started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.

Which one of the following statements regarding antiplatelet therapy after PCI is true? 

A. Dual antiplatelet therapy should be continued for at least 6 months
B. Aspirin monotherapy should be initiated after 1 month
C. Clopidogrel monotherapy should be initiated after 3 months
D. Ticagrelor should be added to aspirin after 12 months
E. Prasugrel should be used instead of clopidogrel in this patient

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In patients undergoing PCI, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor is recommended for at least 6 months to reduce the risk of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). After 6 months, continuation of DAPT may be considered based on individual patient factors such as bleeding risk.

Question
A 58-year-old woman presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of transient ischemic attack (TIA) over the past week despite being on aspirin for secondary prevention of stroke due to prior ischemic stroke.

Management should include resuscitation with intravenous fluids and blood transfusion if necessary followed by prompt endoscopic evaluation within 24 hours of admission to identify the source of bleeding and perform therapeutic interventions such as injection therapy, thermal coagulation or clipping.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of recurrent abdominal pain that improves after eating but worsens when she skips meals or eats spicy food or coffee. She also reports nausea, bloating and early satiety for several months now despite taking over-the-counter antacids regularly without relief.
Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be most appropriate? 

A. Fecal occult blood test
B. Serum gastrin levels
C. Stool antigen test for H.pylori
D. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
E. Barium swallow

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, which can be diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy that allows visualization of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum for mucosal abnormalities such as ulcers, erosions or inflammation. Other diagnostic tests include stool antigen test for H.pylori infection, serum gastrin levels to rule out Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, fecal occult blood test to detect bleeding and barium swallow to assess motility disorders.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of recurrent epigastric pain that is relieved by antacids but recurs after meals or when lying down at night. He has a history of asthma and takes inhaled corticosteroids regularly. On examination, he appears well with no signs of distress or dehydration. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the epigastrium without guarding or rebound tenderness.
Which one of the following medications should be avoided? 

A. Omeprazole
B. Ranitidine
C. Misoprostol
D. Sucralfate 
E. Cimetidine

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can be treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole or lansoprazole that reduce gastric acid secretion by irreversibly blocking the hydrogen-potassium ATPase enzyme on parietal cells' apical membrane surface leading to healing of esophagitis and prevention of complications such as strictures or Barrett's esophagus. However, ranitidine is an H2 receptor antagonist that blocks histamine-mediated stimulation of gastric acid secretion but may cause drug interactions with inhaled corticosteroids by inhibiting their metabolism leading to increased systemic exposure and adverse effects such as adrenal suppression or osteoporosis. Therefore, PPIs are preferred over H2 receptor antagonists in patients with GERD who require concomitant corticosteroid therapy.

Question
A 42-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe pain and swelling in the perianal region.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents with vaginal bleeding at 32 weeks of gestation. She has a history of two previous Caesarean sections and is now diagnosed with placenta praevia on ultrasound scan. The obstetric team discusses the management options with her, including the possibility of conservative management or delivery by Caesarean section. They explain that there are risks associated with both approaches, including maternal haemorrhage, fetal distress, and premature birth.

Which one of the following factors would favour conservative management over immediate delivery by Caesarean section in this patient? 

A. Maternal age
B. Gestational age
C. Number of previous Caesarean sections
D. Size of the placental lacunae
E. Presence of uterine contractions

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The size and depth of the placental lacunae can be used to predict the risk of massive haemorrhage during Caesarean section for placenta praevia. If the lacunae are small and superficial, conservative management may be considered until fetal lung maturity is achieved or until spontaneous labour occurs.

Question
A 29-year-old primigravida presents at 36 weeks' gestation with painless vaginal bleeding. Ultrasound scan reveals a low-lying posterior placenta that partially covers the internal os but does not extend beyond it (grade II anterior placenta praevia). She is admitted to hospital for observation and monitoring.

Which one of the following interventions should be avoided in this patient? 

A. Digital vaginal examination
B. Transvaginal ultrasound scan
C. Fetal scalp electrode placement 
D. Induction of labour 
E. Administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In patients with grade II anterior placenta praevia, digital vaginal examination should be avoided to prevent disruption of the placenta and subsequent haemorrhage. Transvaginal ultrasound scan, fetal scalp electrode placement, induction of labour, and administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation may be considered if clinically indicated.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents at 34 weeks' gestation with heavy vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. She has a history of two previous Caesarean sections and is diagnosed with placenta praevia on ultrasound scan. The obstetric team decides to proceed with an emergency Caesarean section due to maternal instability and fetal distress.

Which one of the following surgical techniques would be most appropriate in this patient? 

A. Classical uterine incision
B. Low transverse uterine incision
C. Vertical midline uterine incision 
D. T-shaped uterine incision 
E. J-shaped uterine incision

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients with placenta praevia who require Caesarean section, a vertical midline uterine incision may be preferred over a low transverse or classical incision due to the risk of massive haemorrhage from the lower segment of the uterus during delivery. A T-shaped or J-shaped incision may also be used in selected cases where there is significant anterior or posterior placental invasion.

Question
A 34-year-old woman presents at 36 weeks of gestation with vaginal bleeding and severe abdominal pain. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous caesarean section. On examination, her uterus is tender and tense with fetal distress noted on cardiotocography. Her blood pressure is elevated at 160/100 mmHg, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95%. An ultrasound shows an abnormal placental location with retroplacental clot formation. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Placenta praevia
B. Placental abruption
C. Uterine rupture
D. Placenta accreta
E. Vasa previa

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests placental abruption due to the presence of vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, uterine tenderness and tension, fetal distress on cardiotocography, and retroplacental clot formation on ultrasound imaging.

Question
A 29-year-old primigravida presents at term with sudden onset vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain after a minor trauma from falling down stairs. She reports no significant medical or obstetric history but admits to smoking during pregnancy despite counseling against it by her healthcare provider.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Placenta praevia 
B. Abruptio placentae 
C.Uterine rupture 
D.Placenta accreta 
E.Vasa previa

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests abruptio placentae due to the presence of sudden onset vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain after minor trauma, although fetal distress is absent.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents at 34 weeks of gestation with a history of recurrent episodes of vaginal bleeding over the past few weeks. She has no significant medical or obstetric history but reports having had multiple sexual partners during her pregnancy without using any contraception. On examination, there are no signs of uterine tenderness or contractions noted on cardiotocography; however, ultrasound imaging shows an abnormal placental location with evidence of retroplacental hematoma formation. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Placenta praevia 
B.Abruptio placentae 
C.Uterine rupture 
D.Placenta accreta 
E.Vasa previa

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests abruptio placentae due to the presence of recurrent episodes of vaginal bleeding and retroplacental hematoma formation on ultrasound imaging despite the absence of uterine tenderness or contractions noted on cardiotocography.

Question
A 56-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a one-week history of fever, cough and shortness of breath. He has a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension. On examination, he appears unwell, is tachypnoeic at 28 breaths per minute and his oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral crepitations.
A chest X-ray shows patchy opacities in both lung fields consistent with pneumonia. The patient is started on empirical antibiotics and nebulisers for COPD exacerbation.
On day three of admission, the patient's temperature spikes to 39°C and his white cell count rises from 12 x10^9/L to 18 x10^9/L. Blood cultures are taken which grow gram-positive cocci in chains after two days.
Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for this patient's pneumonia? 

A. Streptococcus pyogenes
B. Staphylococcus aureus
C. Klebsiella pneumoniae
D. Streptococcus pneumoniae
E. Haemophilus influenzae

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of gram-positive cocci in chains suggests that the organism causing the infection is a streptococcus species such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). However, given that the patient has been receiving antibiotics since admission, it is more likely that this represents an antibiotic-resistant strain such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Question
A previously healthy 25-year-old female presents to her GP with a four-day history of fever, productive cough and pleuritic chest pain radiating to her back. She denies any recent travel or sick contacts. On examination, her temperature is 38.5°C and there are decreased breath sounds at the right lung base with dullness to percussion.
A chest X-ray shows a large right-sided pleural effusion with associated consolidation of the lower lobe. A diagnostic thoracentesis is performed which reveals frank pus on aspiration.
Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for this patient's pneumonia? 

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Staphylococcus aureus
C. Klebsiella pneumoniae
D. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
E. Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presence of frank pus in the pleural fluid suggests that this is an empyema rather than a simple parapneumonic effusion. Empyemas are usually caused by more virulent organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus or anaerobes.

Question
An 80-year-old male resident of a nursing home presents to hospital with confusion and worsening shortness of breath over the past two days. He has a history of dementia, hypertension and previous strokes but no known respiratory disease or recent travel history.

Explanation: MRI is more sensitive than X-ray or ultrasound in detecting inflammation around joints and soft tissues, making it useful in confirming a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica when other investigations are inconclusive.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents to the labour ward at term in her second pregnancy with a history of previous postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) after vaginal delivery. She has had an uneventful antenatal period, and there is no evidence of fetal distress on admission. After an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, she experiences excessive blood loss from the genital tract within one hour of delivery. The midwife estimates that she has lost approximately 1000 ml of blood. On examination, her uterus is firm and contracted, but there are clots present in the vagina. What is the most likely cause of this patient's PPH? 

A. Uterine inversion
B. Coagulopathy 
C. Cervical laceration
D. Vaginal hematoma
E. Placenta accreta

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Placenta accreta occurs when the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall, leading to difficulty separating it during delivery and subsequent bleeding due to incomplete separation or damage to surrounding tissues during removal attempts. Women with a history of previous PPH are at increased risk for placenta accreta in subsequent pregnancies.

Question
A 25-year-old primigravida presents at 38 weeks' gestation with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding consistent with preterm labour and suspected placental abruption based on clinical signs and symptoms. She receives appropriate management including corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity before delivering vaginally under general anaesthesia due to severe maternal hypotension secondary to massive blood loss estimated at over 2000 ml within two hours post-delivery despite active management of third stage labour using oxytocin infusion and manual removal of retained products under ultrasound guidance by experienced obstetricians.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's postpartum haemorrhage? 

A. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
B. Uterine atony
C. Placenta accreta 
D. Cervical laceration
E. Vaginal hematoma

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: DIC is a serious complication of obstetric haemorrhage that can occur due to the release of tissue factor and other procoagulant substances into the circulation, leading to widespread activation of the clotting cascade and consumption of platelets and clotting factors. It is associated with poor maternal outcomes including multi-organ failure, bleeding complications, and death.

Question
A 29-year-old woman presents in early labour at term with a history of previous caesarean section for fetal distress in her first pregnancy. She has no significant medical or surgical history and takes no regular medications. After an uncomplicated vaginal delivery under epidural anaesthesia, she experiences excessive blood loss from the genital tract within two hours post-delivery despite active management of third stage labour using oxytocin infusion and manual removal of retained products under ultrasound guidance by experienced obstetricians.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's postpartum haemorrhage? 

A. Uterine rupture
B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
C. Retained placenta 
D. Cervical laceration
E. Uterine atony

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Uterine atony is a common cause of PPH after vaginal delivery and occurs when the uterus fails to contract adequately after delivery, leading to persistent bleeding from the placental bed or uterine vessels that were previously occluded during pregnancy by compression from the growing fetus and its supporting structures such as membranes and amniotic fluid. Women with a history of previous caesarean section are at increased risk for uterine atony due to the potential for uterine scarring and impaired contractility.

Question
A 35-year-old pregnant woman with a BMI of 30 presents to the antenatal clinic at 20 weeks gestation for her routine check-up. She has no significant medical history and is taking no medications. Her blood pressure (BP) is 140/90 mmHg, which is higher than her previous readings. Urine dipstick shows proteinuria +++. The midwife suspects pre-eclampsia and refers her to the obstetrician.
Which of the following tests should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis? 

A. Serum creatinine
B. Liver function tests
C. Platelet count
D. Coagulation profile
E. All of the above

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed when there is hypertension (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart after 20 weeks' gestation in a previously normotensive woman) and proteinuria (≥300 mg/24 h or urine dipstick ≥1+) or other maternal organ dysfunction such as renal insufficiency, liver involvement, neurological complications, haematological abnormalities, or uteroplacental dysfunction.

Question
A 25-year-old primigravida presents at 36 weeks gestation with severe headache, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain that started suddenly an hour ago. On examination, she has a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg and mild oedema in both lower limbs.
What is the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Deliver by emergency caesarean section
B. Administer magnesium sulphate
C. Start intravenous labetalol infusion
D. Perform urgent fetal monitoring 
E. Admit for observation only

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's symptoms suggest severe pre-eclampsia, which is a medical emergency. The initial management of severe pre-eclampsia includes administering magnesium sulphate to prevent seizures and stabilise the blood pressure. Delivery may be indicated if there are signs of fetal compromise or maternal deterioration.

Question
A 30-year-old pregnant woman with gestational hypertension presents at 32 weeks gestation for her routine antenatal check-up. She has no significant medical history and is taking no medications. Her blood pressure (BP) is 150/100 mmHg, which is higher than her previous readings. Urine dipstick shows proteinuria ++. 
Which of the following medications should be started? 

A. Low dose aspirin
B. Intravenous hydralazine
C. Oral nifedipine
D. Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate
E. None of the above

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Gestational hypertension is defined as new-onset hypertension (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg on two occasions at least four hours apart after 20 weeks' gestation in a previously normotensive woman) without proteinuria or other maternal organ dysfunction such as renal insufficiency, liver involvement, neurological complications, haematological abnormalities, or uteroplacental dysfunction.
The first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate gestational hypertension is oral nifedipine to lower the blood pressure and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes such as pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction.

A. Administering systemic antibiotics
B. Recommending surgical debridement
C. Providing regular repositioning every two hours
D. Referring to plastic surgery for flap reconstruction
E. Prescribing opioid analgesics

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Surgical debridement may be necessary to remove necrotic tissue and prevent further damage in cases where there is exposed bone or tendon present in the wound bed.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of urinary frequency, urgency and nocturia for the past six months. He has no significant medical history but reports that his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 70. On examination, digital rectal examination reveals an enlarged prostate gland with a palpable nodule on the right lobe. PSA level is elevated at 12 ng/mL. The patient undergoes transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy which confirms adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland with a Gleason score of 8.

Which one of the following is true regarding this patient's prognosis? 

A. The patient has a high risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy
B. The patient's life expectancy will not be affected by this diagnosis
C. The patient should receive active surveillance as initial management
D. The patient should receive radiation therapy alone as definitive treatment
E. Hormonal therapy alone is sufficient in managing this patient's disease

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Patients with higher Gleason scores are associated with more aggressive tumours and have poorer outcomes compared to those with lower scores. Radical prostatectomy may be recommended for patients who have clinically localized disease and good performance status, however, patients with high-risk features such as high Gleason score are at increased risk of recurrence even after surgery.

Question
A 75-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of back pain and difficulty walking for several weeks. He also reports urinary symptoms including hesitancy, dribbling and incomplete emptying for the past year but did not seek medical attention earlier due to embarrassment. Digital rectal examination reveals an enlarged, firm prostate gland without nodules or tenderness.

Which one of the following investigations would provide additional information? 

A. CT scan abdomen and pelvis 
B. Bone scan 
C. MRI brain 
D. PET-CT scan 
E. Serum calcium level 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of advanced prostate cancer with possible bone metastases. A bone scan is the most appropriate investigation to confirm the presence and extent of bony involvement.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his GP for routine follow-up after being diagnosed with prostate cancer two years ago. He underwent radical prostatectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and has been on active surveillance since then. His PSA level has been stable at <0.1 ng/mL over the past year, but he reports new onset urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.

Which one of the following interventions would be most appropriate? 

A. Referral for penile prosthesis implantation
B. Initiation of phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor therapy
C. Pelvic floor muscle exercises
D. Urethral sling placement 
E. Artificial urinary sphincter insertion

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Urinary incontinence is a common complication following radical prostatectomy, however, it may improve over time with pelvic floor muscle exercises which strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and urethra. Penile prosthesis implantation, PDE-5 inhibitors, urethral sling placement or artificial urinary sphincter insertion are not indicated for this patient's current presentation as they do not address his primary concern of urinary incontinence.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to her GP with a history of chronic plaque psoriasis for the past 10 years. She has been on topical treatments and phototherapy but has not achieved complete remission. On examination, there are erythematous scaly plaques on her scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. The patient is concerned about the impact of psoriasis on her quality of life.

Which one of the following systemic medications would be most appropriate for this patient?

A. Cyclosporine
B. Etanercept
C. Methotrexate
D. Ustekinumab
E. Secukinumab

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In patients who have failed topical therapy or phototherapy, systemic therapies such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, etanercept, ustekinumab or secukinumab may be considered depending on individual factors such as disease severity and comorbidities. In this case, ustekinumab is an appropriate choice due to its efficacy in treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and its favorable safety profile.

Question
A 28-year-old male presents to his dermatologist with new onset guttate psoriasis after a recent streptococcal throat infection. He has multiple small erythematous papules with fine scales over his trunk and limbs that appeared suddenly within the last two weeks.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? 

A. Topical corticosteroids 
B. Phototherapy 
C. Oral antibiotics 
D. Systemic corticosteroids 
E. Topical calcipotriol 

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Guttate psoriasis often follows a streptococcal pharyngitis infection and can resolve spontaneously within several months without treatment; however, in some cases, it may progress to chronic plaque psoriasis. In this case, oral antibiotics such as penicillin or erythromycin are the first-line treatment to eradicate any remaining streptococcal infection and prevent recurrent episodes.

Question
A 50-year-old female presents with a history of severe palmoplantar psoriasis that has not responded to topical treatments or phototherapy. She reports significant functional impairment due to pain and difficulty walking.

Which one of the following systemic medications is most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Methotrexate 
B. Cyclosporine 
C. Ustekinumab 
D. Secukinumab 
E. Adalimumab

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Palmoplantar psoriasis can be difficult to treat with topical agents alone and may require systemic therapy in severe cases. Cyclosporine is an effective option for patients with moderate-to-severe palmoplantar psoriasis who have failed other therapies due to its rapid onset of action and high efficacy rates; however, monitoring for potential side effects such as hypertension and renal dysfunction is necessary during treatment.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. On examination, he is tachycardic and hypotensive. A CT pulmonary angiogram confirms a diagnosis of massive pulmonary embolism.

What is the most appropriate initial management for this patient? What are the potential complications? How can these be prevented? 

A. Administer thrombolytic therapy
B. Perform surgical embolectomy
C. Initiate anticoagulation therapy
D. Insert an inferior vena cava filter
E. Transfer to a tertiary care center

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Thrombolytic therapy is the most appropriate initial management for patients with massive pulmonary embolism who are hemodynamically unstable or have evidence of right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography or CT scan. The potential complications include bleeding, reperfusion injury, and recurrent thromboembolism. These can be prevented by careful patient selection, dosing based on weight and renal function, monitoring for signs of bleeding or allergic reactions, and avoiding concomitant use of anticoagulants.

Question
A 40-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of increasing dyspnea on exertion over the past few weeks. She denies any chest pain or cough but reports occasional palpitations and lightheadedness when climbing stairs or walking uphill.

On physical examination, she appears comfortable at rest but desaturates to 88% on room air after walking up one flight of stairs. There is no peripheral edema or cyanosis noted.

What is the most likely diagnosis? What additional investigations would you order? 

A. Pulmonary embolism; D-dimer test followed by CTPA if positive
B. Pulmonary hypertension; echocardiogram and right heart catheterization
C. Asthma exacerbation; spirometry and bronchodilator challenge test
D. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests
E. Interstitial lung disease; high-resolution CT scan of the chest

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is pulmonary hypertension, which can present with dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, and lightheadedness. Additional investigations would include an echocardiogram to assess for elevated pulmonary artery pressures and right ventricular dysfunction, as well as a right heart catheterization to confirm the diagnosis and measure hemodynamic parameters.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. He has a past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and recent surgery for colon cancer.

On examination, he appears anxious and tachypneic with decreased breath sounds over the left lower lung field. A D-dimer test is positive but a subsequent CTPA is negative for pulmonary embolism.

What other diagnoses should be considered? What further investigations would you order? 

A. Pneumothorax; bedside ultrasound or chest X-ray
B. Acute coronary syndrome; ECG and cardiac enzymes
C. Pericarditis; echocardiogram
D. Pleural effusion; thoracentesis or ultrasound-guided drainage
E. Pulmonary fibrosis; high-resolution CT scan of the chest

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Although a negative CTPA effectively rules out pulmonary embolism in most cases, other diagnoses such as pneumothorax should still be considered if there are clinical features suggestive of this condition such as decreased breath sounds or subcutaneous emphysema. Further investigations would include a bedside ultrasound or chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.

Explanation: Although surgical treatment for pyloric stenosis is highly effective, it carries a risk of developing adhesions between organs or tissues within the abdominal cavity leading to bowel obstruction in later life.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of severe back pain and weakness in both legs for the past week. He reports that he has been experiencing numbness and tingling sensations in his feet for several months, which have progressively worsened over time. On examination, you note muscle wasting in both lower limbs, reduced power on hip flexion and knee extension bilaterally, and absent ankle reflexes. Sensory testing reveals loss of sensation below the level of L4 dermatome bilaterally.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Lumbar spinal stenosis
B. Guillain-Barré syndrome
C. Multiple sclerosis 
D. Diabetic neuropathy 
E. Acute transverse myelitis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with lumbar spinal stenosis, which is characterized by compression of nerve roots within the spinal canal leading to neurogenic claudication (pain or discomfort in the legs while walking), sensory disturbances, motor weakness, and bladder/bowel dysfunction.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of persistent low back pain radiating down her left leg for the past two weeks. She reports that she has difficulty standing up from a seated position due to pain and stiffness in her lower back region. On examination, there is tenderness over the left sacroiliac joint with limited range of motion on forward bending test but no neurological deficits noted.

Which one of the following investigations would be most useful? 

A. MRI scan of lumbar spine
B. X-ray pelvis
C. CT scan abdomen/pelvis
D. Bone scan
E. Ultrasound sacroiliac joints

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests sacroiliitis as a possible cause for her symptoms; therefore an ultrasound scan of the sacroiliac joints would be most useful in this scenario. MRI scan is more sensitive and specific but ultrasound can provide a quick, non-invasive assessment of the joint space, soft tissue swelling, and fluid accumulation.

Question
A 60-year-old man presents to his GP with complaints of severe pain in his right leg that started suddenly while he was walking down the stairs at home. He reports that the pain is sharp and shooting in nature and radiates from his lower back down to his foot. On examination, there is tenderness over the L5-S1 region with reduced power on ankle dorsiflexion and absent ankle reflexes on the right side.

Which one of the following investigations should be performed? 

A. Plain X-ray lumbar spine
B. CT scan abdomen/pelvis
C. MRI scan lumbar spine
D. Electromyography (EMG)
E. Nerve conduction studies

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests an acute onset of radiculopathy involving the L5-S1 nerve roots; therefore an MRI scan of the lumbar spine would be most appropriate for further evaluation as it provides detailed information about spinal cord compression, disc herniation or stenosis which may require surgical intervention if necessary.

Question
A 35-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a severe headache, vomiting and confusion. She has a history of hypertension and is currently on antihypertensive medication. On examination, she is drowsy but arousable to voice commands. Her blood pressure is elevated at 180/100 mmHg, pulse rate is 90 beats per minute and respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. Fundoscopy reveals papilloedema bilaterally.

Which one of the following statements regarding raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in this patient is true? 

A. Intracranial pressure monitoring should be performed immediately
B. Lumbar puncture should be performed to rule out meningitis
C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan should be done urgently
D. Mannitol infusion should be initiated immediately
E. Hyperventilation should be avoided

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests that the patient may have raised ICP due to cerebral oedema or an intracranial mass lesion such as a tumour or haematoma causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Papilloedema indicates chronic elevation of ICP and requires urgent management to prevent permanent visual loss. Intracranial pressure monitoring allows continuous measurement of ICP and helps guide therapy for patients with suspected raised ICP.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents with altered mental status after being involved in a motor vehicle accident where he sustained head trauma. He was intubated at the scene due to decreased level of consciousness and transferred to the hospital for further management.
On arrival, his Glasgow Coma Scale score is E1V1M4, blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, heart rate is 110 beats per minute and respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute with mechanical ventilation.
What would be the most appropriate initial management? 

A. Administer hypertonic saline
B. Initiate hyperventilation to decrease intracranial pressure
C. Perform a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head
D. Insert an external ventricular drain for cerebrospinal fluid drainage
E. Transfer patient to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient has sustained significant head trauma and is at risk of developing raised ICP, which can lead to cerebral herniation and death if not managed promptly. A non-contrast CT scan of the head should be performed urgently to assess for any intracranial haemorrhage or mass lesion that may require surgical intervention.

Question
A 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension presents with sudden onset severe headache, vomiting and confusion. On examination, he is drowsy but arousable to voice commands, blood pressure is elevated at 180/100 mmHg and pulse rate is 90 beats per minute.
Which one of the following interventions would be contraindicated in this patient? 

A. Hyperventilation
B. Mannitol infusion
C. External ventricular drain insertion 
D. Sedation with propofol 
E. Surgical decompression

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Hyperventilation causes vasoconstriction leading to decreased cerebral blood flow and decreased ICP; however, it also leads to hypocapnia causing cerebral vasoconstriction and worsening brain ischemia in patients with traumatic brain injury or stroke who have impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow due to damaged vascular endothelium or disrupted neuronal signalling pathways. In patients with suspected raised ICP from other causes such as intracranial haemorrhage or tumour, hyperventilation may cause rebound increase in ICP due to vasodilatation and increased cerebral blood flow. Therefore, hyperventilation should be avoided in patients with suspected raised ICP unless there is evidence of impending herniation.

Question
A 25-year-old male presents to the clinic with a 2-month history of recurrent episodes of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. He reports no personal or family history of rheumatological conditions and has never had any sexually transmitted infections either. On examination, he has bilateral conjunctivitis and mild swelling in his left knee joint. His urine analysis shows leukocytes but no bacteria or red blood cells. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Reactive arthritis
B. Rheumatoid arthritis 
C. Psoriatic arthritis
D. Ankylosing spondylitis
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), which typically follows an infection elsewhere in the body such as a gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or other organisms like Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia etc., although no specific organism can be identified in up to half of cases.

Question
A 30-year-old female presents with pain and stiffness in her right ankle for the last 4 weeks following an episode of gastroenteritis that resolved spontaneously without antibiotics treatment two weeks before onset of joint symptoms. She also complains of lower back pain that started at the same time as her ankle pain; however, she denies any urogenital symptoms or skin rash/lesions on examiniation.. Her physical examination reveals tenderness over her right Achilles tendon insertion site along with limited dorsiflexion range of motion at both ankles and sacroiliac joints tenderness upon palpation bilaterally.What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Reactive arthritis
B. Gout 
C. Osteoarthritis 
D. Septic Arthritis 
E.Rheumatoid Arthritis 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with reactive arthritis, which typically follows an infection elsewhere in the body such as a gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or other organisms like Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia etc. The presence of sacroiliac joint tenderness and limited range of motion at both ankles suggests involvement of axial skeleton and peripheral joints respectively.

Question
A 40-year-old male presents to the clinic with a history of recurrent episodes of painful swelling in his right knee for the last 6 months. He reports no personal or family history of rheumatological conditions and has never had any sexually transmitted infections either. On examination, there is moderate effusion in his right knee with mild synovitis but no erythema or warmth overlying the joint. His blood tests show elevated ESR and CRP levels along with negative serology for Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies? What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Reactive arthritis
B. Gout 
C. Osteoarthritis 
D. Septic Arthritis 
E.Rheumatoid Arthritis 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with reactive arthritis, which typically follows an infection elsewhere in the body such as a gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or other organisms like Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia etc., although no specific organism can be identified in up to half of cases.The absence of RF/anti-CCP antibodies rules out RA as a possible diagnosis while raised inflammatory markers suggest ongoing inflammation within the affected joint(s).

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents to the Emergency Department with severe shortness of breath and cyanosis. He is found to be in respiratory arrest, and chest compressions are commenced immediately by the attending staff. The patient's oxygen saturation remains low despite bag-valve-mask ventilation, and advanced airway management is initiated. However, due to the severity of his COPD, traditional intubation methods prove difficult. Which of the following alternative airway devices would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Laryngeal mask airway
B. Endotracheal tube introducer
C. Esophageal obturator airway
D. Retrograde wire-guided intubation 
E. Cricothyroidotomy

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In patients with severe COPD who require emergency airway management, cricothyroidotomy may be necessary when traditional intubation methods fail or are contraindicated due to increased risk of complications such as barotrauma or pneumothorax.

Question
A 25-year-old female presents to the Emergency Department after being found unresponsive at home by her family members. She has a history of asthma and was recently prescribed a new medication for depression that she has been taking for two weeks now. On arrival, she is noted to have absent breath sounds on auscultation and no detectable pulse on palpation. Chest compressions are started immediately, and an automated external defibrillator (AED) is attached which advises one shock followed by resumption of chest compressions. What should be done next? 

A. Administer adrenaline 
B. Intubate the patient 
C. Check for reversible causes 
D. Perform needle decompression 
E. Administer amiodarone 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: After the initial shock, advanced airway management should be initiated to optimize oxygenation and ventilation. Intubation is preferred over bag-valve-mask ventilation in cardiac arrest patients as it provides more reliable tidal volumes and reduces the risk of gastric insufflation.

Question
A 60-year-old man with a history of smoking presents to his primary care physician complaining of shortness of breath and coughing up blood for several weeks. He is referred for further evaluation, which includes a chest X-ray that shows a mass in his right lung. Biopsy confirms non-small cell lung cancer, and he undergoes surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite treatment, he develops respiratory failure due to tumor progression and requires mechanical ventilation. Which mode of mechanical ventilation would be most appropriate? 

A. Pressure-controlled ventilation 
B. Volume-controlled ventilation 
C. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation 
D. Airway pressure release ventilation 
E. Proportional assist ventilation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with respiratory failure due to lung cancer, volume-controlled mechanical ventilation is preferred over pressure-controlled modes as it allows for better control of tidal volume delivery and minimizes the risk of barotrauma or pneumothorax associated with high peak inspiratory pressures seen in pressure-controlled modes such as pressure support or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

Question
A 72-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency department with severe dyspnoea and hypoxia. On examination, he is tachypneic with an RR of 35/min and SaO2 of 80% on air. An arterial blood gas reveals pH of 7.25, pCO2 of 12 kPa, pO2 of 6 kPa and HCO3- of 30 mmol/L. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. The patient is started on non-invasive ventilation but continues to deteriorate requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

What is the most likely cause of respiratory failure in this patient? 

A. Type 4 respiratory failure
B. Type 5 respiratory failure
C. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
D. Pulmonary Embolism 
E. Chronic Hypoxic Respiratory Failure

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with ARDS which can occur as a result of pneumonia or other causes such as sepsis or trauma. ARDS is characterised by diffuse alveolar damage leading to increased permeability, pulmonary oedema and decreased lung compliance resulting in severe hypoxemia that may require mechanical ventilation.

Question

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Type 1 respiratory failure
B. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
C. COVID-19 pneumonia 
D. Pulmonary Embolism 
E. Asthma exacerbation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient's presentation is consistent with ARDS which can occur as a result of severe viral infections such as COVID-19, leading to diffuse alveolar damage resulting in severe hypoxemia that may require mechanical ventilation.

Question
A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath and cough productive of yellow sputum for two weeks.He has a history of COPD and hypertension.On examination,his RR=28/min,SaO2=88% on room air,and he has decreased breath sounds at the right lung base.Chest X-ray reveals consolidation in the right lower lobe.Blood tests show elevated white cell count,lactate dehydrogenase,and C-reactive protein levels.Pleural fluid analysis reveals exudative effusion with high neutrophil count.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation? 

A. Congestive heart failure
B. Chronic Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
C. Pneumonia 
D. Tuberculosis
E. Parapneumonic effusion

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features are suggestive of parapneumonic effusion which occurs due to accumulation of inflammatory fluid adjacent to or within the lung parenchyma as a result of bacterial pneumonia or other infectious causes.The presence of an exudative pleural effusion with high neutrophil count suggests an active infection requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics and possible drainage if necessary.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with a sudden onset of visual loss in his left eye, describing the sensation of a 'curtain' coming from the superior side towards the centre. He also reports seeing flashes of lights and an increase in the number of floaters in his left eye.
On examination, his vision is 6/9 in the right eye and 6/60 in the left eye. Fundoscopy reveals a retinal tear at the superior aspect of the retina.

Which one of the following statements regarding retinal detachment is true? 

A. The most common cause of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is posterior vitreous detachment.
B. Tractional retinal detachment occurs due to fibrovascular proliferation on the surface of the retina.
C. Exudative retinal detachment typically presents with acute onset symptoms and requires urgent surgical intervention.
D. Retinal detachments are more commonly seen in patients with high myopia or previous ocular surgery.
E. Scleral buckling is not effective for treating large or complicated retinal detachments.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs when there is a break (tear or hole) in the retina that allows fluid to pass through and accumulate under it, causing separation from its underlying pigment epithelium layer. Posterior vitreous detachment can lead to this type of retinal detachment but it's not always present as some tears may occur spontaneously without any preceding event. Tractional retinal detachment occurs due to fibrovascular proliferation on the surface of the retina, usually seen in diabetic patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or other ischemic conditions such as sickle cell disease or vein occlusions. Exudative retinal detachments typically present with gradual onset symptoms and are caused by accumulation of subretinal fluid due to leakage from abnormal blood vessels or inflammation/infection. They are usually managed conservatively or with laser therapy, and surgical intervention is rarely required. Retinal detachments are more commonly seen in patients with high myopia or previous ocular surgery due to changes in the shape of the eye or weakening of the retina from surgical trauma. Scleral buckling is a common technique used for treating retinal detachments, especially those involving the peripheral retina or complicated cases where vitrectomy may not be feasible.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with sudden onset visual loss in her right eye associated with flashes of lights and floaters. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of retinal detachment in her father.
On examination, her vision is 6/9 in the right eye and 6/6 in the left eye. Fundoscopy reveals a horseshoe tear at the inferior aspect of the retina.

Which one of the following statements regarding management of this patient's condition is true? 

A. Laser photocoagulation should be performed immediately to seal off the tear and prevent progression to retinal detachment.
B. Vitrectomy with gas tamponade should be performed urgently to reattach the detached retina.
C. Observation alone is sufficient as most tears do not progress to retinal detachment.
D. Cryotherapy should be performed around the tear to induce chorioretinal adhesion and prevent further separation.
E. Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents can help reduce subretinal fluid accumulation and improve visual outcomes.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Horseshoe tears are typically located at or near the ora serrata (the junction between ciliary body and retina), which makes them difficult to treat with laser photocoagulation alone as it requires adequate visualization and access to that area using indirect ophthalmoscopy lenses or scleral depression techniques. Cryotherapy is a more effective method for treating these types of tears as it induces chorioretinal adhesion by creating an inflammatory reaction that leads to scar formation. Vitrectomy with gas tamponade may be necessary if there is already retinal detachment or if the tear is large and not amenable to cryotherapy, but it's not urgent unless there are signs of progression such as increased subretinal fluid or new symptoms. Observation alone is not recommended as up to 50% of untreated horseshoe tears can progress to retinal detachment within 6 months. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents has no role in the management of retinal tears or detachments.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents with sudden onset visual loss in his left eye associated with flashes of lights and floaters after being hit on the head during a football match.
On examination, his vision is hand movements only in the left eye and 6/9 in the right eye. Fundoscopy reveals a macula-off retinal detachment involving the temporal retina.

Which one of the following statements regarding this patient's condition is true? 

A. The prognosis for visual recovery depends on the duration and extent of macular involvement.
B. Surgical intervention should be delayed until at least 2 weeks after injury to allow for spontaneous resolution.
C. Pneumatic retinopexy is contraindicated due to high risk of recurrent detachment.
D. Scleral buckling without vitrectomy is preferred over pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for uncomplicated cases.
E. Laser photocoagulation around the break can help prevent recurrence but does not improve visual outcomes.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Traumatic retinal detachments typically occur due to blunt force trauma causing either direct damage to the retina or indirect tractional forces from vitreous movement or hemorrhage. Macula-off detachments have a worse prognosis for visual recovery compared to macula-on detachments as the former involves detachment of the central part of the retina responsible for fine vision. The duration and extent of macular involvement are important factors in determining visual outcomes, with earlier intervention associated with better results. Surgical intervention is usually required for traumatic retinal detachments unless there is spontaneous resolution within 1-2 weeks after injury. Pneumatic retinopexy may be an option for certain cases but it's not preferred due to higher risk of failure or recurrent detachment. PPV is the standard surgical technique used for complicated or large retinal detachments, while scleral buckling alone may be sufficient for uncomplicated cases involving peripheral retina tears. Laser photocoagulation can help prevent recurrence by creating chorioretinal adhesion around the break but does not improve visual outcomes once detachment has occurred.

Question
A 55-year-old woman presents to the rheumatology clinic with a history of rheumatoid arthritis for over 10 years. She has been on multiple medications, including methotrexate and sulfasalazine, but her symptoms have not improved. Her physical examination reveals synovitis in both hands and feet, as well as nodules on her elbows.

Further investigations reveal elevated levels of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid factor (RF). X-rays show erosions in her wrists and metacarpophalangeal joints.

What is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition?

A. Initiate treatment with hydroxychloroquine
B. Start a trial of tocilizumab
C. Perform an MRI scan of the affected joints
D. Consider referral for joint replacement surgery
E. Increase the dose of methotrexate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient has severe, longstanding rheumatoid arthritis that is refractory to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The presence of anti-CCP antibodies and RF indicates a higher likelihood of more aggressive disease progression. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, is indicated for patients who have failed other DMARDs.

Question
A 40-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of fatigue, weight loss, and joint pain in his hands and knees that has persisted for several months. On further questioning, he reports morning stiffness lasting longer than one hour each day.

Physical examination reveals tender swelling in his proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally as well as bony enlargement at the distal interphalangeal joints.

Laboratory tests show elevated inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Rheumatoid factor (RF) is negative, but anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies are positive.

What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?

A. Osteoarthritis
B. Psoriatic arthritis
C. Reactive arthritis
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus
E. Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis, including joint pain, morning stiffness lasting longer than one hour, and swelling in his proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally. However, RF is negative, which occurs in approximately 30% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of anti-CCP antibodies increases the likelihood of a seropositive diagnosis.

Question
A 60-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presents to her primary care physician with complaints of shortness of breath and coughing up blood for several days. She has been taking methotrexate for over five years to manage her condition.

Physical examination reveals tachypnea and decreased breath sounds on the right side.

Chest x-ray shows evidence of pleural effusion on the right side.

Which of the following medications should be considered as a possible cause of this patient's presentation?

A. Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis
B. Sulfasalazine-induced hepatitis
C. Hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy
D. Tocilizumab-induced neutropenia
E. Adalimumab-induced demyelinating disease

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Methotrexate can cause pulmonary toxicity such as pneumonitis or fibrosis, especially in patients who have been taking it long-term or at high doses. Symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Chest x-ray may show evidence of pleural effusion or interstitial infiltrates. Treatment involves discontinuing methotrexate and initiating corticosteroids.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents with a history of recurrent episodes of rhinosinusitis for the past six months. He has been treated with multiple courses of antibiotics, but his symptoms have not improved. On examination, there is tenderness over the maxillary sinuses and nasal polyps are seen on anterior rhinoscopy.

What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Refer for functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)
B. Prescribe oral corticosteroids
C. Perform a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses
D. Order an immunoglobulin E (IgE) level test 
E. Start intravenous antibiotics

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In patients with recurrent or chronic rhinosinusitis that does not respond to initial medical therapy, imaging studies such as CT scans can help identify underlying anatomical abnormalities or complications such as mucosal thickening, obstruction, or abscess formation.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents with complaints of facial pain and pressure over her cheeks and forehead for the past two weeks. She also reports purulent nasal discharge and postnasal drip. On examination, there is tenderness over both maxillary sinuses.

Which of the following is the most likely causative organism? 

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
B. Haemophilus influenzae
C. Moraxella catarrhalis
D. Staphylococcus aureus
E. Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Haemophilus influenzae is one of the most common bacterial pathogens associated with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, particularly in adults who have received prior antibiotic treatment.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents with complaints of persistent unilateral nasal congestion for several months despite using over-the-counter decongestants and saline irrigations. He also reports occasional episodes of epistaxis from the same nostril. On examination, there is a mass in the nasal cavity that appears to be originating from the lateral wall.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Nasal polyp
B. Inverted papilloma
C. Angiofibroma
D. Adenocarcinoma 
E. Squamous cell carcinoma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Inverted papillomas are benign tumors that arise from the mucosal lining of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses and can present with symptoms such as unilateral nasal obstruction, recurrent sinusitis, and epistaxis. They have a tendency for local recurrence and malignant transformation, so surgical resection is often recommended even if they appear histologically benign on biopsy.

Question
A 65-year-old male presents with exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest discomfort. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. On examination, he has elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, bilateral lower limb edema, and a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border. An echocardiogram shows severe tricuspid regurgitation with right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Right heart catheterization reveals elevated pulmonary artery pressures and low cardiac output.

What is the most likely etiology of his tricuspid regurgitation? 

A. Rheumatic heart disease
B. Infective endocarditis
C. Carcinoid syndrome
D. Ebstein anomaly 
E. Idiopathic

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with carcinoid syndrome which can cause fibrosis of the tricuspid valve leading to regurgitation due to serotonin secretion by neuroendocrine tumors in the gut or lung.

Question
A 50-year-old female presents with progressive shortness of breath on exertion over several months associated with cough productive of white sputum but no fever or weight loss. She has a past medical history significant for mitral valve prolapse diagnosed during her teenage years but was never treated for it as she remained asymptomatic until now.
On examination, she has bilateral basal crepitations and a mid-systolic click heard loudest at the apex.

B. MRI spine
C. CT scan abdomen and pelvis
D. Bone scan
E. PET-CT scan

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In patients with known or suspected malignancy presenting with new onset back pain, bone scan is the investigation of choice to detect metastatic disease involving the spine.

Question
A 30-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of lower back pain that started suddenly while lifting weights at the gym three days ago. He has no history of trauma or previous back pain. Examination reveals tenderness over the lower lumbar spine with no neurological deficits.

Which of the following is true regarding this patient's injury? 

A. The most common cause of spinal fractures in young adults is osteoporosis.
B. CT scan should be performed immediately to rule out a fracture.
C. MRI should be performed immediately to assess for disc herniation.
D. Conservative management including rest and analgesia is sufficient for most cases of acute low back pain.
E. Surgery is indicated if there is evidence of nerve root compression.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with new onset back pain without a clear history of trauma, imaging should be performed to rule out underlying pathology such as vertebral fractures or disc herniation. CT scan is more sensitive than X-ray in detecting fractures and should be considered if there is clinical suspicion of a fracture.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with a non-healing ulcer on his lower lip that has been present for several months. He is a heavy smoker and drinks alcohol regularly. Biopsy of the lesion reveals squamous cell carcinoma. Further imaging studies show no evidence of metastasis.

Which one of the following factors is most strongly associated with an increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma in this patient? 

A. Age
B. Smoking history 
C. Alcohol consumption 
D. Family history of skin cancer 
E. Exposure to ionizing radiation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Squamous cell carcinoma is strongly associated with tobacco use, particularly smoking cigarettes or cigars, which increases the risk by up to six times compared to non-smokers.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with a painful lump in her left breast that has been growing rapidly over the past few weeks. On examination, there is a large mass measuring approximately 8 cm in diameter, with areas of necrosis and ulceration on the surface.

Fine needle aspiration cytology shows malignant cells consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

Which one of the following statements regarding this presentation is true? 

A. Breast cancer rarely presents as squamous cell carcinoma.
B. Squamous cell carcinoma arising from the breast typically occurs in younger women.
C. The prognosis for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is generally better than those with other types of breast cancer.
D. Treatment options for squamous cell carcinoma of the breast are similar to those for other types of invasive breast cancer.
E. Squamous cell carcinoma arising from the breast is usually associated with underlying ductal or lobular carcinomas.

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of all breast cancers and typically occurs in older women (>60 years). Due to its rarity, there are no established guidelines for treatment but it is typically treated with surgery and radiation therapy, similar to other types of invasive breast cancer.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents with a non-healing ulcer on his scalp that has been present for several months. He reports a history of sun exposure and has multiple actinic keratoses on his face and neck.

Biopsy of the lesion reveals squamous cell carcinoma with perineural invasion.

Which one of the following statements regarding this presentation is true? 

A. Perineural invasion is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis.
B. Squamous cell carcinoma arising from actinic keratoses is less aggressive than those arising de novo.
C. The prognosis for patients with squamous cell carcinoma involving the scalp is generally better than those involving other anatomical sites.
D. Mohs micrographic surgery is not recommended for treating squamous cell carcinoma involving the scalp due to its complex anatomy.
E. Radiation therapy is contraindicated in patients with perineural invasion due to an increased risk of nerve damage.

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Perineural invasion occurs when malignant cells invade nerves surrounding the tumor, which can increase the risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis. Squamous cell carcinoma arising from actinic keratoses may be more aggressive than those arising de novo due to underlying genetic changes caused by chronic UV exposure. Treatment options for squamous cell carcinoma involving the scalp depend on various factors including size, depth, location, and involvement of critical structures but may include Mohs micrographic surgery or radiation therapy in select cases.

Question
A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. His wife reports that he was fine just a few hours ago, but now he cannot move his left arm or leg and is slurring his words. On examination, you find him to have a dense left hemiparesis and expressive aphasia. His blood pressure is elevated at 180/100 mmHg, but otherwise his vital signs are stable. You suspect an ischemic stroke and order a CT scan of the brain which shows no evidence of hemorrhage.
What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
B. Transfer patient for endovascular thrombectomy
C. Initiate antihypertensive therapy
D. Order carotid doppler ultrasound 
E. Perform MRI brain with diffusion weighted imaging

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's presentation suggests an acute ischemic stroke, likely involving the middle cerebral artery territory given the presence of both motor and speech deficits on the left side. Given that it has been only a few hours since symptom onset, tPA may be considered if there are no contraindications; however, in this case, the patient's elevated blood pressure would need to be controlled first before considering tPA administration as per guidelines. Endovascular thrombectomy may also be considered depending on eligibility criteria, but again controlling hypertension should take priority initially.

Question
A 54-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of recurrent episodes of transient right-sided weakness lasting several minutes over the past week without any other symptoms such as speech difficulties or visual changes. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but is otherwise healthy and takes medications regularly for these conditions.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Transient ischemic attack
B. Migraine with aura 
C. Hypoglycemia 
D. Seizure disorder 
E. Multiple sclerosis 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), which are brief episodes of neurological dysfunction caused by temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain. TIAs can be a warning sign for an impending stroke and require urgent evaluation and management to prevent further cerebrovascular events.

Question
An 80-year-old man is admitted to the hospital after being found unresponsive at home by his daughter. On arrival, he is noted to have right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking, but no other significant findings on examination or imaging studies.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation? 

A. Ischemic stroke
B. Hemorrhagic stroke
C. Subdural hematoma
D. Metabolic encephalopathy 
E. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Given the sudden onset of symptoms in an elderly patient with focal neurological deficits, a cerebrovascular event such as a stroke or hemorrhage should be suspected initially. In this case, given that there were no signs of infarction on imaging studies, a hemorrhagic stroke would be the most likely diagnosis based on clinical presentation alone until proven otherwise through additional diagnostic testing such as CT angiography or MRI with gradient echo sequences to detect small bleeds not seen on standard CT scans.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden-onset severe headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia. On examination, he has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14/15 and a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg. The CT scan is negative for any abnormalities, but the lumbar puncture shows xanthochromia and elevated red blood cells count. Further investigation reveals that the patient has an unruptured cerebral aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery. Which of the following treatment options would be most appropriate for this patient? 

A. Endovascular coiling
B. Surgical clipping
C. Nimodipine therapy only
D. Extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery 
E. Observation

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with an unruptured cerebral aneurysm causing subarachnoid hemorrhage, surgical clipping is considered as the gold standard treatment option due to its long-term durability compared to endovascular coiling or observation alone.

Question
A 65-year-old woman presents to the hospital with a history of recurrent headaches over several months which have worsened recently along with nausea and vomiting episodes. She also reports experiencing transient visual disturbances such as blurred vision and double vision occasionally over the past few weeks. MRI imaging reveals multiple intracranial lesions suggestive of metastatic disease; however, further evaluation demonstrates that these are actually small berry aneurysms located in different regions of her brain including posterior communicating artery and middle cerebral artery bifurcation.
Which one of the following management strategies should be considered? 

A. Conservative management only
B. Endovascular coiling 
C. Stereotactic radiosurgery 
D. Microsurgical clipping 
E. Combination therapy involving both microsurgical clipping and stereotactic radiosurgery

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In patients with multiple berry aneurysms, microsurgical clipping is preferred over endovascular coiling or stereotactic radiosurgery due to the higher risk of recurrence and rebleeding associated with these other treatment options.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden-onset severe headache, vomiting, and photophobia. On examination, he has a GCS score of 15/15 and a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg. The CT scan shows no abnormalities; however, the lumbar puncture reveals xanthochromia and elevated red blood cells count.
Which one of the following diagnostic tests should be considered? 

A. Cerebral angiography 
B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
C. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound
D. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) 
E. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA)

Which type of subdural haemorrhage is most likely present in this patient? 

A. Acute subdural haemorrhage
B. Subacute subdural haemorrhage
C. Chronic subdural haemorrhage
D. Mixed-density subdural haemorrhage 
E. Traumatic intracerebral haematoma

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests that the patient has developed symptoms gradually, indicating that the bleed occurred over several days or weeks ago, making it more likely to be a subacute subdural haemorrhage.

Question
A 50-year-old woman presents to the emergency department following an assault where she was hit on her head with a blunt object. She is alert but confused and disoriented with no focal neurological deficits noted on examination except for mild left-sided weakness.
What diagnostic test should be performed first? 

A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
B. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram
C. Lumbar puncture
D. Electroencephalogram (EEG)
E. Non-contrast CT scan

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In patients presenting with acute head injury, non-contrast CT scan is usually the initial diagnostic test as it can quickly identify any significant intracranial pathology such as an acute subdural hematoma.

Question
A 70-year-old male presents to the hospital with complaints of progressive headaches and difficulty walking for two weeks. He has a history of hypertension and falls frequently. CT scan shows bilateral subdural haemorrhage with midline shift.

His liver function tests are elevated, and an ultrasound scan shows evidence of cirrhosis.

Which medication would be most appropriate for this patient's management? 

A. Acamprosate
B. Naltrexone
C. Disulfiram
D. Topiramate
E. Baclofen

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Baclofen is a GABA-B receptor agonist that has been shown to reduce cravings and improve abstinence rates in patients with alcohol dependence, particularly those with severe disease or hepatic impairment.

Question
A 26-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of anxiety and depression following the breakdown of her relationship with her partner who was also her primary source of financial support. She admits to using cocaine recreationally at weekends but denies any other drug use or history of mental illness.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Adjustment disorder
B. Major depressive disorder 
C. Generalized anxiety disorder 
D. Panic disorder 
E. Substance-induced mood disorder

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a substance-induced mood disorder, which can occur as a result of acute intoxication or withdrawal from drugs such as cocaine.

Question
A 38-year-old man is admitted to hospital following an overdose on heroin that he obtained from a local dealer while trying to manage his chronic back pain without prescription medication due to financial constraints.

Which medication would be most appropriate for managing this patient's opioid withdrawal? 

A. Methadone
B. Buprenorphine 
C. Naltrexone 
D. Clonidine 
E. Diazepam

Explanation: Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that can be used to manage withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings in patients with opioid dependence, including those who have recently overdosed on heroin. It has a lower risk of respiratory depression than methadone and can be prescribed by GPs as part of a community-based treatment program.

Question
A 65-year-old man with a history of diabetes and hypertension undergoes an open cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. On postoperative day 3, he develops fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Examination reveals erythema and tenderness around the surgical incision site. Blood cultures are negative. What is the most likely cause of his symptoms? Describe the pathophysiology of surgical site infections in this patient population.

A. Infection with Escherichia coli
B. Infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae
C. Infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa
D. Infection with Enterococcus faecalis
E. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a common complication after surgery, particularly in patients who have comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension that impair wound healing and increase susceptibility to infection. The pathophysiology of SSIs involves contamination of the surgical site by microorganisms during or after surgery, leading to colonization and subsequent infection if host defenses are overwhelmed or compromised. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common pathogens responsible for SSIs, particularly in patients undergoing abdominal surgery where it can colonize the skin and mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract and ascend into the biliary tree.

Question
A 50-year-old woman undergoes a mastectomy for breast cancer followed by immediate reconstruction using tissue expanders placed beneath her pectoral muscles. Two weeks later she presents with fever, chills, malaise, and pain at the surgical site associated with purulent drainage from her drain sites on both sides of her chest wall which were removed three days ago? What is your diagnosis? 

A. Seroma formation 
B. Hematoma formation 
C. Wound dehiscence 
D. Surgical site infection
E. Lymphedema

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a surgical site infection (SSI), which is defined as an infection that occurs within 30 days after surgery or within one year if an implant is left in place. SSIs can be classified as superficial, deep incisional, and organ/space infections based on the depth of involvement. Risk factors for SSIs include diabetes, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, prolonged operative time, and contaminated or dirty wounds.

Question
A 70-year-old man undergoes a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. On postoperative day 1 he develops fever and leukocytosis? What is the most appropriate management? Describe the role of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing surgical site infections? 

A. Observation only
B. Repeat imaging studies
C. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics
D. Return to theatre for exploration 
E. Start antipyretics

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are concerning for a possible surgical site infection (SSI) following his laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Prophylactic antibiotics play an important role in reducing the risk of SSIs by decreasing bacterial colonization at the surgical site and preventing subsequent infection. Antibiotic selection should be based on local resistance patterns and tailored to individual patients' risk factors and comorbidities to optimize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects such as allergic reactions and antibiotic-associated diarrhea or colitis caused by Clostridioides difficile overgrowth.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents to his GP complaining of a painless lump on his left testicle that he has noticed for several months. He denies any other symptoms or significant past medical history but admits to smoking half a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 10 years. On examination, there is a firm nodule on his left testicle which does not trans-illuminate. An ultrasound confirms the presence of a solid mass suspicious for malignancy, and further imaging reveals multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with metastasis.

Which of the following treatment options would be considered first-line therapy for this patient?

A. Chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP)
B. Radiotherapy to the affected testis
C. Radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by surveillance
D. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant
E. Palliative care only

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: BEP chemotherapy is considered first-line therapy for advanced-stage germ cell tumors such as this patient's presentation involving both testicular and pulmonary involvement.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with acute onset of severe pain in his right testicle that started about an hour ago. He reports no history of trauma, but he did have a similar episode two years ago that resolved spontaneously. On examination, his right testis is swollen and tender to palpation, while the left one appears normal. There is no redness or discharge from the urethra, and abdominal examination is unremarkable. The patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications.
What is the most appropriate management?

A. Immediate involvement of the on-call urologist to arrange exploration of the scrotum to exclude torsion
B. Treat with ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscular (im) plus doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10–14 days
C. Perform Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum followed by surgical intervention if necessary
D. Admit to hospital for intravenous (iv) teicoplanin for 3 days
E. Offer pain relief only

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment within six hours to prevent permanent damage to the affected testicle. In this case, given the sudden onset of severe pain in a previously healthy young man without any obvious cause, testicular torsion should be suspected as the primary diagnosis until proven otherwise. Doppler ultrasound can confirm or rule out torsion by assessing blood flow to the affected testis; if there is absent or reduced blood flow, immediate surgical intervention is required.

Question
A 16-year-old boy presents with a three-day history of intermittent dull ache in his left testicle that became progressively worse over time and was associated with nausea and vomiting but no fever or dysuria. On examination, his left testis is enlarged and tender, and the cremasteric reflex is absent. The right testis appears normal. There is no redness or swelling of the scrotum, and abdominal examination is unremarkable. Urinalysis shows pyuria.
What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Testicular torsion
B. Epididymitis
C. Orchitis
D. Varicocele
E. Hydrocele

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Epididymitis is an inflammation of the epididymis that can be caused by bacterial infection (most commonly Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae) or non-infectious causes such as trauma or autoimmune disease. It typically presents with gradual onset of unilateral pain and tenderness in the scrotum, often accompanied by fever, dysuria, and urinary frequency/urgency due to involvement of adjacent structures like the prostate gland and urethra. Absence of the cremasteric reflex on physical examination suggests epididymitis rather than torsion.

Question
A 30-year-old man presents with a two-day history of sudden onset severe pain in his left testicle that started while he was playing football but resolved spontaneously after about 20 minutes only to recur again later that day when he had sex with his girlfriend.

B. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL)
C. Ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy
D. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) 
E. Open surgery

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Non-obstructing stones less than 5mm in size can be managed conservatively with observation, hydration and analgesia.

Question
A 65-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of renal colic over the past year. He has a history of gout and is currently on allopurinol for management of hyperuricemia. On examination, there is tenderness in his right flank region. An ultrasound scan shows a 1cm stone in the lower pole of the right kidney with mild hydronephrosis.
What is the most likely composition of the renal stone? 

A. Calcium phosphate
B. Xanthine
C. Urate
D. Calcium oxalate monohydrate 
E. Struvite

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Patients with gout are at increased risk of developing uric acid stones due to elevated levels of uric acid in their urine leading to supersaturation and precipitation of uric acid crystals which form into stones over time.

Question
A 65-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) over the past year. He has been treated with antibiotics multiple times but continues to have symptoms. On further evaluation, he is found to have an enlarged prostate and bladder stones. What is the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Long-term prophylactic antibiotics 
B. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
C. Bladder irrigation
D. Lithotripsy
E. Ureteroscopy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's recurrent UTIs may be due to underlying structural abnormalities such as an enlarged prostate or bladder stones, which can cause incomplete emptying of urine from the bladder leading to bacterial growth and infection. TURP is a surgical procedure that removes part of the prostate gland, which can improve urinary flow and reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs.

Question
A 30-year-old female patient presents with a history of frequent UTIs despite taking prophylactic antibiotics for several months. She reports dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain associated with each episode of UTI. Urine cultures show Escherichia coli bacteria resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin. What is the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Switching to another antibiotic based on culture sensitivity results
B. Referral to urology for cystoscopy
C. Starting intravenous antibiotics 
D. Prescribing cranberry supplements 
E. Performing a renal ultrasound

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Recurrent UTIs despite prophylaxis may indicate underlying anatomical or functional abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux or urethral stricture that require further investigation by a urologist. Cystoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows visualization of the bladder and urethra to identify any structural abnormalities.

Question
A 50-year-old male patient presents with fever, chills, flank pain, and dysuria for the past two days. On examination, he has costovertebral angle tenderness on the right side. Urine analysis shows pyuria and bacteriuria. What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Empiric antibiotic therapy 
B. Renal ultrasound
C. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
D. Urology referral for cystoscopy
E. Intravenous fluids

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of acute pyelonephritis, which is a serious infection requiring prompt treatment with empiric antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin until culture sensitivity results become available. Imaging studies may be needed if there is suspicion of complications such as abscess formation or obstruction but are not required in all cases.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe urticaria, angioedema and shortness of breath.

D. Pars planitis 
E. Acute retinal necrosis 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with posterior uveitis, which involves inflammation in the posterior segment of the eye (vitreous humor or retina). It can be caused by various infectious or non-infectious etiologies such as toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus infection, sarcoidosis, or Behçet's disease.

Question
A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a vesicular rash on his face and neck that has been present for the past week. He reports feeling generally unwell, with fever and malaise. On examination, there are multiple crusted lesions on his face and neck, as well as some new vesicles. Blood tests reveal positive varicella zoster virus IgM antibodies.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Herpes simplex virus infection 
B. Varicella zoster virus reactivation 
C. Measles infection 
D. Rubella infection 
E. Mumps infection

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The presentation of a vesicular rash in an adult with systemic symptoms suggests reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), also known as shingles or herpes zoster.

Question
A 28-year-old woman who is 30 weeks pregnant presents to her obstetrician after being exposed to chickenpox at work by one of her colleagues who developed a rash two days ago. She reports having had chickenpox when she was five years old but does not remember if she received any treatment at that time.

What is the most appropriate management? 

A. Oral aciclovir

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents with bilateral varicose veins that have been present for several years but have recently become more symptomatic with itching and discomfort in her lower limbs. She reports no previous episodes of superficial thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but has a medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidaemia treated with medication. On examination, she has tortuous dilated veins on both legs without any evidence of skin changes or ulcers.
What is the most appropriate management option? 

A. Conservative measures such as compression stockings
B. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)
C. Sclerotherapy
D. Surgical ligation and stripping
E. Watchful waiting

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In patients with uncomplicated varicose veins, conservative measures such as compression stockings should be the first-line treatment. EVLA and sclerotherapy are minimally invasive options for patients with symptomatic varicose veins who have failed conservative management. Surgical ligation and stripping may be considered in patients with severe symptoms or complications such as skin changes or ulcers.

Question
A 70-year-old man presents to his GP with a history of recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis in his right leg over the past year. He has no significant medical history except for hypertension treated with medication. On examination, there is erythema and tenderness along the course of the great saphenous vein on his right leg without any evidence of DVT or skin changes.
What is the most appropriate management option? 

A. Conservative measures such as compression stockings
B. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)
C. Sclerotherapy
D. Anticoagulation therapy
E. Surgical ligation and stripping

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In patients with recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis, endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) or surgical ligation and stripping may be considered to prevent further episodes and potential progression to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Conservative measures such as compression stockings may also be used to alleviate symptoms but do not address the underlying pathology. Anticoagulation therapy is not indicated in isolated cases of superficial thrombophlebitis unless there is evidence of extension into deeper veins or concomitant DVT.

Question
A 28-year-old primigravida at 36 weeks gestation presents to the antenatal clinic with a history of vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. Ultrasound reveals a low-lying placenta, and further evaluation shows that there is a velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord into the membranes. The obstetrician suspects vasa praevia and schedules an urgent Caesarean section for delivery.
Which of the following statements regarding vasa praevia is correct? 

A. Vasa praevia occurs when fetal vessels cross over the internal os of the cervix
B. It is more common in women who have had multiple pregnancies
C. Fetal bradycardia is a common feature during labour in cases of vasa praevia
D. Diagnosis can be confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound examination 
E. Management involves elective Caesarean section before labour

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Vasa praevia occurs when fetal blood vessels within the membranes are unsupported by placental tissue or traverse across the internal cervical os, increasing their risk of rupture during labour leading to fetal exsanguination and death. It is more commonly seen in women with low-lying placentas, multiple pregnancies, IVF conception, or those with velamentous cord insertion. Fetal distress may occur due to rapid loss of blood from ruptured vessels resulting in hypoxemia and bradycardia on CTG monitoring. Transvaginal ultrasound has high sensitivity but low specificity for diagnosis; however, MRI remains gold standard imaging modality for definitive diagnosis.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents at 34 weeks gestation with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and suspected vasa praevia based on prenatal ultrasound findings showing marginal cord insertion and crossing over the cervical os.
What would be your next step in the management of this patient? 

A. Immediate induction of labour
B. Expectant management with close fetal monitoring 
C. Administration of corticosteroids to enhance fetal lung maturity
D. Emergency Caesarean section under general anaesthesia 
E. Intrauterine transfusion

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: PPROM is a known risk factor for vasa praevia, and when suspected, immediate delivery by emergency Caesarean section under general anaesthesia is recommended due to the high risk of fetal exsanguination during vaginal delivery or attempted induction of labour. Fetal distress may occur rapidly after rupture of membranes leading to hypoxemia and bradycardia on CTG monitoring, necessitating urgent intervention.

Question
A 29-year-old woman presents at 28 weeks gestation with painless vaginal bleeding and ultrasound findings suggestive of placenta previa and vasa praevia.
Which of the following statements regarding the diagnosis and management of vasa praevia is correct? 

A. The definitive diagnosis can be made by clinical examination alone
B. Vaginal delivery is possible if there are no signs of fetal distress 
C. Antenatal steroid administration should be avoided due to increased risk of bleeding
D. Elective Caesarean section before onset of labour is recommended in all cases 
E. Blood transfusion should not be considered as it increases the risk of maternal morbidity

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Diagnosis requires prenatal imaging such as transvaginal ultrasound or MRI, which have high sensitivity but low specificity; therefore, any suspicion warrants further evaluation by an expert obstetrician or referral to a tertiary centre with expertise in managing high-risk pregnancies. Elective Caesarean section before onset of labour remains the gold standard for preventing catastrophic neonatal outcomes associated with vasa praevia, regardless of whether there are signs of fetal distress or not. Antenatal corticosteroids should be administered to enhance fetal lung maturity, and blood transfusion may be required in cases of severe maternal haemorrhage.

Question
A 35-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with a history of recurrent episodes of syncope over the past few months. She reports feeling lightheaded and nauseated before each episode, which is followed by loss of consciousness for a few seconds. She has no significant medical history and takes no medications. On examination, her blood pressure is normal, and there are no cardiac murmurs or arrhythmias detected on auscultation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus bradycardia with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). A tilt-table test is performed, which reproduces her symptoms after 10 minutes in an upright position.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
B. Neurocardiogenic syncope
C. Long QT syndrome
D. Brugada syndrome
E. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity

Correct Answer: B

This condition typically occurs due to a reflex response that leads to decreased heart rate and blood pressure resulting in fainting spells triggered by various stimuli such as emotional stress or prolonged standing.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of recurrent episodes of dizziness and near-syncope while performing routine activities such as gardening or walking up stairs at home over the past few weeks. He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath but reports feeling lightheaded before each episode, which resolves spontaneously within a few seconds without loss of consciousness. His medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia for which he takes multiple medications.
Which one of the following conditions should be considered in this patient? 

A. Vasovagal syncope 
B. Orthostatic hypotension 
C. Atrial fibrillation 
D. Pulmonary embolism 
E. Hypoglycemia 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of orthostatic hypotension, which is a common cause of dizziness and near-syncope in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. This condition occurs due to an inadequate compensatory response to changes in posture resulting in decreased blood pressure upon standing.

Question
A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of recurrent episodes of syncope that occur during her menstrual cycle over the past few months.

Explanation: The clinical picture described in this question is suggestive of Ross River virus infection, which is a mosquito-borne viral illness that presents with fever, rash, and joint pain affecting the hands and feet. The characteristic feature of this disease is the presence of vesicles on palms and soles.

Question
A 28-year-old female presents to her GP with a widespread rash involving her face, trunk, and extremities. She reports feeling unwell for the past week with malaise, headache, and myalgia. On examination, she has multiple erythematous macules and papules coalescing into plaques on her face, chest, back, arms, and legs. Some of these lesions have developed central clearing while others are confluent.

Which of the following viruses is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation? 

A. Measles virus
B. Varicella-zoster virus
C. Human herpesvirus-8
D. Adenovirus 
E. Enterovirus

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical features described in this question are consistent with a diagnosis of measles infection which typically presents as a prodrome of fever, cough, coryza followed by a maculopapular rash starting from behind the ears before spreading to involve the face and trunk within days of onset.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. He reports that his symptoms started after eating raw oysters at a seafood restaurant two days ago. On examination, he is found to have a fever of 38.5°C and signs of dehydration. His blood tests show elevated liver enzymes and leukocytosis. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Norovirus infection 
B. Rotavirus infection 
C. Adenovirus infection 
D. Hepatitis A virus infection
E. Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's history of consuming raw oysters suggests a possible bacterial cause for his gastroenteritis symptoms, which are also consistent with Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection. This bacterium is commonly associated with contaminated shellfish and can cause severe gastrointestinal illness with symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and chills.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to her GP complaining of persistent diarrhoea for the past week accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She has no significant medical history but reports having recently travelled to Southeast Asia where she consumed street food from local vendors on several occasions during her trip. On examination, she appears dehydrated with dry mucous membranes and tachycardia but otherwise stable vital signs. Stool samples reveal the presence of rotavirus antigen in her faeces.
What is the most appropriate management strategy? 

A. Prescribe antibiotics targeting common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis
B. Administer oral rehydration therapy (ORT) alone
C. Perform stool culture testing to identify potential bacterial pathogens 
D. Recommend hospital admission for intravenous fluid replacement therapy
E. Advise symptomatic treatment only without any further intervention

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Rotavirus is a common viral cause of gastroenteritis, especially in young children and travellers to endemic areas. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses and stool culture testing is unlikely to yield any useful information in this case. Hospital admission may be necessary for severe cases requiring intravenous fluids but the patient's stable vital signs suggest that oral rehydration therapy (ORT) alone would be sufficient.

Question
A 42-year-old man presents with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting after consuming contaminated food at a family gathering. He reports that several other guests who ate the same food have also developed similar symptoms. On examination, he appears dehydrated with sunken eyes and dry mucous membranes.
What is the most likely causative organism? 

A. Staphylococcus aureus 
B. Clostridium difficile 
C. Escherichia coli O157:H7
D. Shigella sonnei
E. Bacillus cereus

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The rapid onset of symptoms following ingestion of contaminated food suggests a possible bacterial toxin-mediated illness rather than an infection caused by live bacteria or viruses. Staphylococcus aureus is commonly associated with such outbreaks due to its ability to produce heat-stable enterotoxins that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms within hours of ingestion of contaminated food.

Question
A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and confusion. He has a history of chronic hepatitis B infection and is currently on antiviral therapy. On examination, he appears jaundiced and his abdomen is distended and tender to palpation. Blood tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy. An ultrasound scan shows evidence of ascites, splenomegaly and dilated intrahepatic bile ducts.
Which of the following complications of chronic hepatitis B infection is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation? 
A. Hepatocellular carcinoma
B. Cirrhosis
C. Acute liver failure
D. Ascending cholangitis
E. Budd-Chiari syndrome

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The clinical features described in this question are consistent with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), which occurs due to obstruction of hepatic venous outflow from the liver parenchyma or inferior vena cava (IVC). This can result in portal hypertension, hepatomegaly, ascites, splenomegaly and dilated intrahepatic bile ducts as seen on imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scans. Chronic viral hepatitis infections such as hepatitis B can lead to BCS through various mechanisms including thrombosis formation within the hepatic veins or IVC.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of fatigue, anorexia and right upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to her back. She has no significant past medical history but admits to occasional alcohol use at social events over the past few years. Physical examination reveals mild jaundice, tenderness over the right hypochondrium region and hepatosplenomegaly.
Blood tests show elevated levels of bilirubin, transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. Serological tests for hepatitis A, B and C are negative. An abdominal ultrasound scan shows a diffusely enlarged liver with increased echogenicity.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 
A. Autoimmune hepatitis
B. Alcoholic hepatitis
C. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
D. Wilson's disease
E. Acute viral hepatitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The clinical features described in this question suggest alcoholic hepatitis, which is an acute inflammatory condition of the liver that can occur due to excessive alcohol consumption over a prolonged period of time. Patients typically present with jaundice, hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, fever and elevated levels of serum transaminases and bilirubin. Imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scans may show evidence of hepatic steatosis or cirrhosis depending on the severity and duration of alcohol abuse.

Question
A 40-year-old man presents with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting over the past few months. He has a history of chronic hepatitis C infection but has not received any antiviral therapy yet. On examination, he appears pale and dehydrated with mild epigastric tenderness but no hepatosplenomegaly or ascites.
Blood tests reveal elevated levels of amylase and lipase enzymes along with deranged liver function parameters including raised bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels.
An abdominal CT scan shows diffuse pancreatic enlargement with multiple hypodense lesions throughout the glandular parenchyma.
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 
A. Chronic pancreatitis
B. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
C. Hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis to pancreas
D. Autoimmune pancreatitis
E. Acute viral hepatitis

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical features and imaging findings described in this question suggest autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), which is a rare form of chronic pancreatitis that can be associated with various autoimmune disorders including primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory bowel disease or systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients typically present with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting along with elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes such as amylase and lipase. Imaging studies such as CT scans may show diffuse pancreatic enlargement with multiple hypodense lesions throughout the glandular parenchyma, which are characteristic features of AIP.

Question
A 45-year-old man presents to the ophthalmology clinic with a complaint of visual disturbance in his left eye for the past month. He reports seeing flashing lights and floaters, followed by a sudden loss of vision in the temporal field of his left eye. On examination, there is an inferior altitudinal defect on visual field testing in the left eye. The patient has no significant medical history and takes no regular medications.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's visual field defect? 

A. Optic nerve glioma
B. Retinal detachment
C. Central retinal artery occlusion
D. Ischemic optic neuropathy
E. Macular degeneration

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The clinical presentation described suggests ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) as the most likely diagnosis, which can be caused by various factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or arteriosclerosis.

Question
A 60-year-old woman presents to her GP with complaints of difficulty reading and driving due to poor peripheral vision over the past year. She also reports experiencing headaches and dizziness occasionally but denies any recent head trauma or other neurological symptoms.
On examination, there is bilateral superior arcuate scotoma on visual field testing.
Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this patient's visual field defect? 

A. Glaucoma 
B. Multiple sclerosis 
C. Pituitary adenoma 
D. Migraine aura without headache 
E. Optic neuritis 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presence of bilateral superior arcuate scotomas suggests glaucoma as the most probable diagnosis, which can lead to progressive damage to the optic nerve fibers resulting in characteristic patterns of visual field defects.

Question
A 35-year-old male presents with a complaint of blurred vision and difficulty seeing at night for several months now that has been progressively worsening. He also reports seeing halos around lights and experiencing occasional headaches.
On examination, there is a bilateral concentric constriction of visual fields with sparing of central vision.
Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this patient's visual field defect? 

A. Retinitis pigmentosa 
B. Optic nerve compression 
C. Cataract 
D. Diabetic retinopathy
E. Age-related macular degeneration

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation described suggests retinitis pigmentosa as the most probable diagnosis, which is an inherited disorder that affects the retina leading to progressive loss of peripheral vision and night blindness while preserving central vision until late stages.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents with a history of chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. He has been experiencing fatigue, weakness, and muscle pain for the past few months. On examination, he has bilateral lower limb tenderness and proximal muscle weakness. His blood tests reveal low levels of vitamin D, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Osteoporosis
B. Rickets
C. Hypoparathyroidism
D. Hyperparathyroidism
E. Chronic kidney disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with rickets due to severe vitamin D deficiency caused by chronic alcoholism and malnutrition.

Question
A 32-year-old woman presents with a history of recurrent miscarriages in the first trimester of pregnancy over the past year despite adequate antenatal care. She reports no significant medical or surgical history but mentions that she follows a strict vegan diet without any supplements or fortified foods.

Which of the following vitamins is most likely deficient in this patient? 

A. Vitamin C
B. Vitamin E
C. Vitamin K
D. Folic acid 
E. Vitamin B12

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: The patient's strict vegan diet puts her at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency which can lead to recurrent miscarriages.

Question
A 50-year-old man presents with a history of progressive difficulty walking over the past year along with numbness and tingling sensations in his hands and feet bilaterally.
On examination, he has decreased vibration sense in both lower limbs along with reduced ankle reflexes.
His blood tests show low levels of vitamin B12.

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A) Oral supplementation with high-dose vitamin B12 
B) Intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 
C) Nerve conduction studies 
D) MRI of the spine 
E) Referral to a neurologist 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency neuropathy, and intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 is the most appropriate next step for treatment.

Question
A 55-year-old male presents to his GP with a history of fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath on exertion for the past few weeks. He has no significant medical or surgical history but is a strict vegetarian and consumes no animal products. On examination, he appears pale, and his conjunctivae are slightly icteric. His laboratory investigations reveal a haemoglobin level of 85 g/L (normal range: 130-180 g/L), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 110 fL (normal range: 80-100 fL), serum vitamin B12 level of <50 pmol/L (normal range: 160-900 pmol/L), and serum folate level within normal limits.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's anaemia? 

A. Pernicious anaemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency
B. Dietary deficiency of vitamin B12 
C. Folate deficiency 
D. Haemolytic anaemia 
E. Chronic kidney disease

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with megaloblastic anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can occur in individuals who follow a strict vegetarian diet devoid of animal products that contain vitamin B12. Pernicious anaemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency may also present similarly; however, it typically affects older adults (>60 years) and requires further testing for anti-intrinsic factor antibodies for confirmation. Folate deficiency can also cause megaloblastic anaemia; however, the patient's serum folate levels were within normal limits.

Question
A 32-year-old female presents to her GP with complaints of numbness and tingling sensations in her hands and feet that have been progressively worsening over the past few months along with difficulty walking long distances without feeling fatigued quickly. She has no significant medical or surgical history but is a strict vegan and takes no vitamin supplements. On examination, she has decreased vibratory sensation in her lower extremities and mild ataxia. Her laboratory investigations reveal a haemoglobin level of 100 g/L (normal range: 120-160 g/L), MCV of 110 fL (normal range: 80-100 fL), serum vitamin B12 level of <50 pmol/L (normal range: 160-900 pmol/L), and normal serum folate levels.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pernicious anaemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency
B. Dietary deficiency of vitamin B12 
C. Folate deficiency 
D. Multiple sclerosis 
E. Diabetic neuropathy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with megaloblastic anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can occur in individuals who follow a strict vegan diet devoid of animal products that contain vitamin B12. However, the presence of neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling sensations, ataxia, and decreased vibratory sensation suggests pernicious anaemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency as the underlying cause. Further testing for anti-intrinsic factor antibodies should be done for confirmation.

Question
A 45-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath on exertion for the past few weeks along with difficulty swallowing solid foods without choking or coughing spells occasionally. He has a history of gastric bypass surgery five years ago for morbid obesity but has lost only minimal weight since then despite following an appropriate diet plan prescribed by his dietician regularly. On examination, he appears pale and slightly jaundiced; there are no palpable lymph nodes or hepatosplenomegaly noted on abdominal examination. His laboratory investigations reveal a haemoglobin level of 85 g/L (normal range: 130-180 g/L), MCV of 110 fL (normal range: 80-100 fL), serum vitamin B12 level of <50 pmol/L (normal range: 160-900 pmol/L), and normal serum folate levels.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's anaemia? 

A. Pernicious anaemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency
B. Dietary deficiency of vitamin B12 
C. Folate deficiency 
D. Iron-deficiency anaemia 
E. Anaemia of chronic disease

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with megaloblastic anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can occur in individuals who have undergone gastric bypass surgery that involves removing a significant portion of the stomach responsible for producing intrinsic factor required for absorption of dietary vitamin B12. However, the presence of difficulty swallowing solid foods without choking or coughing spells occasionally suggests an underlying stricture or narrowing at the gastrojejunal anastomosis site, leading to malabsorption of essential nutrients such as iron and vitamins including B12. Further investigations such as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be done to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate management strategies accordingly.

Question
A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vomiting for the past 24 hours. He has a history of chronic constipation and has been taking laxatives regularly for the past few months. On examination, his abdomen is distended, tympanic on percussion, and tender to palpation in all quadrants. Bowel sounds are absent. An abdominal X-ray shows dilated loops of bowel with multiple air-fluid levels suggestive of small bowel obstruction. CT scan confirms the diagnosis of volvulus with twisting of the sigmoid colon around its mesenteric axis.

Which one of the following is true regarding sigmoid volvulus? 

A. It is more common in women than men
B. The most common site of volvulus is at the hepatic flexure
C. Endoscopic decompression is not recommended as it carries a high risk of perforation 
D. Surgery should be considered if endoscopic reduction fails or there are signs of ischemia
E. Patients typically present with bloody diarrhea

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Sigmoid volvulus occurs when there is torsion or twisting of the sigmoid colon around its mesenteric axis leading to obstruction and ischemia. It is more common in elderly patients with chronic constipation or neurological disorders affecting bowel motility, and in those who have had previous abdominal surgery or radiation therapy. Men are affected more commonly than women. Endoscopic decompression can be attempted but carries a high risk of perforation; therefore, surgery should be considered if endoscopic reduction fails or there are signs of ischemia such as peritonitis or metabolic acidosis.

Question
A 3-day-old male infant presents to the neonatal unit with bilious vomiting and failure to pass meconium since birth despite several rectal washouts by nursing staff over this period. Abdominal examination reveals distension and tenderness. An abdominal X-ray shows dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels suggestive of intestinal obstruction.

Which one of the following is true regarding neonatal intestinal volvulus? 

A. It is more common in females than males
B. The most common site of volvulus is at the ileocecal junction
C. Malrotation and midgut hernias are predisposing factors for neonatal volvulus 
D. Contrast enema should be performed as a first-line investigation to confirm the diagnosis 
E. Surgery is not required if there is no evidence of ischemia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Neonatal intestinal volvulus can occur due to malrotation, midgut hernias or other congenital anomalies affecting the mesentery such as bands or adhesions. It typically presents with bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium within 24-48 hours after birth. Males are affected more commonly than females, and the most common site of volvulus is at the duodenojejunal junction rather than the ileocecal junction seen in adults. Diagnosis is confirmed by an upper gastrointestinal contrast study showing a "corkscrew" appearance of the small bowel or by laparotomy if there are signs of ischemia.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with recurrent episodes of colicky abdominal pain associated with bloating and constipation over the past few months which have been worsening recently despite taking laxatives regularly. On examination, her abdomen is distended but soft with mild tenderness on palpation in all quadrants. Bowel sounds are present but hyperactive.

Which one of the following conditions may lead to chronic colonic volvulus? 

A. Diverticulitis
B. Ulcerative colitis
C. Irritable bowel syndrome
D. Chronic pancreatitis
E. Celiac disease

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Chronic colonic volvulus can occur due to various factors such as redundant colon, chronic constipation, and previous abdominal surgery or radiation therapy. It is more common in elderly patients with underlying medical conditions affecting bowel motility such as Parkinson's disease or diabetes mellitus. Diverticulitis can lead to scarring and narrowing of the colon lumen leading to a "pseudo-obstruction" which may predispose to volvulus. Ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pancreatitis, and celiac disease are not known risk factors for colonic volvulus.

Question
A 28-year-old woman presents to the emergency department at 36 weeks gestation with sudden onset of dyspnoea and chest pain. She has a past medical history of Factor V Leiden mutation and had been on prophylactic enoxaparin throughout her pregnancy. On examination, she is tachypnoeic with oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Her blood pressure is normal, but heart rate is elevated at 110 beats per minute.

What would be the most appropriate management for this patient? 

A. Immediate delivery via caesarean section
B. Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin
C. Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin
D. Insertion of inferior vena cava filter 
E. Thrombolysis

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In pregnant women diagnosed with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is considered as first-line therapy due to its safety profile in pregnancy.

Question
A 35-year-old primigravida presents at 32 weeks gestation complaining of left leg swelling and discomfort that started two days ago which has now progressed to involve her entire leg up to her thigh level along with mild shortness of breath on exertion. She denies any chest pain or coughing episodes.
On examination, there was significant pitting oedema involving the left lower limb extending up to the mid-thigh region without any signs of erythema or tenderness over the calf muscles.
An ultrasound scan confirms deep vein thrombosis in the left femoral vein.

What would be an appropriate treatment plan? 

A. Anticoagulate only after delivery
B. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for the duration of pregnancy and 6 weeks postpartum
C. Warfarin therapy for the duration of pregnancy 
D. Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for the duration of pregnancy and 6 weeks postpartum
E. Inferior vena cava filter insertion

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: LMWH is considered as first-line therapy in pregnant women diagnosed with acute VTE due to its safety profile in pregnancy.

Question
A 27-year-old woman presents at 38 weeks gestation complaining of sudden onset shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up blood-stained sputum, and palpitations that started two hours ago.
On examination, she was tachypnoeic with oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Her blood pressure is normal but heart rate is elevated at 120 beats per minute. Chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary embolism.
She has a past medical history significant for recurrent miscarriages and Factor V Leiden mutation.

What would be an appropriate management? 

A. Immediate delivery via caesarean section
B. Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin
C. Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin
D. Insertion of inferior vena cava filter 
E. Thrombolysis

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In pregnant women diagnosed with massive or submassive pulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically unstable or have right ventricular dysfunction, thrombolytic therapy should be considered after careful assessment of risks versus benefits to both mother and fetus.

Question
A 45-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism presents to the emergency department with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. He has been drinking heavily for the past month and has lost significant weight. On examination, he is disoriented to time and place and has difficulty walking in a straight line. His eye movements are limited in all directions, and he has nystagmus on lateral gaze. Laboratory investigations reveal low thiamine levels. What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Hepatic encephalopathy
B. Acute alcohol withdrawal
C. Wernicke's encephalopathy
D. Korsakoff syndrome
E. Delirium tremens

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presentation of confusion, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and nystagmus in an alcoholic patient with low thiamine levels is highly suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy.

Question
A 60-year-old woman with a history of gastric bypass surgery presents with acute onset confusion and memory loss over the past week. She reports feeling weak and tired but denies any fever or headache. On examination, she appears drowsy but responds appropriately to questions asked by the examiner. There is no focal neurological deficit noted on examination; however, there are signs of peripheral neuropathy present bilaterally in her lower extremities.
What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? 

A. Thiamine deficiency 
B. Vitamin B12 deficiency 
C. Folate deficiency 
D. Iron-deficiency anaemia 
E. Hypothyroidism

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's history of gastric bypass surgery puts her at risk for malabsorption syndromes leading to vitamin deficiencies such as thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency which can lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy.

Question
A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute onset confusion, agitation, and hallucinations. He has a history of alcohol abuse but denies any recent use of alcohol or illicit drugs. On examination, he is disoriented to time and place and has visual hallucinations.

What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Wernicke's encephalopathy
B. Hepatic encephalopathy 
C. Delirium tremens 
D. Acute pancreatitis 
E. Viral meningitis

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's history of alcohol abuse along with elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count suggests hepatic encephalopathy as the cause of his symptoms rather than Wernicke's encephalopathy which typically presents with ophthalmoplegia and ataxia in an alcoholic patient with thiamine deficiency.

Question
A 6-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department with a persistent cough, which has been worsening over the past week. The parents report that the child has had no fever or other symptoms and has been eating and sleeping normally. On examination, the infant appears well-nourished but tachypneic with mild subcostal retractions. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral crackles in all lung fields. Chest X-ray shows hyperinflation of both lungs with peribronchial cuffing.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Whooping cough
B. Bronchiolitis obliterans 
C. Asthma exacerbation
D. Congenital heart disease 
E. Cystic fibrosis

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The clinical presentation of this infant is consistent with whooping cough (pertussis), which can cause severe respiratory distress in infants under six months old who have not yet received their primary vaccination series.

Question
A 45-year-old woman presents to her GP with a persistent cough that has lasted for several weeks, accompanied by intermittent episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath. She reports no recent travel history or exposure to sick contacts but does work as a teacher at a local school where there have been outbreaks of pertussis among students.

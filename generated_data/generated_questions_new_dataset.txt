1. A 45-year-old woman presents with a two-week history of abdominal distension, bloating and constipation. She reports experiencing intermittent sharp pain in her lower abdomen that is relieved by passing gas or having a bowel movement. She has no significant past medical history, takes no regular medication and denies any recent travel or dietary changes.
On examination, the abdomen is distended with diffuse tenderness on palpation. Bowel sounds are present but decreased in frequency.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Irritable bowel syndrome
B. Colonic obstruction
C. Mesenteric ischemia
D. Small bowel obstruction
E. Ovarian cancer

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which commonly presents as abdominal discomfort or pain associated with altered bowel habits such as constipation or diarrhoea.

2. A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a one-day history of severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and inability to pass stool or flatus for three days prior to presentation. He has a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but otherwise healthy.
On examination, his abdomen is markedly distended with diffuse tenderness on palpation and absent bowel sounds.
What is the most likely cause of his presentation? 

A. Sigmoid volvulus
B. Large bowel obstruction due to colon cancer
C. Acute pancreatitis 
D. Abdominal compartment syndrome 
E. Pneumoperitoneum 

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The patient's clinical features suggest acute abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), which can occur due to various causes including trauma, surgery, pancreatitis or massive fluid resuscitation leading to increased intra-abdominal pressure.

3. A 55-year-old woman presents with progressive abdominal distension over several months along with vague abdominal discomfort and early satiety. She has no significant past medical history, takes no regular medication and denies any recent travel or dietary changes.
On examination, the abdomen is markedly distended with dullness to percussion in all quadrants. There is no palpable organomegaly or masses.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Ascites due to liver cirrhosis
B. Ovarian cancer 
C. Peritoneal carcinomatosis 
D. Small bowel obstruction 
E. Mesenteric ischemia

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The patient's clinical features suggest peritoneal carcinomatosis, which can occur as a result of metastatic spread from various primary malignancies including ovarian, gastric or colorectal cancers leading to diffuse involvement of the peritoneum and accumulation of ascitic fluid causing abdominal distension.

4. A 60-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a three-month history of abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, and weight loss. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the epigastric region that is non-tender and immobile. Blood tests reveal elevated levels of CA-19-9 and CEA. An ultrasound scan shows a large pancreatic head mass with dilated intrahepatic bile ducts.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
B. Chronic pancreatitis
C. Gastric cancer
D. Cholangiocarcinoma
E. Hepatocellular carcinoma

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presentation is suggestive of pancreatic adenocarcinoma which commonly presents with epigastric pain radiating to the back, jaundice, weight loss, anorexia, nausea/vomiting and new onset diabetes mellitus or worsening glycaemic control in pre-existing diabetes mellitus.

5. A 50-year-old male presents to his GP with complaints of abdominal pain for two months associated with bloating and constipation alternating with diarrhoea. He has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of colon cancer in his father who was diagnosed at age 55 years old.
On examination, there is diffuse tenderness on deep palpation without any rebound tenderness or guarding noted.
Blood tests show normal full blood count (FBC), liver function test (LFT) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Stool samples are negative for occult blood.
What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. CT abdomen pelvis 
B. Colonoscopy 
C. Upper GI endoscopy 
D. MRI abdomen pelvis 
E. Referral to gastroenterologist 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and family history are suggestive of colon cancer. Colonoscopy is the most appropriate next step for evaluation.

6. A 35-year-old female presents to her GP with a six-month history of abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, and weight loss. On examination, there is a palpable mass in the left iliac fossa that is non-tender and immobile. Blood tests reveal elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). CT scan shows a large retroperitoneal mass.
What is the most likely diagnosis? 

A. Teratoma
B. Lymphoma
C. Germ cell tumour
D. Neuroendocrine tumour
E. Gastrointestinal stromal tumour

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The presentation is suggestive of teratoma which commonly presents as an asymptomatic abdominal mass in young women with raised LDH and AFP levels on blood tests.

7. A 45-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with abnormal vaginal bleeding and discharge. She had a cervical smear test 6 months ago, which showed high-grade dyskaryosis. On examination, the cervix appears normal, but there is some purulent discharge from the cervical os.

What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Repeat cervical smear in 3 months
B. Offer HPV vaccination
C. Referral for colposcopy and biopsy
D. Prescribe antibiotics for suspected infection
E. Refer urgently to gynaecology

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The presence of abnormal vaginal bleeding and discharge along with high-grade dyskaryosis on previous cervical smear warrants referral for colposcopy and biopsy to assess for possible malignancy or pre-malignant changes.

8. A 32-year-old woman has a cervical smear test as part of routine screening programme, which shows low-grade dyskaryosis. She has no significant past medical history and is not currently sexually active.

What would be the most appropriate next step in management? 

A. Repeat cytology in 12 months
B. Colposcopy
C. Return to routine recall 
D. Offer HPV vaccination 
E. Repeat cytology in 6 months

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: In young women with low-grade dyskaryosis who are not sexually active, repeat cytology at an interval of six months is recommended before considering referral for colposcopy.

9.A 50-year-old post-menopausal woman presents with post-coital bleeding and lower abdominal pain that has been ongoing for several weeks.She had a cervical smear test one year ago which was reported as normal.

On examination, there is tenderness over the left adnexa region, but no palpable masses or nodules are detected.The current cervical smear results show high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).

What is the most appropriate next step? 

A. Repeat cervical smear in 3 months
B. Offer HPV vaccination 
C. Referral for colposcopy and biopsy 
D. Prescribe antibiotics for suspected infection 
E. Refer urgently to gynaecology

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Post-menopausal bleeding along with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on current cervical smear warrants referral for colposcopy and biopsy to assess for possible malignancy or pre-malignant changes, especially given the presence of lower abdominal pain and tenderness over the left adnexa region which could indicate pelvic pathology such as ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer.

10. A 2-year-old boy is brought to the GP by his parents, who are concerned about his development. The child has been missing most of his milestones and has a limited vocabulary consisting of only a few words. He also seems uninterested in social interaction and avoids eye contact with others. On examination, the child demonstrates hyperactivity and impulsivity, which makes it difficult for the doctor to carry out an assessment. The patient's mother reports that she had gestational diabetes during pregnancy, but no other significant medical history was noted.

Which of the following conditions could be responsible for this patient's developmental delay? 

A. Down syndrome
B. Cerebral palsy
C. Autism spectrum disorder
D. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
E. Rett syndrome

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The presentation of this patient suggests ADHD as a possible cause for their developmental delay due to symptoms such as hyperactivity and impulsivity, along with delayed speech and social skills. While autism spectrum disorder may present similarly, there is no mention of repetitive behaviors or restricted interests in this case, making ADHD more likely than ASD.

11. A 6-month-old infant is brought to the clinic by her parents because they have noticed that she does not seem to be developing normally compared to other children her age. She can roll from front to back but cannot yet sit without support or crawl on all fours. Her parents report that she does not babble much and rarely smiles at them or responds when they talk to her.

What condition should be considered in this patient? 

A. Global developmental delay 
B. Isolated gross motor skill delay 
C. Congenital hypothyroidism 
D. Muscular dystrophy 
E. Spinal muscular atrophy 

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This patient presents with isolated gross motor skill delay since she is behind on sitting without support and crawling on all fours. There is no mention of delay in other areas such as speech or social skills, which would suggest global developmental delay. Congenital hypothyroidism and muscular dystrophy are unlikely given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms.

12. A 3-year-old girl is brought to the GP by her parents because they have noticed that she has been missing most of her milestones and seems to be falling behind compared to other children her age. She speaks only a few words and does not seem interested in playing with others or making eye contact. On examination, the child demonstrates hyperactivity and impulsivity, which makes it difficult for the doctor to carry out an assessment. The patient's mother reports that she had gestational diabetes during pregnancy, but no other significant medical history was noted.

Which condition could be responsible for this patient's developmental delay? 

A. Fragile X syndrome 
B. Down syndrome 
C. Cerebral palsy 
D. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
E. Rett syndrome 

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: This patient presents with delayed speech and social skills along with hyperactivity and impulsivity, which suggests ADHD as a possible cause for their developmental delay; however, the presence of dysmorphic features such as long face and large ears points towards fragile X syndrome as a more likely diagnosis than ADHD alone.

13. A 25-year-old female patient presents to the GP with concerns about her eating habits and weight loss. She reports feeling guilty after eating, even small amounts of food, and has been restricting her calorie intake for several months. She also admits to engaging in excessive exercise routines, often spending hours at the gym every day. On examination, she appears underweight with a BMI of 16.5 and shows signs of malnutrition such as dry skin and hair loss.

Which of the following is true regarding anorexia nervosa? 

A. It is more common in males than females
B. Patients usually have a distorted body image where they perceive themselves as overweight
C. The onset typically occurs in middle age
D. Amenorrhea is not a common feature 
E. Treatment involves cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and nutritional rehabilitation

Correct Answer: E

Explanation: Anorexia nervosa is characterised by restrictive eating behaviours leading to significant weight loss or failure to gain weight despite being underweight, intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, and disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. It predominantly affects females and typically begins during adolescence or young adulthood. Amenorrhea is a common feature due to hormonal changes caused by low body weight. Treatment involves CBT and nutritional rehabilitation.

14. A 30-year-old male patient presents to his GP with concerns about his binge-eating behaviour over the past few months. He reports experiencing episodes of uncontrollable overeating followed by feelings of guilt and shame afterwards but denies any compensatory behaviours such as purging or excessive exercise routines.

Which of the following statements regarding binge-eating disorder (BED) is correct? 

A. BED only affects individuals who are overweight or obese
B. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of binge-eating without compensatory behaviours
C. It is more prevalent in males than females 
D. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is not an effective treatment for BED
E. Pharmacotherapy with antidepressants is the first-line treatment for BED

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: BED is characterised by recurrent episodes of binge-eating without compensatory behaviours such as purging or excessive exercise routines. It can affect individuals of any weight status, although it is more common in those who are overweight or obese. It predominantly affects females and can lead to significant psychological distress and impaired quality of life. Treatment options include CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

15. A 20-year-old female patient presents to her GP with concerns about her recent weight gain despite engaging in regular exercise and maintaining a healthy diet. She reports feeling bloated after meals and has noticed that she often eats until she feels uncomfortably full.

Which of the following statements regarding bulimia nervosa (BN) is correct? 

A. BN is characterised by recurrent episodes of binge-eating followed by compensatory behaviours such as purging or excessive exercise routines 
B. Patients typically have a distorted body image where they perceive themselves as overweight
C. The onset usually occurs during middle age
D. BN only affects females 
E. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is not an effective treatment for BN

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: BN is characterised by recurrent episodes of binge-eating followed by compensatory behaviours such as purging or excessive exercise routines to prevent weight gain. Patients may also experience feelings of guilt, shame, and low self-esteem related to their eating behaviour. It predominantly affects females and typically begins during adolescence or young adulthood. Treatment involves CBT, which has been shown to be effective in reducing binge-eating frequency and improving overall psychological functioning.
